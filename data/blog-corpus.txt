      So I spent today playing with stuff, and the fruit of my labor is  urlLink here . That's right, I made a new blog, but this one is special, cause I'm hosting it myself :)  Yes, MovableType (a blog making engine) is now installed on my linux box, and so is my blog :-D  Sometime soon, when I get a PCI sound card, I'm going to be transplanting computers around. So I'm *hoping* that all my movable type stuff doesn't get deleted, but if it does, I haven't messed with it that much, so it's all good.

       urlLink This woman  posted "what she wants in a man" on her blog... I find the most recent update to the list quite funny (keep in mind, I haven't read the rest of the blog):   "Part XII  I want a big geek.  I don't necessarily mean a computer geek, although those are fun, and it's amusing to think that saying something like, "but I couldn't, because the file extension was .php! hahaha!" is a turnon.  But I like smart guys, I like men who have a clear interest in something, and I really, really like people who have passions - in other words, geeks.  Particularly ones who babble on like crazy about the thing they're into, and then realize they're doing it, laugh about it, and then maybe accidentally do it some more, realize it again, and then talk about something else. Awfully cute."   Links to the rest of the list (I find it quite entertaining):  urlLink Part I  |  urlLink Part II  |  urlLink Part III  |  urlLink Part IV  |  urlLink Part V  |  urlLink Part VIish  |  urlLink Part VII  |  urlLink Part VIII  |  urlLink Part IX  |  urlLink Part X  |  urlLink Part XI   Yes, this lady puts a lot of thought into all of these... hehe

        ive totally been undedicated to God lately. the thing i love most in the world, and i cant even chase after it. i sure can chase after everything else materialistic and worldy. as ecclesiastes says, a striving after the wind. my whole life this week has been just that. and for the most part, many of the weeks before that.   - Kevin's Blog    I think it's so easy for us to fall into the path of materialism. Holding the posessions we have in such high honor, rather than understanding that they're not that important, they're things God has blessed us with. I've noticed in my life I tend to do this a bit, but not really that much. I'm pretty content with what I have, I think it comes from not really having that much. Sure, there are things that I would like, but really I'm content with what I have and I don't try to get them very much, and if I do and they're taken away, I'm upset for a bit but get over it (IE: Guitar that I don't get back till next month). However I notice just how much Americans as a whole are materialistic. Wealth and levels of achievement really all depend on how much you have, what you have, and how much it's "worth" (how you can put a worth on things that aren't important is beyond me). Americans seem to think that the way to happiness is through things... that's why if you notice, when Americans go overseas they try to give the people things in hopes that it will make them happier.  Just something I'm pondering.

      Well, I had an interesting Valentine's Day... I didn't really do anything that you would identify as a normal V-Day activity. I woke up early... wrote a poem... was written a poem... and then went out with Brady. No, not in some wrong sense.  Brady came and picked me up around 2:30pm... I wasn't sure of what to wear... well, actually I had just gotten out of the shower a bit earlier and didn't have a shirt on yet. I don't think it's anything Brady hasn't seen, so whatever.  ANYway... we had decided the night before we were going to get a new love interest for him, on a limited budget... the answer was unanimous. He needed a new computer. So, we first went to CompUSA to look at parts... mostly cases and power supplies, but we priced other things as well and decided that Fry's would be a bit cheaper for the rest. So we got a pretty nice case, with blue LED lit collums and a nicely lit power supply as well. Then off to Fry's we headed.  Man... it was raining hard when we got there.  So, we went in and figured out where in the store to get what we wanted, then got the help we needed (they have to make an order thing for it)... so we were talking to the guy and told him we wanted 512 MB of ram (and the kind that allowed for the full 800mHz system bus)..... he started a list of ram on the computer screen... and it looked to us like he was trying to somehow swindle us out of hundreds... but that was explained and yeah... it all worked out. We were about to go up and pay when Brady realized he didn't have the checkbook for the account we were planning to get the stuff on... but it all worked out in the end. So, we got the board in one trip (and oh were we happy), then the processor and ram after a short lunch at McDonald's.  Then we went back to Brady's, for three and a half hours of installation. Oh joy... I live for that stuff, so of course I did it. So, we got in the board, ram, power supply, stickers, drives, and other random cool stuff, and flipped on the switch, and after a little work, it all turned on and looks really cool, and works really well.  So, Brady now has a new computer with a 2.8GHz Pentuim 4 processor with HT, a VERY nice Intel Motherboard with the newest Chipset and onboard gigabit ethernet (along with that 800Mhz Bus! And 512kb Cache!), 512MB of DDR400 Ram, some lights, a nice case, and then an old HD that needs replaced in the not too distant future. The ending cost for this major upgrade? $630... not high at all! And it was fun, so it's all good.  I'm going to go now, putting Debian on the mac....

      Yes... apperantly it happened a few years ago... there's some huge cover up or something going on. Bill Gates is dead... For the full story, check out  urlLink this .  For the full video of the event, check out this:  urlLink small   urlLink large .  Yes, apperantly somebody had way too much time on their hands.... and made the independent film  urlLink "Nothing So Strange" . I don't think Microsoft liked it much.

         Oh yes, my beautiful Linux shell, with beautiful motd   Ok, so right now I'm in a big nerd out phase... due to the fact that I've got a debian system (two really, one on each hard drive) working, and... yeah, I'm having fun playing and learning things on them. So far, I've not done much useful, but there is a webserver running. So, if my computers on, if you head  here  you should be able to see the basic debian "your webserver is working" page. Which is pretty nifty, if you ask me. (right now it's down, because I decided I wanted to reinstall it).  In other news, my PC has yet another interface, and is very pretty (in my opinion):     Pretty Interface

              A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs, documents, or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?"         The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of the Tao."                 -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

      So in my tired state, I wrote a poem and put it on my poetry.com thing... maybe it'll win again and get published like a lot of the others, I doubt it though.    When Sleep is Fleeting    Nothing can describe The way I feel at night A time of cold and darkness But warmed beyond belief By thoughts of you. Thoughts of letters written and paths traveled... prayers said... hopeful hearts. The night becomes a somewhat happy place Where my mind wanders onto happy things. Leaving the problems of the day To meet the bliss, that is meeting you. And when I wake I wonder If it will all turn out this way And again I pray That it will be. But I thank God either way... Here for a moment or here to stay, I thank him for what he's done In bringing us to meet this way.

      "ECC 1:2 "Meaningless! Meaningless!"     says the Teacher.   "Utterly meaningless!     Everything is meaningless.""  Don't ever say that to a parent.... at least if they're like my mom is. I said that and she took my guitar and some stuff and said "Well, if it's meaningless than I guess you won't mind me taking this.... yeah... that stunk. Then the asking for it back, standing in the parking lot while she goes around singing what a loser I am and what a hypocrite I am (because of course, my guitar is not meaningless to me and I wanted it back...)  It's been a tough morning, please pray for me.

      Yeah, this song really gives me a lot of hope right now... cause my mom's pretty much going all at it telling me what a failure I'm going to be and how I'm not going to make anything of myself when I'm older (or just telling me to my face that I am a loser). Maybe she's true, but I take comfort in the fact that the worldly measurment doesn't really matter... I'm not looking to be rich of famous, just looking to follow God wherever he leads me.   Lyricz|  4him - Measure Of A Man  This world can analize and size you up and throw you on the scales They can I.Q. you and run you through Their rigorous details They can do their best to rate you And they'll place you on the charts And then back it up with scientific smarts But there's more to what you're worth Than their human eyes can see Oh, I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man Well, you can doubt your worth And search for who you are And where you stand But God made you in His image When He formed you in His hands And He looks at you with mercy And He sees you through His love You're His child and that will always be enough For there's more to what you're worth Than you could ever comprehend Oh I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are   'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man You can spend your life persuing physical perfection There is so much more More than ever meets the eye For God looks through the surface And He defines your worth by what is on the inside I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Oh, I say the measure of The measure of a man Is not how tall you stand, How wealthy or intelligent you are Oh, I've found the measure of a man God knows and understands it For He looks to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines The measure of a man I know, I know   As  much as things at home hurt... make me want to cry(well, I am crying) or leave or just end it all... I take comfort in the fact that the Lord loves me no matter how much I screw up, and he's there for me no matter how far I stray. Well, I try to at least.... truly, it is hard.

      Look at my Archives....   Well, after about a year of Blogging, I've decided to start anew. Since I'm trying a lot lot lot harder to live my life in a way that glorifies God, I figured my blog ought to show that.  I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, and I appologize deeply to those I've hurt... and continued hurting through things I've posted in the past.  I'm sincerely appologizing to anyone I've ever hurt... and hoping that you can all manage to forgive me. Right now, I want to put the past in the past... and start again. New Beginnings.... those are wonderful things. It's true for school, and it's true for life.  Right now, I really feel that the song Ocean Floor, by Audio Adrenaline, really applies.  The mistakes i've made  that cause pain  i couldve done without  oh my selfish thoughts  oh my pride  the things i...  you have forgotten about   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  of the ocean floor   My misdeeds  oh my greive  the things that harm me now  they're not a pretty site to see  but they wipe away  by a mighty, mighty wave...mighty, mighty wave   they're behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  and they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor   take them away...  to return no more...  take them away...  to the ocean floor...to the ocean floor...   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor...  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  all on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased and  they are no more  they're on the ocean floor...    And for that, I am very happy. The wounds I have caused will heal... God will provide for those people.  In that sense, this blog is hopefully going to become a lot less about me, and more about God and what he's doing... though I may throw in a little bit about things going on recently... just a few personal updates... but nothing near what it was before.  So, with that, I'm going to end this post.

      You're probably wondering why I'm posting here again, and not on my personal hosted blog. Well at the moment I'm doing a major overhaul of my netowork infrastructure (IE: I'm installing a router), and I was forced to remove my blog for the computer I normally host it on... I'm thinking about backing up the databases though, not really sure.... I think I will.  Therefore I should still be able to get it back up and running quite quickly.

      "For as long as I shall live I will testify to love I'll be a witness in the silences when words are not enough With every breath I take I will give thanks to God above For as long as I shall live I will testify to love"  I love that song...  I also love punk music I have discovered. I've been listening to New Found Glory, Yellowcard (I love ANYTHING from Ocean Street), and MxPx.

      My Pastor's Daughter Nicole has been diagnosed with cancer in her lymph nodes. They removed one yesterday and don't know if it'd malignant yet, but they think it is so she'll most likely be stuck in chemotherapy. I'm so glad that she's close to Sherrie (my Youth Leader's wife), as Sherrie went through cancer earlier in her life too. Please be praying for her and her family in this hard time.

      Hotmail and Yahoo hate eachother, and thus I hate both of them. Google seems to be the only one who's email service doesn't suck in some way or another.  I've had two emails to yahoo addresses sent from my Hotmail account come back "This message has been delayed", and it's really getting on my nerves.  Other than that... lets see here.  Oh, last night at the fair was fun! I left work at my normal time and went out to Katy's and we just hung around until other people came (Katie was there too)... then we all hung around for a while longer and finally went to the fair. Marjen came so some of us (the ones who didn't want to ride rides) went to meet her while the rest of the people went to do their thing. Umm... then we went to Burgerville and got some food and then we hung out for more time at the fair. I dunno, the fair is cool n' all but gets old fast. I like the tractors though, I could play on the tractors for like hours...  After the fair we all went back to Katy's house and watched Signs in the dark. It wasn't really too creepy, and I discovered I can make the clicking sound the aliens make (it freaks Katy out).  I got home around 1:30am yet still managed to wake up for work this morning... somehow.  I was going to go to a party tonight but I think I will skip it so I'm better able to plan for the weekend... yeah. I could probably get it so my mom would let Sarah come over, but I'm gonna see about going out there and then I'll do the stuff and maybe she can come over next weekend... it'd be cool if we could keep her overnight and bring her to Church again on Sunday too.  Yeah... I'm like killer tired.        On an occaision of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure. - Oscar Wilde, from The Importance of Being Earnest

      Sarah! Read the comment I posted http://stupendoussteve.blogspot.com/2004/07/on-today-and-possibly-tomorrow-and.html#comments   The email I sent you was "delayed", stupid Hotmail.    My Mom gave me a list of things to do and then you  could  come over, I won't be able to get them done by tomorrow, but maybe you can come out here next weekened. That'd be cool :)

           It's almost this slow...     Today has been a really slow day. It's sad when you wish that a server would crash or a hacker would decide your company looks up for the picking, anyway due to the lack of activity I decided to write a blog post. It gives me a chance to close my eyes and let my fingers do the typing... yes, I really do type blog posts with my eyes closed, so if I start randomly saying what I'm dreaming, don't blame me.  Anyway, on today. Yeah nothing too much going on. I didn't want to get up this morning, I was so tired. Sarah and her family got home last night so I stayed up iuntil like 12:30 talking to her cause it's been so long. It was nice to talk, I've missed it. The phone company was stupid and never sent us a phone bill, so they turned off our phone for the moment. My mom's going (or more likely already gone) to go in and yell at them about it today.  After work today I'm going to Katy's and we're like watching a movie until other people come and then everyone's going to the fair. It'll be neat but I'm not riding any rides or spending any money cause I'm broke and don't feel like mooching... I hope people don't decide to go out to eat.  On Friday my boss comes back from his camping trip, he'll find everything almost exactly the same as when he left, which may not sound like a good thing but it is, cause it means I'm not fired.      Saturday... I'm hoping to go to Sarah's on Saturday since we haven't seen eachother for so long. It's not a guarenteed thing but it'd be really nice if I could do. I'll have to check with my mom if it's ok to spend the night cause they've mentioned in the past that it's easier on them and I agree... and I'm not really in a position to complain about them allowing me to spend the night (as if I would complain). I'm hoping to go cause that'd be really awesome... even though I don't have her anniversary present yet (I'm getting it next week!). Also next week I am getting my surround sound speakers and the sound card for my computer, and the optical drives. After that there will only be the two video cards and the three monitors... and of course the desk, and then it will be complete. Fun fun.  I believe that's all I have to say for now, I'll post sometime in the future.

      This is the best mousepad... ever:     I'm more likely to get this one though (because my computer's so droolable):     Maybe I'll get this Instead:     If you go  urlLink here , I want almost everything on there (lol)... and of course my HackerHat

      Man, today I met our resident graphics cool dude... and he's Australian!!! He had a mouse problem (that I fixed quickly thankfully) and yeah, he needed some help. I love their accents, I bet he's popular with the ladies... no really, I bet he is.  I wish I was Australian. Not cause I want to be popular with ladies, one is enough, but it'd be cool to have that accent. Maybe when I'm older I'll move there so my kids get the accent, you know, living my dreams through them.

      So events of the past day or so.  First off, as I mentioned yesterday, Sarah called. That was really cool, made me pretty happy, even though we only talked for like 7 minutes. Shes back late Wednesday night, so I hopefully can see her again soon (its been like 2.5 weeks since Ive seen her).  Last night I was up pretty late talking to a girl on the phone that has a lot of crap going on in her life and was going to use the wrong way out. It was kinda creepy cause I could hear the pill bottles and stuff as she tried opening them. In the end she was going to call a help center and see a counselor, Im going to call later today and check up on how that went man, guys dont realize how much they can ruin a girls life and truly ruin it. This girl wasnt heartbroken by a guy (well, plural), but yeah worse. Guys can be pigs.  Yesterday what else. Oh yeah! So on Saturday this person sent me an email saying I have interesting pictures of your beautiful girlfriend and one of her guy friends. Wanna see?, that was kinda odd, so I said yes. Sure enough Sunday they sent me links to some pictures Jeannette took of Sarah hanging out with some of her friends. One was in the pool and her friend was being goofy, and the other was a group picture where she was standing so close to him, I guess those were supposed to get me upset but yeah, it didnt work. I still have no idea who the person that emailed me was though, very interesting  Today is yet another Monday. I like Mondays right now, other than the fact that Im always tired. They really arent so bad, I mean think about it its a Monday, but if work started on Tuesdays then everyone would hate Tuesdays, so I dont see the problem. Today my boss is going to be there for a little bit (maybe), and then Im on my own for the week. I hope nothing drastically blows up (hmm yes I do hope this).  Woo, more computer parts should be coming today! Unless FedEx is stupid. Which they may be, you never know.

      Mmmm... nothing going on. Life's very bland recently.  Brianna called me last night which was cool 'cause we haven't talked for a while. I think she called me some other time recently but I don't quite remember. We were talking about how laid back I am... I suppose it's pretty true.  laid-back (ldbk) adj. Informal  Having a relaxed or casual atmosphere or character; easygoing: laid-back, untroubled people  Yep, that is me, lol. I don't (except for some important things) really take things overly serious, I guess it helps to keep the stress down. I'm getting to wherre I need to take school seriously though, next year is going to be stressful... but livable.  This summer so far has been pretty slow, yet it's gone by quickly (that really doesn't make sense). I'm hoping I can get into the same thing next year, an extra $3000 would be useful.  I put Debian on my work laptop this morning... man, I put Debian on everything I can get my hands on. The first Linux Distro I installed, and by far my favorite. The best part is it works just fine :)

      I must do my greatest thinking on the Max its when my mind is clear and tired at the same time.  Next week is gonna rock. My boss Jeremy is on vacation, so Im gonna be the head computer guy at the company. Means Ill have the keys to the server rooms and the storage areas, which will be cool too. Hopefully its an easy week and no servers decide to blow up or raid arrays decide that its time to give up on life. Well, Jeremys got a pretty good setup, so Id be surprised if anything other than that happened, because of course hardware failures are next to impossible to forecast.  Wow, someone on the max line has some weird seagulls in their yard, and the girl sitting behind me has really strong perfume, at least its a good scent.  I should read the classifieds over the person in front of mes shoulder Ooo, a Classic 1972 Ford is selling for only $1675 it may be classic but I bet its not worth too much.  -15 Minutes Later-  Ah, now Im on the bus. Interesting people ride the bus usually there are quite a few normal people, though at this moment they seem in short supply. Across from me in the seats is a couple the man looks around 25 or older and the girl looks like she might be 14 (maybe younger?) kinda sick if you ask me. Now onto the bus come the more normal people the preppy girls (if you can call them normal). All flaunting their looks and smiling if they notice you glancing at them, even if its just because you want to write them into your blog post. I feel like Harriet the Spy, thats kinda cool. I should use my bus rides to work on my descriptions for writing, as there are always new eople I havent seen before (in fact I think theres only two people Ive even recognized on the bus, I knew neither of them though).  Over in the corner sits a man reading the paper sports section, of course. Hes most likely a construction worked or the like, his shoes show a quite a bit of wear and hard use, and hes in need of a shave, or to let it grow. His glasses seem clean enough, as do his clothes, but his hat is a bit outdated (saying 2000 The New Millenium). The bus driver finally makes his way onto the bus, and the few stragglers that will not get on the bus until the driver is there finally come in. Theres a lady that keeps talking to herself in Chinese it sounds or maybe shes speaking in tongues either way nobody even gives her a second glance. Theres a Spanish guy across from me that has nothing really to mention. He looks like many of the Hispanics in the area, trying to be preppy but not looking the roll in the least. Preppy girls show they have some thought, theyve slightly turned and are staring at the lady that is holding a conversation with herself shes even throwing in hand gestures now, and this guy across from me that looks like an Eminem wannabe mentions shes doing that because nobody listens to her so she has to talk to herself. The bus stops an old lady with frizzy white hair comes on, and a guy that looks like he likes football. The crazy lady goes and stands at the front of the bus (still inside, but I'm sitting in the back), and football guy gives her a wide eyed look when she walks past. Now she comes and sits by my laptop case still talking in her unknown language. Eminem looks like hes about to burst into laughter I suppose I can understand that. Construction guy in the corner is leaning against the window sleeping. I would think that hat would be pretty uncomfortable Eminem starts giggling, says its a joke but its more likely about the lady talking random nothingness.  This man with a CD player that looks like he could be a software developer, but probably isnt, mentions my assortment of goodies. Pocket PC, Laptop I suppose there are some goodies, all Im missing is a cell phone.  We stop at another stop (by now weve passed a few, but nobody of note either entered or left the bus  those preppy girls are probably headed to the mall now that I think about it) nobody of note gets on. We drive onwards. I notice the laptop battry is at 77%, where it was fully charged before leaving work, yes I think sometime soon this will need replaced. Babbling lady gets up and heads to the front of the bus again, and Eminem gets that dumb grin on his face. Then she sits in the front next to a woman that would probably rather be somewhere else right now. Looking at football, I can see hes probably a construction worker too, or a painter (he has some paint on his shorts). His shoes are beat up and he has a hat that says Hansen, but not the band (probably a construction company). He sits up straighter than an arrow, probably was once in the military or something. The old lady with the frizzy hair gets off, leaving babbling woman on her own I wonder if this was really her stop or if she just needed to get away. I cant really say which Id do  We stop at the bus stop by the old Beaverton City Library this is usually where a couple hundred Mexicans get on and off the bus, but I guess its too early for them to be out. Some guy gets on that looks like a hippie and a biker mixed, with his bandana. He apparently has no idea where he is or what bus hes on, as the driver talks to him for a while. Eventually he does sit down. I notice were passing Denny road, which means there is only Hart before my stop, so Im going to go now. Hope you enjoy this :)

       urlLink This  is a very sweet music player. Made by Commodore (yes, they ARE still around... at least I think so), so it's got to be awesome.  Speaking of Commodore, and Awesome. Check out  Machinae Supremacy  is a band with a huge download section, and one of the first (or only?) bands to make SiD Metal. That being hard (metal) rock being played along with Commodore 64 SiD Chips. I need to learn how to program my Commodore to play music, all I ever did with it was some symphony out of a book (which of course I quickly put on a disk... which I have since lost).  My days during the week are pretty bland. I get up in the morning (with a bit of trouble recently, I need to sleep more) and go to work... there I do stuff, and sit at my desk, and do stuff there, and then at like 4:30 I go home. Once there I pretty much do the same thing I did at work. It may sound boring, and at times it is, but really I'd be bored just sitting at home all day anyway (and hey, I'm getting payed for this).  Tomorrow Armaan is having a party somtime, I'm not sure when or where (though I'd assume his house). It's likely that I'll take the bus to hart road and walk up to his house from (pretty close to) Adri's, which will be fun and relaxing, and also very warm if weather holds out the way it's been (Man, Sarah must be loving it over in Hawaii... and also getting really burnt).  I've discovered the niceness of headphones at work. I can rock to music off the laptop (which has far superior sound to the PDA) and still umm... "work".  As much as I talk about not working at work, usually I do end up with quite a bit to do. Like the other day I had to change a file in every computer... thankfully I can do that over the network, but it was still tedious. Well, back to my IM's... hehe.

      "I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name, PS I love you, forever and today."   I'm in a petty chipper mood today, which could be expected I suppose, as I got most of a full night's sleep. I think tonight I'll be going to bed at 9, because I'm still really behind on da sleep for some reason.   I was so annoyed at my mom yesterday. I had been telling her like all week that I was getting payed on Tuesday and needed her home so I could go to the bank and put money in and use the check card to order computer parts. So what's the one day she plans stuff and doesn't get home until 11:30? Why Tuesday of course. I was really impatient and stuff, but I got over that when I really thought about it, because realy I can afford to get the stuff anytime, as I'll be broke  after  getting it so I won't be able to get more parts anyway.   "Best friend worst thing, she's been cheating, friend decieves she leaves"   I'm such a slacker, I still haven't gotten Sarah her anniversary present. I know what it is now, I just haven't gone to the store to buy it. I really hope she likes it though... she will of course but I'm required to think like that (hehe).   "Alone with you... alone with me... what can I do I cannot breathe"   I think I fell asleep at work yesterday... like, fell asleep without being asleep. My mind just went away for an hour. It was ok though, I (thankfully) didn't get any new work to do in that time, so I wasn't like messing up on things or what not. I really like this laptop a lot more than my normal work computer... it hurts my eyes less and I can use it (again) on the Max.   Now since I have nothing else to say, a random song or two:   The Ataris - The Saddest Song  Only two more days, until your birthday  Yesterday was mine  Youll be turning five  I know what its like, growing up without your father in your life   So I pretend,  Im doing all I can  And I hope someday youll find it in your heart  To understand  Why Im not around  And forgive me for not being in your life   I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all   Maybe someday  You really get to know me  Not just the letters read to you  I pray I get the chance  To make it up to you  We got a lot of catching up to do   So I pretend,&nbsp;  Im doing all I can  And hope someday youll find it in your heart  To understand  Why Im not around  And forgive me for not being in your life   I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Remember waiting there to find nothing at all  I remember waiting  For you to come  Remember waiting  For you to call  Waiting there to find nothing at all   Forgive me!  Im so sorry!  I will make it up to you....    Avril Lavigne - Things I'll Never Say   I'm tuggin' at my hair  I'm pullin' at my clothes  I'm tryin to keep my cool  I know it shows   I'm staring at my feet  My cheeks are turning red  I'm searching for the words inside my head   I'm feeling nervous  Tryin' to be so perfect  Cause I know you're worth it  You're worth it--yeah   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   It don't do me any good it's just a waste of time  What use is it to you what's on my mind  It ain't comin out we're not going anywhere  So why can't I just tell you that I care   Cause I'm feeling nervous  Tryin' to be so perfect  Cause I know your worth it   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   What's wrong with my tongue  These words keep slipping away  I stutter I stumble like I've got nothing to say   Cause I'm feeling nervous  Trying to be so perfect  Cause I know you're worth it  You're worth it--yeah   I guess i'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say   If I could say what I want to say  I'd say I want to blow you--away  Be with you every night  Am I squeezing you too tight  If I could say what I want to see  I want to see you go down--on one knee  Marry me today  Guess I'm wishing my life away  With these things I'll never say  These things I'll never say

      I seriously love that my boss let me borrow the laptop.... there's nothing better than riding the max and typing a blog post at the same time, even if I can't post it until later... plus this keyboard is big and non-spongy, which would make anybody happy.   Today is payday (yay!), I'm ordering more computer parts (enough to finally start using the thing!) and also hopefully getting something for Sarah before she gets back from Hawaii.  I really haven't been up to too much... the sad thing about having a job is that when everyone else has no problem just doing things at random times, I kinda have to wait and hope they plan something for a weekend, which they do usually but not always.   Last Friday night (well, more Sunday morning) I went to Andrew's with Armaan until around 5:30am. That was pretty fun as I've never really hung out with Andrew much, nor been to his house. I think he thinks I'm an idiot but whatever, he wouldn't be entirely off in thinking that. Actually, I don't think he thinks that, I just think he's hard to red so I assume he's somehow hostile. After hanging out at Andrew's, we went to Danie's for the xfiles Marathon we had planned. We took a walk and did watch a couple of episodes, but most of the time was pretty hang-outish (which is always really fun... more fun than just watching DVD's if you ask me). I think it's kinda cool that Armaan's friends let me hang out with them so much, because I don't really have many friends of my own (I say Armaan's friend's but I guess somewhere they became mine too, as we do things without Armaan sometimes too). I was so tired by the time I got home, but I slept well later in the evening.   Sarah's still in Hawaii, she left on Sunday and is getting back on Wednesday next week. She's going to call me on Saturday if possible, so I'm trying not to plan anything for Saturday. It's hard not to, I may end up turning down a party that Mandy is planning, which would be sad, but I'd rather hear from Sarah.   Today, July 20, marks umm.... some odd days until School starts (I  believe  it starts on the 8th of September). Thank Goodness I get payed on such a regular basis, as I will really be pushing it with finishing that computer... oh, and I'll be even closer to the line of brokeness as I most likely need to buy a new desk to house it. Ah well, that's the way things work out.   Well, it's almost my Max stop, so I'm gonna finish this up. I don't really know what else to write about anyway..... we'll see if anything worth talking about happend at all this week. Armaan is planing a party for Thursday, and planning on seeing the Bourne movie... whatever the new one is. I won't be able to see the movie, but I hope I'm able to go to the party.

      Ooooo, blogger has wysiwyg editing now. That's pretty nifty, spiffy, and all around neato. &nbsp; I'm thinking about changing my template sometime, but I probably won't for a while. What do you think? If there's something blue I'd probably be happy with it. &nbsp; Man, I was sooooo tired this morning. I was up until like 1, after getting home ar like 12:20, after trying to clean up something that's talked about in  Armaan's Blog .... yeah it was interesting. &nbsp; Today at work I'm actually working on some stuff. We're changing some phone ports into fax ports and going to put fax software on people's computers/laptops if they want it. It means I get to play around with the switch board in the phone room... not my favorite activity (when you go to press the wires in they spark a little, it's creepy). But at least it beats sitting in front of the computer trying to make my character counter go up more.... so I guess that's good. &nbsp; It's almost lunch time, thank goodness... I'm hungry.

      Ok, so today has been very much without any activity... well ok, there was a small bit, and I have been installing Debian pretty much all day, but it's still been pretty slow. I think tomorrow I will bring a book, I need something to take up my time when I'm not working on anything. Today we got to RMA (IE: send in a return) a huge monitor, the box weighed like 50 pounds. Stupid ViewSonic is so cheap that they make us pay shipping even on the returns (wish they were like gateway). Ah well, I guess I can't expect everyone to be perfect. It amazes me how people in the "real world" act. This whole summer I've been surrounded by the real world, during the day at least. The people swear when things happen, they don't have a problem with it... and yeah... hmm, I guess that's really all they do. Oh yeah, they do one more thing. The term "get a life" doesn't apply to these people, as their job is their life. I guess in other words, it's their carreer. I guess you really do want to make sure you love whatever you decide to do as a career.  &nbsp;  Oh yeah, Armaan got his ear pierced. Crazy kid.

        Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most. (Please Vote)    urlLink   What Emotion Dominates you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     That's a sad story :-\ I don't think I'm that sad....

      Wow... the whole last sentence ("oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!") of my last post sounds like Sarah.... that's creepy.  Yesterday after work I went to Forrest Grove and met Peter and Pat, then we went up to Brady's and I got to see my baby (my firstborn you could say... that sounds too weird to say though). After a while we went to Washington Square and met Armaan and goofed around at the Apple Store. It was fun and I'm sure the salespeople hated me especially (I love it, really I do).  After that we went to Subway but it was closed, so we went to McDonalds and ate random food (2 cheeseburgers! Wow!). On the way out I spotted my old friends from Frosh and Soph years, Brodi and Sam (they graduated my Soph year). They didn't see me but we ended up walking a ways behind them, and then there were tons of people from back then. So I got to see Brodi, Sam, Jenny, Maggie, and Amanda again... and I'm sure more people that I totally didn't notice... yeah that was really cool. They were all commenting on how much older i am, it was weird...  Pat was feeling sick so we went to Armaan's and hung out there watching videos from the other night, until parents came to get us (though Pat spent the night).  When I got home I walked into my room to find that my computer case had arrived a day early... so i stayed up a little too late fiddeling with it and a laptop I grabbed from Armaan.  That's really about it.  Goodness I hope I can get to Vancouver sometime this week...

      Today at work we had an "All Hands Meeting". Pretty much it was about the State of the Company.  I didn't know it but apperantly the Company is being bought in November or December, and changing it's name (though still being the same thing). It's too bad I'm only an intern, I think it'd be cool to be here for that.  After the meeting they had cake, and they had Carrot Cake! It's seriously the best stuff in the world... with it's wonderful creame cheese frosting... oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!

      I actually had a pretty good weekend. It was busy (thankfully) and passed pretty quickly.  Lets see... on Friday I worked until my usual 4:30ish time, and then I came home. Sarah called me around 7 from camp which was cool because I was missin her a bit (hehe). Nothing much else happened today, which was ok.  Saturday... today was a really busy day that never actually ended. My morning was pretty dull... just hanging around the house cleaning up my room (it's still a mess, but I can see the floor!). Later in the Evening I went to my Aunt's and ate chinese food with the folks... Mmmm, I love Fried Rice. We came home at just the right time, because not 10 minutes after I sat down I heard my name from outside, and Peter was there. So he came over and we talked for a bit and played with computer stuff, and then he had to go catch his bus home... which he missed... and it was the last bus out. So we decided he'd spend the night (with permission, of course). Well around 2 we started getting bored, and then I noticed good ole Carinsdev on AIM. So we IM'd Armaan and it ended up he picked us up and we hung out all over.  We went to this cool construction zone and explored and had interesting exploits with spray paint, cones,  and wireless network cards. Then breakfast at McDonalds.... Mmm good times. I got home around 7:30 and went to sleep while Peter did stuff. Then we went to Church and dropped Peter off at a bus stop so he could head home.  After Church my mom went to her friends house and I went with her and saw The Butterfly Effect. It's a very weird and twisted movie, but actually pretty good... though I wouldn't suggest seeing it if you're depressed. After the movie I went to Becky's house and hung out for a while. They're so funny... they made some (really real looking!) dummies and stuck them in their neighbors living room... amoung other things. Over there I watched The Secret Window... which is a really creepy movie. I actually kinda liked it though... because I've always kinda wished the "bad guy" didn't get caught for once, and it happened.  I rode the bus home because I didn't want to wait for my mom to be done at her friends, and I found out that Sarah's bus broke down in the middle of nowhere on the way home... though as I woke up this morning I discovered she'd gotten home and told me she was safe, so that's a relief.  Now here I am at work... listening to The All-American Rejects and not really having much to do. I can't wait until payday.... I need to figure out what to get someone for a 6 month aniversary....

      Ok I've decided what I'm going to do with this place (since at the moment I don't have a place to host another site). I'm gonna use this thing to do the normal, usual, "Today I...", and the uh... other one... to talk about uh... other things ( ;) at some).  Soooo, to start.  I've started construction on a new computer that's going to totally rock... well let me rephrase that, I ordered a few components. I will begin the construction as soon as I recieve them. I was planning on getting a laptop, but I decided a desktop was more economical for me and what I'm using. So here are the basic stats of the computer I'm building:  Motherboard -  Intel D875PBZ Motherboard   Processor -  Intel Pentium 4, 3.2ghz with 800mhz FSB and 1mb L2 cache, includes Hyperthreading   Ram -  1gb (2 512 sticks) Corsair 184pin Dual Channel DDR400   Hard Drive -  Maxtor 200GB 7200RPM IDE Hard Drive   Optical Drives -       .: Sony Black 52x32x52x16 Combo Drive (CD-RW/DVD-ROM)       .: ASUS Black 52X QuieTrack Technology CD-ROM Drive   Power Supply -  ASPIRE ATX-AS500W   Video -  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 256mb DDR ram  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX5200 128mb DDR ram, Dual-Head   Monitor(s) - ( 3 of them! )  SCEPTRE X7g-Komodo V 17" LCD Monitor   Sound - ( 1 ,  2 ) Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum PCI Sound Card (THX Certified)  Speakers - ( 1 ,  2 ) Logitech THX Certified Z-680 5.1 500watt Speakers  That whole thing is costing me around $2,600. Not too shabby if I do say so myself.

      Hum, I'm thinking I'm overbudget on my computer somewhere and thus will not have enough for the three monitors I was going to get. We shall see how much I actually make eh? But if I don't have enough, I guess I'll just save my money for a while, after all, with everything else it's got I think I can be satisfied with only one monitor... or maybe two.  Tomorrow I'm going to be spending a hefty amount of money... well not spending all of it, but getting it out. First is $104 for Saturday and gifts. I'm bringing $40 for movies and food, and $5 to give Sarah to turn in for the beach trip in two weeks (which I mentioned to my mom and she didn't seem to have a problem with), $4 for an all day bus ticket for Sarah, and then another odd amount for the gifts I am getting her for our Anniversary last month. Armaan is going to be back by Saturday so it's possible he might go see the movie (The Village) with us or something, that'd be cool. Maybe I can get him to pick me and Sarah up, though it'd be quite a drive... hum.  On top of the money for Saturday, I'm also getting some pictures developed and buying a few more computer things (Drives, Sound Card, Video card, and a desk). After that I may well be almost done with the whole computer thing, just getting speakers and then taking a break to see if I'll have enough for monitors or not... yes it's fun.  The first week of school I am planning on getting the stupid proof of enrollment form so I can get my permit, and then I probably won't keep the permit for he full time you're "supposed" to have it, just until I'm a pretty good driver and stuff... I cannot wait. That's why I should save the extra ~$1000 that I would have left over if I don't worry about the monitors...

      Another slow day at work. I have done nothing today, but it's ok.  Armaan left I believe yesterday for his vacation to Six Flags, and I believe they're down in San Francisco at the moment. From the audiopost on his blog it sounds like an interesting trip so far... not really too fun though. Man I wish I could go on cool vacations... i havent in like... a long long time.  I'm really really really really hoping Sarah's parents will let her come over next Saturday. I'm doing lots of work at home so my mom will be ok with it, and I've got a lot of stuff planned (like... the whole day), in the end it just depends on if they'll let her come. I don't know that they're liking me too much anymore... I'm not sure... it'd be sad if they didn't :( Well, I don't think her Dad has a problem with me, but her Mom is (I think) starting to want me not to be around her very much. Oh well, we'll get older and that won't be a problem, and I can hope that it isn't true.  I was talking to this guy today about retirement trusts... they actually sound like  really really good idea. You can stick $1350 in a trust and wait 5 years, then retire and you get $87,000, and then a check for $9,300 a Month for the rest of your life. Is that crazy or what? I might put the money into it next year assuming I get another job, that would be so cool to retire right out of college (LOL), and only have to work because I want to rather than because it's a requirement.... like... I could be a developer or something! Neato dorrito.  Humm, what else... School starts on the 7th or 8th of September, after that no more work for me. It's bittersweet in many ways, I will like the break that school will be (it takes less time out of the day), but I will have homework. On top of that I will not have income again, and I probably won't get to see Sarah as often. I want to get into at least seeing her every two weeks... I really need my license.   When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President; I'm beginning to believe it. - Clarence Darrow

      Today (now actually yesterday, though my body-clock still thinks it's today) was fun overall.  The turkey bowl turned out to be held at Century High School instead at of one of the church's fields (no mud - a good thing).  I have come to a realization; I suck at football. :)  It still was pretty fun though, there were only three or four people that actually played well, so again, it was fun.  Those four hours were filled with little oddities, ranging from Patrick drinking beer out of a crushed can, to the Century crowd upending the field goal posts, to Cori ripping my backpack, to Nicole later running over it with her car.  I have some quirky friends. :)  Well in reality I'm probably more screwed up then they are. ;)   Anyway, after that Goody and I decided that we wanted to go to Fry's to take advantage of a really good one-day sale.  We attempted coursing numerous people to transport us there, and finally after much misunderstanding, my mom took us.  When we got there, we met an hour-long line which my mom (cool as she is) stayed in for us while we hunted for the stuff we wanted.  As it turned out, the entire trip was a futile effort since almost all the items we wished to procure had sold out long before we got there.  Oh well, it meant that I got to spend more time with Goody, and I am thankful for at least that.    Well, I'm running on steam, and even that's about to give out so I'd better end it there for tonight (this morning - lol).  Listening to:  Deadbeat Holiday - Greenday

      Ok, I guess I'll finally succumb to the ever-increasing crowd of bloggers and start my own.  This is Thanksgiving morning, and I'm slightly looking forward to it... We've finally broken the trend of having 40+ people over, and are just going to have 10 to 20.  If all goes, as is our custom, we'll be up till way past 2:00am.  Oh brother, I just remembered I'm going to a turkey bowl (mud football for those uninformed few) tomorrow morning.  *groan*  That wouldnt be much of a problem, if it weren't for the sleep (or lack there of) that I have been getting over the last week.  From Friday to Monday, I got around 14 hours of sleep TOTAL. Well, whatever... I'll take each day as it comes.  Just a random note:  I love Grand Prize - been listening to them non-stop for 20-some-odd hours (fell asleep to them) and... and ... oh, nevermind.  (This was actually written at 10:36am, November 28th, but due to errors on my part, I have had to repost it now.)

      The 21st???  Dang, I haven't posted for a long time!  *reaches into the deep recesses of his brain in effort to pull out memories of everything that has happened in the last week and 'a half*    On Monday the 23rd, I went to the Christmas party our youth group put on with Gwen.  It was pretty fun and sporadic - kinda like youth group normally is - hmm... I wonder why... :)  On Tuesday, the 24th, I went to see LotRs again with quite a few more people, but I woke up around 12:10, and the movie started at 1:00, so I had barely enough time to make it the theater.  I was going to invite Gwen to it, but I didn't even know the time we were supposed to be there, until right after I woke up - dumb of me.  Then, on Christmas the (come on now, everyone knows that date), we had around 45 ppl over, including the Lundins, and the [L]Andersons.  We pretty much screwed around the entire night, and got nothing productive done.  Later, on Thursday the 26th (is this even necessary anymore?), I had lunch at Gwen's house, and met her family - specifically her dad, who I talked to at some length concerning taking her to the banquet.  He's a cool guy.  Well, actually, in a broader view, they're a cool family. *If only my family weren't so dysfunctional, then maybe we'd be 'cool' in some sense as well*  hmm... wishful thinking.  One unfortunate highlight was when she asked me a rather simple, direct question - in what manner was I inviting her to the banquet? As a friend, or more?  For some reason that I still cant figure out, I balked, and offered no straight answer, and she dropped it. (Though after much thought concerning the emotional well being of both of us at such an early stage, I called her back the next day and confirmed that we were still on officially 'just friends', but subject to change.)  Early Saturday morning (like 5:15, which was bad, cause I got to sleep at around 3:00), I got up, and my dad drove me out to a starbucks near my cousins' old house, where I met my uncle, and drove all the way over to Mt. Bachelor to go skiing.  I can't believe how stinkin' bad I was at first.  I was REALLY out of practice.  My uncle is a very advanced skier, but for some reason he decided to snowboard. It looked rather funny watching him, because he turned out to be a worse snowboarder than I was a skier.  After several hours, we drove back to Redmond and met the rest of my family at my other uncle's vacation "cabin" (or at least, that's what he made it out to be...).  It turned out to be a gated 2,700 square foot house with a three-car garage, and a 100-acre luxury golf course bordering the back lawn.  The subdivision even had it's own private indoor / outdoor pool, and fitness center.  My cousins and sisters and I got little sleep because of my newly acquired Xbox, and matching HALO. :)  We went to a church the next morning, and I was so unbelievably tired, that I almost slept though the sermon.  We went back to the super-cabin and I took a five-hour nap, completely missing my family's trip to the best Chinese restraunt under Oregon sun.  Once I woke up, we played more HALO, and finally got bored, and went to the pool complex around 9:00.  After and hour of swimming inside, we got bored yet again, and decided to go make use of the hot tubs out in the snow.  We did that for about half an hour, and got tired of it, so we went and rolled around in the snow for a little while, and got back in again.  After quite a while later, we decided that the ice forming in our hair wasn't such a good thing after all, and retreated back to our mega-cabin.  Then, this morning, we got up, and went to the mountain yet again, and messed around in the snow for another hours or so, and then drove all the way back home, with a short stop at an Izzy's in Bend.  Tomorrow, my youth group is having a big New Year's party from 6:30, to 1:30 (or something like that...), and I want to invite Gwen to it.  Though there is a possibility that she's going to her church's New Year's overnighter... Something I was going to go to, but for lack of funds.  It's late, and I'm tired - need sleep, must go...  P.S. I am an anti-Andrewist  (don't ask)

      I finally got my Learner's Permit on Tuesday, after month of being to lazy to get my parents to go with me to DMV.     Wednesday (my 16th birthday) was rather uneventful.  The majority of my family local to this area went to Old Country Buffet in Beaverton to celebrate.  Fun, I guess...  I got a Van de Graff generator which, upon assembly, fail to operate.  That was a rather large disappointment, since I had spent almost 5 hours on it.    Yesterday, We had our "Christmas party" of sorts at school, and I finally invited Gwen to the Winter Banquet (after several schedule conflict which I had to resolve before I even knew if I was going to go), but now my parents are getting more restrictive, and saying that I should ask her to pay for her own ticket, because if I pay for it, it'll be a "date"...  I never really got that reasoning, but I guess I'll just have to flow with it...    Later that afternoon, Goody's family (minus two siblings), Peter, Rachael, Emily, and I went to see  The Two Towers .  It was way better than I thought it was going to be, but I was expecting more people to be coming.  Later when I got home, I received a message from Brady informing me that I had not, in fact invited them to it, though I had been operating the last couple day, with the expectation of seeing them there...  Really stupid of me.   Consequentially, I am prolly going to go see it again with them within the next week.

      I actually ended up going to see Nemesis right after school on Thursday with Gwen, Brady, Cori, Cameran, and Matt.  It was a cool movie, as far as Star Trek movies go...  I slept in on Saturday (I really needed it - had had almost no sleep the past week), and helped cater at a Christmas play done by Southwest Hills that night.  I think I ate one meal the entire day. :)  I got to Calvary slightly early on Sunday, cause the tech guys were testing a new digital board, and I was riding with some of the musicians.  During second service, Brady, Steven, Cameran, Emily, and I walked a couple blocks over to Carl's Jr. ... in the pouring rain ... in my suit.  :)  We spent prolly 45 minutes over there, and walked back.  I then donned a regular jacket in place of my suit, and we walked a couple more blocks over to the theater to buy tickets for another showing of Nemesis.  After we all saw the movie (all 25 of us), I went over to Goody's house and stayed for about half an hour before getting picked up, and driven back home.  Today, by contrast, was rather uneventful.  Oh, and I finally got Gwen's aim screen name, after weeks of forgetting to ask her for it.  :)  *Happy*  Feeling: Hunger, Tiredness, Anxiety about the upcoming Learner's Permit test tomorrow.

      Again, I haven't posted for a while.  This last week or so has been really busy (as usual).  My parents were out of town on Monday, and I stayed over night at Brent's house.  Going to and from school on Tues. was annoying cause a had a couple huge bags with me, besides my school stuff.  SWHB youth group on Tuesday was pretty fun - nothing that much out-of-the-ordinary happened, it was just fun.  Last night's CCWC youth group was better, though.  Afterward, Brady, Cori, Steven, and I walked over to Carl's Jr., in the rain, and got milkshakes of all things.  :)  I'm looking forward to the growth group I have tomorrow night (at the bowling alley), seeing  Nemesis  on Sunday, my birthday on Wednesday, and possibly going to see the Nutcracker Ballet on Thursday.

      Hmm... I haven't posted in a while.  I'm still sick, and on Thursday I skipped school, partly because I wasn't feeling good, and partly because I was tired.  ( I think they're interchangeable)  Anyway, because of it, I'm slightly backed up in school work.  Yesterday I went to two basketball games between my school and my best friend's and we lost to them (both the girl's game, and the guy's).  It was kinda funny.  I stayed over night at his house afterward, and we just sat around lazy, doing nothing. It was fun. :)  Missed helping out at church (laying sod and stuff) cause we slept in, but whatever.  I would have been really tired anyway, after it.    Oh, Brady suddenly got his sight back on Wednesday night! I'm really happy for him.

      Not much to say about today, except Rachael told me that she found out from one of the Lundin's that I used to be obsessed with her during our choir years.  Hahahaha  I think that's kind of funny, cause I haven't the slightest recollection of it.  ...Whatever...  Oh, also my dad blew up at my tonight, for reasons as of yet unknown, and wouldn't let me go to youth group.  He's been doing ALOT of stuff like that lately.  I might go into more detail in a later post, but I see no real reason right now.  Brady (my friend that went blind last Sunday) is doing really well, all things considered.  He is a strong Christian, and I am really thankful that he has not become too discouraged or depressed (at least as far as I can tell).  Well, Gods plans are many times not our own, and we just have to trust Him to work out everything for the best in all of this.  Feeling: Tired, Annoyed, and Mad at my runny nose  ;)

      Arrg! I hate colds!  I just got one last week, and it wasnt bad until Sat. morning when it reared its ugly head.   (Of course, given the fact that I knew that I had a cold, it wasnt the brightest idea to eat all those cookies last night) but in any event, my cold did get worse.  I am rather annoyed that it kept me from church this morning, even if it was just Southwest Hills Baptist, not Calvary Chapel.  Whatever - church is church no matter the location I guess.  I am really hoping that tomorrow is off school, cause I still don't have the final draft of my report done... I'm thinking that I probably should go attend to that...  [This was written almost an hour after the above]  Man, this is insane, I just found out that my friend Brady collapsed in the middle of service today at my church, with a migraine and went blind.  I'm talking to him on im right now... he's using voice recognition.  This is too weird...

      Well, last Friday and Saturday were the pinnacle of fun for this year for me.  Around 3:00pm on Friday, my dad picked me up from school, and took me to church to grab one of our projectors.  I then drove home and arrived about five minutes before Brady did.  Andrew and Steven showed up about half an hour later, and we set up three Xboxs (for HALO), the projector, and several TVs.  Around 5:00pm, most of the other people (Matt, the other Matt, another Andrew, David, Ben, Sasha, Jeremy, Adam, Cameran, Peter, and Pat) arrived. We set up the other two Xboxs, two Gamecubes, and an original NES (Ben's).  Networking the Xboxs turned out to be rather troublesome, and in the end, David and I had to go get another cable from CompUSA.  We got back, ate, and played a ton of LAN games (HALO) until Goody and Kevin finally arrived (around 11:30pm).  We then had some dessert, and opened random presents.  Pat got me a really tight airsoft gun. :)    Anyway, around 12:30, we moved two Xboxs and the projector down into the first story (mostly guest and storage rooms, the second is the main living area, and the third is where all out bedrooms are), and just basically stayed hunkered down there for about a couple hours while Ben serenaded us with the keyboard and techno stuff.  By about 3:00am, we were all feeling slightly hyper / tired - a weird state to be in.  All of us that were in the main storage area, were acting really weird, doing really stupid (or in Ben's case, amazingly good) techno dances and just generally messing around.  I suddenly go the bright idea to get out or camcorder, and videotape everything.  Before long, I got bored of it, and Ben and Kevin started messing around with it.  Eventually, all three of us suddenly ran out of the house, and up to the road, and proceeded to act out an impromptu skit about "nose cancer" (don't ask me, it was Kevin's idea).  This basically entailed us running around the 5 or 6 blocks local to my house, with trench coats, spotlights, and airsoft guns, alternately inspecting random vehicles, and pretending to be dead in the middle of the street.  (In retrospect, I'm quite glad some of my paranoid neighbors didn't see us.)    Once we went back inside, things mellowed down a bit, until about half an hour later, when I got the great idea of going on a walk.  Peter and Kevin joined me, and we walked a little over a mile to the Plaid Pantry to get some Henry Wineheart's root beer.  Then, we got the bright idea to go "nutria hunting" on the way back up to the house.  Now picture this - three 16 year old guys walking though a small park, closely encircled with several subdivisions, wearing trench coats, carrying huge spotlights, airsoft guns (which look like real handguns, except under close inspection), and root beer bottles (which look like real beer bottles, except under close inspection), at 6:00 IN THE MORNING, looking for nutria in the water.....  It's a wonder we didn't get caught.  And, once we got all the way back up to my house again, we decided, not to stop, but top go even further, almost the same distance above the house, as we had gone below.  When we finally get back, 2 hours had passed, and we had walked almost 4 miles.  I was one of only three people that slept that night, and I only slept from 9am to 11am.    By 1pm, everyone that was not spending the night the next night had left (everyone except Goody and Andrew).  We were so spaced out by that time, that we spent the rest of the afternoon mostly comatose, watching mindless movies, and playing more HALO.  Goody got to sleep around 11:00pm, and Andrew and I fell asleep, watching a Metallica / San Francisco Symphony Concert.    Zao, Metallica, and Queen are now on my "most downloaded songs list"

      Man, yesterday was  REALLY  cool!  First, we got out of school around 12:00, and my dad pick me up and took me to get a haircut.  We then went shopping for a tie (and decided I would just use one of my dad's instead. - lack of selection).   I went home, took a shower, sat around for an hour or so, had a light snack, and changed into my suit.  My dad then drove me to Gwen's house, where we had a cool conversation with her dad, and occasionally with her mom as she walked through, all the while, vaguely aware of the commotion in other parts of the house as Gwen finished getting ready.  As she came out, my first thought was *man, she looks beautiful*. :) :)  Anyway, we took some pictures there, and had some trouble getting my boutonnire on. :)  And then, *zoom*, down, the highway we went, to the general area of Shenanigan's, and promptly got lost for ten minutes. (as if we weren't already late)   Once we finally got there, we had to walk for a couple minutes to get to the banquet hall.  (Gwen was wearing a rather thin dress, so she was freezing the entire way.)  The masquerade theme was kinda funny, but cool at the same time.  Anyway, we sat down at a table occupied by Missy, Kathleen, and Jalon.  I ordered chicken, and Gwen ordered steak (which turned out to be very rare when she got it - so rare in fact, that she had to send it back to be re-cooked, and half-an-hour later when it arrived again, it was STILL slightly rare).  I would be surprised if at least some of the people that got the steak don't get food poisoning.  Oh well.  The salad was pretty good though.  Later, several more people arrived at our table and royally confused the waiters with all our combined orders. (lol)  After we were done eating we juss walked around for a while, talking to people, and eventually decided to get our pictures taken.  That was an interesting experience - We misunderstood the photographer's question "are you a couple?" to mean 'is there anyone else going to be in this pic', not 'are you dating'.  So, I answered yes, which led to a rather embarrassing situation.  (I'm not going to post what happened, but will tell anyone that asks directly).  Anyway, the rest of the time there was kinda awkward, but still went pretty well.  Then my dad picked us up, and we headed back to my house.  When we got back, we waited around for a couple minutes until Adrian and Melissa came, and then spent a couple hours watching signs.  By the end of the evening, we were all pretty tired, and hyper - an interesting state to be in.  Anyway, they left around 12:25, and I went to bed, and slept for 12 hours. :)

      Yesterday was kinda annoying in an odd way - I woke up an half an hour early, and still made it to school late.  My dad was driving (go figure).  Not much happened at school, but afterward, my mom and I drove all over the retarted city trying to find this one airsoft handgun that everyone carried, but no one had in stock.  It was bugging me that we weren't finding it, but I had kinda suspected that I would have to order it online anyway.  Then that night, right before youthgroup, my parents and I had a big blowup - resulting in my not being able to attend yg.  [may elaborate later ... currently too tired]  This morning, I left school for 2 hours after 2nd period for an orthadontist appointment.  The actual time in the othadontist's office was realitively short, but I didn't really feel like going directly back to school, and my mom didn't care, so we spent a while in an army surplus store checking out different swords and handguns n'stuff.  I was opporating really weirdly when I got back, losing my notebook, and overcoat twice in two hours...  I guess I need more sleep or something...  Oh well, I'm off to do juss that.   O, I am really enjoying cable modem. :)  I downloaded more than 150 songs and music vids in the past week.  I've developed an interesting liking to Good Charlotte, Taking Back Sunday, and AFI.  Currently watching: Days of the Phoenix - AFI

      The 8th was cool.  We ended up, not only taking Gwen and her mom, but Josh, Andy, and one of Andy's sisters too.  For the first production on a new stage, the play was pretty impressive, and the usual beginning technical glitches were just par for the course.  There was one rather humorous time when the lights went up, and the main character was standing on one of the stages.  He looked around, puzzled for a second or two, then quietly walked off the stage.  After the lights took two minutes to dim back off, the audience for some reason started clapping. (lol)  He reappeared a few minutes later with the missing prop - a phone.  One of the scenes was some character's creepy nightmare.  It reminded me kinda of the production  Eternity .  On Saturday, I borrowed a couple guns from Josh for the airsoft war, and got a ride with Liv and Jeremy, who were also taking Steven.  The drive took about one-and-a-half hours.  We got there, played several hours until lunch, then went inside for about half an hour, then went back out again for another solid four hours of shooting each other down.  My dad arrived just as twilight faded, and it became impractical to continue.  Olivia stayed the night at the location we had the war at, and Jeremy, Steven, and I slept on the way back.  :)  We were really tired.  This morning, I woke up an hour late, and almost missed my ride to church.  Gwen and her dad came to first service - that was cool, though she had to leave immediately afterward.  I got the weirdest head ach, and almost fell asleep.  After second service, Steven and I walked over to the Fred Meyer complex to look for Brady, who had taken a different street, and come back at the same time we left.  I was going to go over to his house, but I couldn't contact my parents.  I went home with the Gadaholts and Ben (as usual).  We fired off more potato cannon test booms and later went down to a lake to poach Nutria. (jk) We were thinking about taking the spud cannon and scaring ducks with it though...

      Youthgroup was weird today.  We just moved it over to Tuesday night this week, and the entire Stages (the company that's doing  The Cross and the Switchblade ) crew and cast were in the building doing a final dress rehersal before tomorrow night.  Needless to say, things were hecktic at best.  Gwen didn't seem to mind though (I invited her to the opening play yesterday, and Youthgroup this morning).  Her mom's prolly coming to the play too.  I pushed my annual insanely large slumber party back to the 24th and 25th because a large portion of the people I would be inviting to it were doing stuff this week (including the airsoft war this Saturday, which I'm prolly going to ride with Oliva and Jeremy to).  O, i FINALLY got broadband!!!  (more specifically cable modem)  *is happy*

      Church was cool today, inspite of my sleep (or lack there of) which consited of two hours of tossing and turning the night before.  I just realized that I saw Goody for the first time in like, two weeks today.  After church, I messed around on the stage which is being suddenly transformed into several streets in New York (a backdrop for an upcoming play -  The Cross and the Switchblade , opening next Wednesday).  I spent the afternoon with the Gadaholts and [a really cool guy who's in the Coast Guard, and I can't remember his name for the life of me, but I'll edit this post later with it when I remember it].  We went to Taco Bell, where I made myself mad by continuousely spilling parts of my taco on my trench coat, and then progressed back to their house, with Mrs. Vanhorn (the wife of one of our pastors) and her grandchildren.  We had some fun making very loud booms with Uncle Greg [Gadaholt]'s spud cannon, but eventually put it away in fear of the wrath of the neighbors. :)  I then came back home and started working on backed up homework that I had from before Christmas break, and that's what I'm still doing right now.

      Today was rather uneventful.  I got up, took shower, got dressed, ate breakfast, and sped off to school in the Gadeholt mobile.  Then, I slept through first period, studied through second, grabbed a bite to eat at break, sped through third period, floundered through fourth.  I rethought the meaning of life, and God's purpose for humanity as a whole, while staring at Gwen during lunch.  I breezed through sixth period (lunch counts as fifth), died during seventh, and slept through eighth.  I then spaced out on the bus, daydreamed in one of Farzad's 57 (yes, I am so freaking serious - 57!) cars (a Black VW Beatle) on the way home, and dozed through my piano lesson.    Once I was home for good, I studied the Bible for about 45 minutes, and laid down on my bed for  an hour, contemplating cleaning my room.  Finding little to no pleasure in that, I started to do random work on my computer, and that's about where I am now.  Tomorrow I plan to walk down to Andys house, and spend the day with him and Gwen (well, the day, up until 3:30).  Then, I will possibly drop by Bwittys house, and say hi to her and Jamie.  After which, at about 7:00 everyone from my growth group is coming over for a Bible study.

      Man, I haven't posted for a LONG time... I've been way to busy thinking of excuses for not doing it...  Now that I suddenly realized that my friend Steven has a blog ( urlLink see his blog ) up, it sorta' motivated me to make some changes to mine.  I'll work on a timeline of all the last several weeks, but it won't be up until at least Friday night.  I'm getting ready to go to my church's mid-week service, tonight at 7:00, and am looking forward to it.  Goody's wearing his new combat boots (lol).    Youth Group last night was fun.  I really like the series we're going though right now, concerning evangelism.  Its an area that Im really week in, and I am finding myself wishing we were going to spend more time on it.  I think Stages may finally not be using the building on Tuesday nights from now on, which means we (the youth group) will have the sanctuary to ourselves.  We had a really cool worship chapel today at school.  It's amazing the talent some of my classmates have.  Oh, speaking of school, I woke up at 7:20 today, and had to get to school 1hr and 25 mins late ;)  Well, g2g get ready for tonight. Adios All!~

      I HATE FEVERS!!!!!  I had a bit of a cough on Tuesday, and other than my chronic congestion, I didnt think much of it Then, I woke up at 7:30 am on Wednesday with a splitting headache and a temperature.  I went right back to sleep, and didnt wake up until after 5:45 pm.  I was so dizzy, its not even funny  plus I was feeling sick to my stomach.  Amazingly, I stayed awake until almost 12:00 am.  But, when I woke up today I felt miserable again.  I thought I was doing better around this afternoon, and even told Gwen, when she dropped my homework assignments off, that I would be back in school tomorrow, now though, I know thats not the case.  I hope this doesnt linger into spring break  what with the two-day airsoft war planned and all though, I may not have been able to go anyway because of my chronic congestion.  On Saturday, I spent six hours at the studio working on a show.  It was kind of weird working with the lighting and everything  we had to mask the identity of the person talking throughout the entire show, and it took almost two hours to set up the lighting in the correct fashion.  I went over to the Hakims house afterward, but couldnt stay more than a couple hours because we had guests over at our house.  On Sunday, the 16th, I got a ride to and from Calvary with the Gadaholts, and had lunch with them. Before that, though, we met up with Ryan and Neil Castro (who also came over for lunch) and gave Ben a ride to his house. I spent a couple hours there, watching Christine, Timy and Neil playing some rather hilarious games of foosball, and marveling at the pace at which Ryan reads (though Kathleen can read faster). My parents came and picked me up around 3:00, leaving just enough time for me to get ready to go to Young Hees surprise party, host by Melissa, at 4:30. Not that many people were there compared to a week before (it was me *duh*, Melissa umm *duh* again, Young Hee *I dont like *duh*s anymore, Grace, Adrie, Daniel, Butters, and Gwen (who was working and arrived at 6:45).  I brought my two cameras (one video, one still) at Gwens request  since she would be arriving an hour and 45 minutes after Young Hee, after all. The party was fun until around 5:30, half an hour after Young Hee arrived, when something disturbing happened.  I rather suddenly sank into a huge state of depression - something that had only happened a few times before in my life.  I cheered up a bit again when Gwen arrived, but as soon as we started watching a movie (Rush Hour 2), I started feeling like the whole world was out to get me again.  I dont think I ever want to see that movie again  I downloaded it off the web, and watched the first half hour of it again  with bad results. I didnt start to feel better until about half an hour after the movie finished, and we were playing some random game (Mafia, I think). Its really, really strange looking back on it.  I dont recall much of what happened on Monday  On Tuesday, I went to youth group, only to discover that it will be another two weeks before we (the youth group) can use the sanctuary again  stages just started setting up the set for their next play  Song on the Mountain.  After youth group, I decided to join of group of people (ten, including me), who want to learn more about evangelism, and still act as a sort of support team for each other.   Later that evening, I was talking to someone on im, and found out that I had really offended them at school that day, and I hadn't even realized it... that sort of didnt let me sleep very easily that night.  Then the next day, and today, I was / am sick.  *joy*   uhuh   o, never mind.

      tired..... tired..... tired.....   ... Anyway, I've been running all over the place this last week or so.  Saturday, I painted the inside halls of my school, spent a couple hours at Tualatin Valley Television while some friends of mine were editing footage from a tight retreat that I had to miss cause I had way to much home work.  Then, I went to Melissa's house for her b-day party.  For the first hour or so, until Butters decided to show up, I was the only guy among, like 20 girls at the party. It was cool; we watched a couple movies and played random games for several hours.    Sunday, I went to my parent's church. It was ok.  Monday, I didn't do much out of the ordinary.  Tuesday, I went to youth group. *duh*  Man, Stages wastes no time - they had their last performance of the Cross and the Switchblade on Sat., and by Tuesday, all but a couple tiny parts of the massive set was torn down.  We had worship in the Fellowship Hall cause the on-stage end of the PA system wasn't up yet.  This was the second to the last week that we're going through the evangelism course.  Next week we'll wrap it all up, and the week after, we'll go back to normal yg teaching. After we got out, I spent more than 45 minutes trying to pipe the music from the cd changer through our new digital mixer, into the mains. I finally figured out what setting was wrong and corrected it, right as my dad walked in. lol  Wednesday, Ben came over, just for the sake of coming over (he just started a new trimester, and didnt need help with math).  My mom took us over to midweek, and Uncle Greg gave me a ride back home.  I love midweek  it has an amazing atmosphere to it.  Josh lent his red leather jacket from the play. I wanted to wear it to school on Friday for school spirit day, but it was raining and I opted for a jacket with a hood instead. (Actually, this week was spirit week  Monday was twin day, Tues. was super hero day, Wed. was nerd day, Thurs. was blast from the past day and today was school spirit day.)  After the service, Trevor and I went out back and checked out this tight tiny VW bus.  The thing is like, 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet high. The engine block is in the back, so Trevor and I could easily lift the front half up off the ground.  The entire weight of the thing, including engine block, cant be more than 800 pounds. :)  Thursday, I wanted to help out with a show Pastor Steve was doing at the studio, but I had too much homework. I was talking to Jamie on im, and was planning on dropping in on her and Brittany quickly, but my mom wouldnt let me until after we ate dinner (which turned out to take an hour to make, not 10 minutes).  Then, I called them and said Id try to drop by today, but that didnt work since I was only home long enough to take a shower and head off to my small group tonight.    Today was pi day (3-14), and we had a party in pre Calc.  *yay*  We also had a "pep rally" (if you can call it that...) after last period.  Since our high school student body is only 130-some-odd people, it wasnt that big of a deal.  It mostly consisted of our three basketball teams (girls, guys JV, and guys V) facing each other off in an amazing set of playoffs (well two), using a beach ball-sized ball, with circus music playing in the background.  After school, I got a haircut, ran into Mr. Rivas at Costco, talked to him for around half an hour while waiting for the employees to get me some more contacts, then ran over to Best Buy to get some badly needed RAM.  While there, I spotted a tight AFI cd (Sing the Sorrow) for $6.99, and bought it.  I got home, took a shower, jumped in the car, and promptly tool 45 minutes to get to a destination (my small group) less then 20 miles away  First, my dad misread the directions (I was driving), and we overshot the turn by 2.6 miles Then, he again misread the directions, and we overshot the next turn by 4 miles Then, he misread the directions again, and in the process of turning around, he directed me into a ditch.  All in all, it was quite funny.    Tomorrow, I'm going to help out with a program that Andrews dad is recording, from 2 to 6 pm.  Then, on Sunday, I'm attending a surprise party for one of my upper classmen, at Melissas house again, from 4:30 to 9 pm.  Im prolly going to catch a ride back with Gwen and Adrie, since my parents are going to be at a bible study.

      Well, I'm happy that I made it to youth group tonight. :)  This past week or so, I have been turning the prospect of graduating a year early over in mind, but only today did I really get on the ball and do something about it.  It's a strong possibility, but I would need to accumulate all of my Junior credits during this summer, which means I prolly won't have time to do the ASE apprenticeship thingy... but, I guess you can't win 'em all...  Anyway, the school has a policy preventing people from graduating a year early, so I had to meet with the school board tonight to deliver a thesis on why I want to graduate next year, not the year after.  It took alot less time than I expected (6:45 - 7:30), so I was still able to get to youth group right after worship.    Ben's coming over tomorrow afternoon again, to work on math, and Christine may accompany us as well. Speaking of tomorrow, I really love the new mid-week service.  The atmosphere is amazing.  I especially like the "After Glow" (a period of time after the service - about an hour - where they gradually dim the lights and leave the worship team going as background music and just leave it open for people to pour their hearts out to the Lord.  It's an amazing time.  Yesterday Missy Berdan got back from a month in Africa as a missionary.  Well, it was technically yesterday, but for all practical purposes, it was the day before (1:00am, or somewhere around there...).  She took me home from school that day, and we were talking about her trip, in the car.  She had a really cool time there, and has some interesting stories about it. :)  Well, I am stinking tired, and need sleep.  Will post more about the last couple days, tomorrow. Night all~

      Listening to: El Shaddai - To Him Sits on the Throne Feeling: worshipful, praise filled, slightly tired  I woke up once at 3:00 am, once again at 5:00, and then again at 7:00 and 8:00.  Consequentially, I was really annoyed when I failed to wake up at my alarms designated sounding point (9:30), but rather woke up at 11:45.  I got up, jumped in the shower, grabbed a piece of toast, and walked, in the rain, down to Andys house.  I got there, spent an hour talking to his dad and him about all their high priced computer paraphernalia, and started playing computer games with him (on 2 of his 9 computers upstairs).  We switched over to XBOX when Gwen arrived, and continued on it until half an hour before they left for work at 3:45 (they both work at the same grocery store).   I then walked up to Bwittys house, and talked to her step-dad for a little while before heading further up to our house (Bwitty and/or Jamie were not home).  I made myself some lunch, sat around, and cleaned up the house for around an hour, before heading back down again to see if they were home yet (the time frame her dad had advised). Alas, they werent, so I gave up for the day and headed back.    People from my bible study started to trickle in around 6:45, and everyone had arrived by 7:15.  We spent around 1 hours playing XBOX, eating pizza, and talking, and spent around an hour on studying the Bible. (lol)  I think we need to rethink our priorities when attending this study.  Anyway, everyone was gone by 10:20, and my mom and dad drove me back down to Andys house (he and Gwen had just gotten home from work at 10:00, but sadly, she had to stay home).  He, his dad and I talked more about computers, then played XBOX together.  It was fun.  My parents picked me up at 12:25, and here I am, at my computer, right now   Listening to: El Shaddai - Holy Spirit Medley Feeling: joyful, exuberant, eyes heavy (dumb contacts)

      During youth group this evening, a thunderstorm that had been rolling in for several hours set forth at full force upon us. Corbin, Steven and I ran outside, and walked around for almost ten minutes as the huge raindrops filled the skies and soaked our shirts. (lol) The heat (65 degrees  warm by our standards) and humidity kept us warm, and I felt like I was in the most tranquil spot on earth. Standing there, at the edge of the field around the church, with water pouring down my face, I felt so peaceful; it seemed to me like the rest of the world just melted away for the little bits of time between the awesome flashes of electricity and raw power behind the deafening noise set forth. Then, as we ran around the side of the church, we saw, amidst all this, a double rainbow; a full arc from one end of the sky to the other, shining bright. My, what a stark contrast to the deep black hue that was the thundercloud. I was reminded through this, really just how awesome God's creation is, and through it, how He allows us to get a tiny glimpse at His majesty.

      Man, today was a pretty bad day all around, I guess.  I got up, and got to school on time (which is rare), and lasted through first period, chapel (in which Laura, Gwen and I led the pledges), and most of second, but during first break I was terrible. I have no idea why, but I suddenly felt all this weight upon my shoulders, and lost the will to do really anything. I just wandered around in a semi-daze for a while until third period (English, a class I really enjoy). Then I was fine again, and even happy and stuff, but then fourth (Computer 2); I hate that class with a passion. Don't get me wrong, I love doing anything computer related, but this class bugs the heck out of me for some reason. It's like I can never please the teacher or my peers. They come into it with some weird preconceived notion that I am inferior in all aspects of life, and don't waste any energy trying to contain their opinions. Plus the teaching methods are... intolerable. The teacher doesn't give ANY handouts or guides to ANYTHING (well, I must correct myself, he did give us a total of six, maybe seven sheets of paper this year - mostly pictures of what our projects are supposed to look like.), but makes us rely solely on notes. This would not be so bad if the guy could keep thinking on the same track for more than 26 seconds at a time. He continuously jumps around between topics, then doubles back and corrects himself, then stops to think for a minute, then cant remember what he was trying to say, and so, jumps to another random, entirely unrelated topic. (Does it seem like Im aggravated?)  Ne way, I had lost all resolve to so anything that period, and had just resigned myself to staring blankly at the monitor for the entire 45 minutes.    Lunch wasnt much better. Gwen was in a junior planning meeting for the upcoming retreat, so I couldnt talk to her. (Something I desperately wanted to do  I always, with maybe one exception, cheer up when Im conversing with her.)   Fifth period (typing) was almost as bad as fourth. The only thing I got accomplished in the entire class was a short sorrowful poem that I have yet to complete, name, and post. Sixth (pre-Calc  the hardest math course offered at our school for ones relative knowledge level at entrance) was also really bad. I got a hard test back, and found out I got a 6 out of 14 correct. That pretty much shot the rest of that period. I just laid my head in my arms and tried to shut the world out for a little while, with little success.   Sixth period, however, my mood changed drastically (maybe cause I was finally able to communicate with someone(s). For that class, Gwen sits on my right, and Rachael on my left. I spent all period talking to Rachael about intellectual stuff and to Gwen about how her day was going, and doing tons of work ahead cause I finally got back that derive to work that I had lost all day.   Once I got back home, I could tell immediately that something was at least slightly wrong with my mom. She didnt have that radiant air (spelling?) about her that she usually does around the time that I get home. Later that night, I found out what was wrong at another of our dreaded family meetings: My dad was going on another power trip and had decided sporadically that my mom could no longer be in contact with her best friend, my Aunt Darh-wynn. He was as inanely bull headed about it as he ever is, frustrating me and my sisters beyond measure, and pushing my mom to the brink of tears... again.   Yup, so all in all, today did pretty much suck.  O, and I found out that Gwens working on Sat. from 4-10, so I dunno if the movie idea will work out... So far what I had planned (on planning) to do was invite Gwen, Goody, Diane, Andrew, Cam, Josh and Rachael (Cam and I want her to meet Diane) over to my house, and then go from there to see a movie (most likely the Core, if its still out). But, since Gwen's working, we might end up doing the same thing, minus her, and then visit her later at work. Dunno, Im still thinking about it...

      I have a new theme song. It's  urlLink Charlotte Church - All Love Can Be   I will watch you in the darkness Show you love will see you through When the bad dreams wake you crying  I'll show you all love can do All love can do  I will watch through the night  Hold you in my arms Give you dreams where love will be I will watch through the dark 'Til the morning comes All the light I'll take you through the night to see A light showing us all love can be  I will guard you with my bright wings Stay 'til your heart learns to see  All love can be...

      Well Cameran just left, and I'm bored, so I think I'll catch up a little with my posting. Way back on Friday evening (the 18th), [little] Sam's family and Nadias family came over. 'Twas fun - we hung out and dled a ton of songs. Later, we took some random pictures and sent them to Cameran (who we were IMing).    On Saturday the 19th, around 3:00, we went to Davisons (a really good restaurant) and ate lunch, then went back to my Grandmothers house and had an Easter egg hunt and dessert. We left around 6:30 or 7:00, and [little] Sam came over to my house around 7:15. We messed around for a while, and then drove to Cams house where I was going to spend the night. Sam stayed at his house for around ten minutes until my dad left and took him home. Cam, his little bro. Caleb, and I ran around outside, built a six foot fire in his tiny grill, and jumped around on his trampoline from about 10:00 to 11:30. All this time, we were listening to various head-banger songs (Headstrong, Still Frame, Crawling in the Dark, and others) and talking on phones (me, on my cell, to Gwen, and Cam, on his house line, to Goody). We were trying to convince Goody to come over, but he was to tired and needed sleep before church, the next morning. Cam kept shining my spotlight at passing planes (he lives right by an airport), and we got kinda freaked out when two or three low-flying helicopters started circling the area with spotlights about ten minutes later. Goody (who lives about 8 blocks from Cam) was starting to get edgy too, but then quite suddenly, they just left. I was startled when, about five minutes later, Gwen heard and saw the same helicopters above her house (She lives 8 blocks from me; about 11.4 miles from Cams and Goodys houses) Later, we put the fire out by spraying it with a pressure-washer-velocity hose for 30 seconds, filling the air with little dust particles that got into my contacts, and steam, which cut down vision to about 5 feet. After making our way back to the door, we went inside, ate some really good brownies, and started playing HALO in Cams room. Cam was still talking to Goody, but Gwen had to get off for half an hour. When she called me back, we were still playing HALO, Goody had gotten off, and it was around 12:15. I think we finally stopped talking around 1:30, but beforehand, Cam decided it was to cold in his room. He has a rather interesting way of dealing with this: first he clears off his desk (as much as he can), then he pours about 4 ounces of rubbing alcohol onto it and LIGHTS IT (lol)  He let it burn for a while (prolly 45 seconds total), and believe me, the temperature in the room rose abut three degrees. When we finally decided to go to bed (about 2:15), it was too hot, so he grabbed a huge floor fan from the first floor, and left it running all night. We got into bed at 2:30, but talked for around 2 hours before finally falling asleep.  Sunday the 20th, we woke up at 8:22, 8 minutes before the Rivas were to come pick me up. We rushed to get ready, and actually were by 8:30, but Beth was 10 minutes late, so we didnt have to after all (lol). I didnt eat anything for breakfast except a huge matzah (spelling?) cracker, and nothing at all to drink until after first service. Then, I drank three glasses of tea, a couple of hot chocolate, and a ton of water (and ate several donuts). I found out that Brady lost his eyesight again right after he woke up that morning, but somehow was able to go get to church without his family noticing he showed amazing skill by walking around the fellowship hall, after everyone cleared out, bypassing every obstacle that was normally there, but tripping over things that werent (like feet and backpacks). Later, after second service, he suddenly got his sight back again.  I dont really know what to make of it all, but I do agree with Steven  if I were in his shoes, I wouldnt go walking around like that even if I could, because it just makes people suspicious. Youth church (during second service) was interesting  dont remember anything about it. (lol) After church was out, Goody, Steven, Peter, Brady, Pat and I went across the street to the Fred Meyer complex and found Cam. We hung around for a little while Steven bought more shoes, and Pat bought a huge sandwich (go figure  hes always hungry and hes nowhere near fat must have a really fast metabolism). We then headed back over to church, and Gwen called me. I got into the Gadaholts car, still talking, and we drove back over to Fred Meyer. I got off the phone when we got in, cause I knew we needed to be fast and it was going to take a while (I was exchanging a defective airsoft gun). Indeed I was right  they were really busy, and it took more than fifteen minutes. I called Gwen back once we got back in the car, but it was quite hard to hold a conversation cause of all the ambient noise in the car. Hahahaha *Remembering the Haggis song that Uncle Greg and Timy made up and kept singing*. Gwen could hear me, and everyone else in the car, but I couldnt hear her (I tried, I really did). :)  Ne way, I got off the phone when we got to their house, and proceeded to help make lunch (really good, juicy steaks, mashed potatoes, and apple crisp), and to consume much of it :). I got back home around 5:30, and tried to call Gwen back, but she was at work.   Monday the 21st, I got to school and found out that Gwen was sick.  bummer. I called her later that night for some reason that I cant remember now  Tuesday the (oh, never mind), was really fun! I went to the airport by Cams and Goodys houses for an aviation career day (but, *wah* Gwen was still sick, and couldnt come, and I felt really bad for her). We watched tons of presentations on piloting and ground tech stuff. Then, we went outside on the tarmac for around 45 minutes, and looked at some really sweet small planes and helicopters. The choppers were tight  Lifeflight, cargo, and a couple news choppers. I really want to at least get my private pilot license, and possibly become a CFI (certified flight instructor). When I turn 18, I want to work as ground crew for Southwest Airlines. The pay is decent, but the travel benefits are insane  free travel to anywhere in the continental United States, anytime. I got a ride back to school with Tyler (the only other person from our school to go, other than me and Gwen well, other than me, since Gwen didnt go *wah again*). Before we went back, though, we drove past it, to Wendys and tried to use up as much time as would not be questioned before returning. Later, after school, I brought Gwens homework to her house (I did on Monday too), and later, right before youth group, she called me wondering about a bible test the next day. I was quite thankful she called me, cause I was oblivious to it, since Bibles our first period, and Id skipped first through fifth (out of a total of seven), for the aviation thingy.   I got to youth group about 20 minutes late (no thanks to my parents who wouldnt even let me go at first...). Worship was tight, though I was only there for 2 songs The teaching was... interesting... some really random thing on guy / girl relationships that prolly didnt make sense to the majority of us... Later, afterward, Ben and I holed ourselves up in the control booth, playing Joy Electric, and MXPX, with some really sweet lighting effects for half an hour. It was kinda funny  none else was in the sanctuary the entire time, and we just spent it getting up to speed on each others lives. Bens a really neat guy; its amazing to see how on fire he is for the Lord. :)  Wednesday, Gwen was still sick :( Chapel was cool; dont remember anything else about it at all. (lol) Gwen and I talked at some point before 5:00, when Ben came sloshing up to the door. It was pouring out, and he has walked all the way from the bus stop several miles away (he was wearing wool, so he wasnt cold, just wet. We messed with stuff, and eventually got around to math. My mom took us to midweek around 7:15 (it started at 7:00). Afterward, my mom was more than an hour and 15 minutes late picking me up... really, really, really annoying...  Thursday, Gwen was back! :) We had a test that I kinda out off in Bible... and, well, yeah thats about it - dont remember much more about that day.  Friday, we had a special chapel, and our speaker was a Congressman, or Representative... or something (lol). Plus, it was newly instituted (by the students), Caution Tape Day at school. Everything had some type of Caution, Warning, Danger or Police Line Do Not Cross tape on it. I was wearing a Caution tape neck tie, a Warning sash, and a Caution belt. I called Gwen (or she called me...) after school about something (hehe, Im getting progressively more tired as I write this...).   Growth Group was fun. My small group leader is so tight. Were almost done with the book were studying, and when were finished, were going to have an all-nighter called the Hunt for the Perfect Chalupa (spelling?), which basically entails going to every fast food place open at all hours of the night, doing random things, and videotaping it all. One Idea weve had is bringing David and Ben along, Ben playing a guitar the entire time, and David singing. We would just walk in as a group, and order stuff, all but the two of them, who would follow directly behind us. Then, we would sit down and eat our meals, and leave, with Ben and David serenading us the entire time. Another Idea is to get an even bigger group of people (were 12 strong so far... including Ben and David), and all walking into a Taco Bell, waiting in line as a group, and ordering just one chalupa. Once we got it, the person in the lead would grab it and charge for the door, with the rest of us chasing after him, suddenly yelling the chorus to Hoobastank  Running away.  After growth group, I drove over to Cams house and picked him up. We came back home and spent all night uploading random music files and tweaking them. Finally, at around 2am, we played halo for a little while, then passed out. (lol)  Saturday morning, we didnt really do anything, juss kinda vegged out. Gwen came and picked us up at 3:45, and we rode the mile or so to Adris house with her and her mom. We get there, and Cam faded in and out for a couple hours (he was sooo tired  he kept dropping random things when he was making his sub sandwich), and I was wide awake. When it was time for desert, it turned out to be a massive cookie, not a cake (twas really good). After we sang, people kept going on and on about my voice... which I thought was kinda odd cause I dont really esteem my voice to highly, but whatever. (lol)  Later, we watched Zoolander (a very stupid, gay and perverse movie), and played some HALO on Cams Xbox. One or two of the girls put on Baby got Back, and started dancing to it... slightly disturbing. Butters, Cam, and I (the only guys) kept our eyes firmly fixed on other parts of the room for a couple minutes. (lol)  Gwen had to leave early (like 8 or something). We watched a Knights Tale all the way through, starting at around 9:00 (its a 2 hour movie and  the party officially ended at 10:00, but everyone stayed around for the movie  which was good because Adrie doesnt have a DVD player, and if we left, we would have to take the Xbox with us  oh, and the DVD was Gwens). Another random note about the party: Adris a crazy pyro. Most of my friends and I are pyros to some extent, but we treat it like a science  asking questions like how long can I burn this safely without it exploding? or  how can I take the ingredients in this firework, and turn it into something that will make a really loud noise, without a considerable risk of shrapnel?. Then we answer our question. Adri, though... well, shes just insane about it. She kept chasing people around with candles and lighting things like potato chips on fire. Her mom kept running after her and snapping her with a towel, and she kept lighting thing. (lol...) Then Josh got a towel and started snapping the Adri every time she lit something, so her mom left and did some stuff upstairs. (man that was funny).  Cam and I fell asleep around 1:30 the next morning, and woke up about twenty minutes before we had to leave. We picked up Hamid on the way, and arrived at my parents church about 3 minutes late. I was SOOO tired during the service... I dont want to be rude, but it honestly was more boring than usual. I would just have let myself fall asleep like a most of my friends do (sitting all the way in the back), but I was two rows away from the pastor, so I held out as best as I could.   Later, after service, Cam and I saw Josh again, and I introduced Cam to Rachael. It was so funny... Rachael and I were talking for about 5 minutes when Cam suddenly piped up something to the tune of Man, shes Diane, exactly. That kinda took both of us by surprise, and I asked him what he meant. He launched into a detailed explanation of how Rachaels psyche modeled Dianes and left just kinda standing there, mouths open, wondering how the heck he could figure all that out so fast... He should be a psychiatrist (lol)

      Through this post, I am just basically appending the April 03rd and 19th posts. I think I may have been giving slightly the wrong impression of the situation with Gwen and me as a whole, through my rather emotional outlook on the whole thing. (Warning: arbitrary assertions to follow  standby for possible recall) :) As far as I can tell, Gwen does like me, but shes just not sure of what to do with it much as I am. The whole thing with her asking about dating another person is, in my opinion, completely justified at this point in our relationship. I just think that it surprised me and unnerved me a little when she brought up the question. Keep in mind, also, that these posts were from a viewpoint that has been suppressed for a while  its only natural, in an open forum, to give vent to the feelings that I cannot anywhere else. I may not be necessarily feeling as drastically as I am portraying (then again, I might...), but it makes it easier to figure out what Im feeling myself, by putting my innermost thoughts into writing (and, ironically, laying them bare on a website for all to see).   Btw: on a side note, addressing Stevens post today; You and Cori have known each other pretty well for almost exactly a year long than I have even known Gwen period. Its kinda natural that youd be more comfortable looking at a prospective relationship in the future But, on the other hand, it seems like Gwens looking for a closer relationship sooner in life that Cori is (dating vs. courting), so, I really have no idea. Well, I guess Ill leave you with that to think on for tonight. Sleep well~

      "See, I'm having the time of my life...  Yes, I'm having the time of my life..." wonderful song - can't get it out of my head (lol)  Back on Tuesday (or was it Wednesday...) night, I called Gwen and asked her about the conversation we had almost a two weeks before. (We almost never talk about our relationship and things involved thereof, in person; perhaps because of lack of time... I know from my side at least, there is a slight intimidation factor involved too.)  The ensuing dialogue went something like this: (please note this is not exact, just as correct as I can remember from a couple days later)  Me: Remember that conversation we had about a weekn a half ago, when you were asking me if it was ok if you date other people? Were you thinking of someone, or were you just wondering randomly? Gwen: Ooh how to answer Me: Yeah, Its kinda a tough question for me to ask as well. Gwen: Yeah, it was a tough question for me to ask too [in reference to the conversation 1 weeks ago]... I have another person who, kinda wants to go out with me as well, and I just wanted to know that if I did decided I did want to go out with him... I just wanted to know what point we were at.  Right now, Im just kind of watching both of you, and deciding if I would want to go out with either of you. Me: In a way, Id actually prefer to be in my shoes. Gwen: Haha why? Me: Well, I guess I wouldnt want to have to make a decision. Gwen: Haha, yeah youre juss chillin  We continued talking for another twenty minutes or so, mostly about schoolwork, before getting off. The conversation certainly didnt end as abruptly as the one preceding it, though it left me with more unanswered questions.  I remembered a Biology class, way back around the time of the banquet, when she mentioned offhandedly, that she had actually gotten two invitations to the banquet. Later in the period, she said that it was actually from one of the people in the room with us, but refused to say more, and I didnt push it.  Looking back on that detail, I found myself starting to wonder who the person was, if I knew them, and how to best size up my opposition.  Immediately after, though, I started thinking more along the lines of what true love really entails: is it self serving, or is it putting the other (or others, as the case may be) first?  I really began to think and pray about that for a while, and felt peace that I would be able to cope with it all, either way.  Sure, it would be one of the saddest events in my still young life, after all, she is my first love  and I use that term rather blindly, I still have not come to terms with myself about whether or not I actually am capable of loving her in the truest sense of the word I mean, well theres no question about whether or not Id die for her  Id do it in a heartbeat, but thats just a drastic example, not really capable of weighing the delicate balance between I want a relationship with her because I feel all warm and fuzzy and complete around her, contrasted to I want a relationship with her, but I would rather have what is best for her than what is best for me. i.e. is she wants a relationship with someone else, I would do my absolute best not to stand in their way. Of course this brings up the question of what love actually is: is it a warm fuzzy, self-fulfilling feeling, or is it the complete denial of your own feelings to satisfy the needs of the other?  Im looking back at that paragraph, and realizing that its more just chaotic thoughts that I have written down, and less what Im feeling in general, so Im going to write some main point that probably need re-communication:  I. I am completely and totally unsure if Im ready for a stable relationship yet. II. To the best of my knowledge and my ability to reason, I believe that I truly love Gwen. III. In reference to point I., I have truly no idea how to proceed if she decided that she wants to have a relationship with me. IV. If she does in fact, decide to begin a relationship with the other (currently nameless to me) guy, I will do everything in my power not to stand in her way, including attempting to suppress my feelings for her. (Not that that will be easy, in any way.)  Man, I cant believe that it took me almost an hour to write this relatively short entry. Actually, I can, considering the content.   Well, its already 2:24 a.m., and Id better be getting off to bed.  Since mostly likely Im not going to be able to say this to you in the near future, or maybe even ever, Ill say it now. Gwen, wherever you are (hopefully safe, asleep in bed at this late hour), I love you. Good night.

      Today I went to my parent's church's second service.  Afterward, I stayed for a big banquet they had for Palm Sunday.  I finally got back around 1:30, and got almost immediately on chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire (irc).  Steven was on, and told me about his morning... not the best... at all.  To read more about it, go to  urlLink his blog  .   Yesterday, I fell asleep around 2:30pm, and woke up again around 8:45, when my parents got home, and just walked around, in a daze until around 1:20am, today.   urlLink Mark Schultz - Time Of My Life (my favorite emo song)   He packed his bags when he was just 18 To see a world he thought he'd never seen But he knew when he met her That she was the girl He'd been waiting for  And each night they spent talking on the front porch swing Like it came straight out of a movie scene But one night she stepped out as the sun began to set And when she got to the porch she found a letter that read  You're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  The months went by it was their wedding day A church on a hill, wedding bells rang away She looked like a princess All dressed up in pearls It was her proudest day  And he stood all alone in a darkened church hallway And he got down on his knees and he started to pray He thanked the Lord for his family and the perfect bride But he couldn't hold back what he was feelin' inside And he said  She's the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give her up If I could only stop the world When she's standing by my side See, I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  Forty years went by and she lived most of God's plan She stood alone in an attic, wedding dress in her hand And she held an old letter written so long ago But she'd never forget it No matter how old  And as she turned to put the dress away And pack up the years He was standing in the doorway With his eyes full of tears And he held her  'Cause you're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life

      These are some pics from around 5:00a.m. today:           The beer bottle is actually Henry Weinhards root beer, and the gun is a P90 AEG AirSoft high caliber, low fps bb gun. (will break windows, but not humans)  Yesterday, I left the house at 12:35, drove to Matt's house, dropped my stuff off, and drove to school to meet Mr. Weber and company. We got to the theater around 3:20, with JR griping the entire way about how we were missing the previews :)  The movie, Anger Management, was quite funny, but more than slightly obscene.    After it was over, Weber drove me back to Matts house, where almost everyone was already gathered.  In attendance were, Goody, Matt *umm yeah*, Steven, Brady, Pat, the other Matt, Adam, Jeremy, Josh, Kevin, and me. Kevin had to leave early, cause he had a double header for baseball the next morning.  We got 7(?) computers up and running, and 4 Xboxs, all LANed, naturally.  Over the course of the night, Steven and I called Sam, and talked collectively for around an hour, most of us worked out, and most of us watched at least one of several movies: Signs, The Ring, Phone Booth, the Legend of Drunken Master, AI, and one other. We played HALO (duh), Tribes I / II, Unreal, Counterstrike, Smash Bros., Red Alert I / II, StarCraft, and many other games. I left this morning, at around 11:30, and have been here, dozing, ever since.

      Bored... is what I am... yeah (lol)  Today, Andy, Chris, and I brought our Xboxs (as intended) and played them through fourth period and much of lunch.  It's kinda funny how many people knew about it without the principle catching wind of it (normally even "T-rated" games are restricted from campus, and all we were playing was HALO, rated "M" for Mature).  It was kinda funny - we checked literally every classroom for extra TVs to set up.    All day (and actually, much of this past week...), Gwen and several other girls have been talking about doing something tonight, and little bits of conversation finally eluded to the fact that they were going to see a movie.  It was kinda strange, they would talk about it for several minutes, quite plainly with me hanging around, and never really once even acknowledging the fact that I was there.  Later, in our last period, Gwen and I were talking about movies that are out.  I mentioned  The Core , and she was like, Yeah, I might see that tonight.  After school while I was waiting for the bus, they were getting ready to leave, and a couple of the girls were like Armaan, youre not coming? ...as if they expected me to be.  I juss said that no one invited me, and they left. I was kinda bummed out about that, cause its a movie that I really want to see (of course, the fact that Gwen was going didnt contribute to it at all ;) ).  So, now Im just sitting here home bored (lol)  On a lighter note, Mr. Weber (my Bible, and next year, my Chemistry teacher), and several juniors are going to see Anger Management tomorrow at around 2:00.  Then, Im going to a bday overnighter at Matts house until 11:00a.m. Sat.  (no sleep, much Xbox, etc...).  Steven, Goody, Cam, Brady, Josh, and several others will be there.  Should be quite fun. :)

      I'm finally sitting down to begin another little segment of this monolog... Youth group last night was... interesting... I got there half and hour early (and half an hour late - since I was supposed to be there an hour early for setup). The sound booth was... nonexistent - we had to set it up entirely from scratch. The worship was interesting - tons of tech errors and bugs, and we stopped within ten minutes of starting, cause the worship leader thought God was calling us to pray, instead. So, we got into small groups and prayed for quite a while, and later, broke off into Junior High and Senior High. Almost no sooner than I sat down, I had to get back up again and spend like, 20 minutes tearing the entire control booth down again because Eric (a head techie) needed to set up some huge strobes and spotlights.  I just finally got a scan that I like of the picture of Gwen and me at the winter banquet, and will post it tomorrow night, when I'm coherent enough to remember where I saved it. (lol)

      Man, VBasic must really be getting to us... My computer teacher and I are meticulously going over Steven's blog's coding, trying to figure out how to incorporate an [IF] statement into html.  (lol)  Since almost  of the entire high school student body is gone to D.C. for the week, and our class was only six people strong to begin with... Well, we're juss mostly uploading streaming videos of the war, and debugging random pages off the web. :)  Tomorrow, two people from my class (including me) are bringing XBoxs and Andy is bringing one to Weber's Senior Bible class (same period) so we can have an XBox LAN party over the network.

      Evanescence - Away From Me  I hold my breath as this life starts to take its toll I hide behind a smile as this perfect plan unfolds But oh, God, I feel I've been lied to Lost all faith in the things I have achieved And I  I've woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you (away from this place I have made) Won't you take me away from me  Crawling through this world as disease flows through my veins I look into myself, but my own heart has been changed I can't go on like this I loathe all I've become  I've woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you (away from this place I have made) Won't you take me away from me  Lost in a dying world I reach for something more I have grown so weary of this lie I live  I've woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm longing to be lost in you (away from this place I have made) Won't you take me away from me  I've woken now to find myself In the shadows of all I have created I'm lost in shadows of my own I'm longing to be lost in you Away from me

      I'm currently in typing (right after lunch).   Pressure   There is evil all around us, It surrounds us, It abounds.  I hear the raindrops falling On the ceiling All around.  They tell me to be careful For the sky Is angry now.  Lightning flashes, thunders roars, And all around me, The rain still pours. Down on me.  Down on me, always down,  Never ending, constantly  Tormenting my soul From within and from without, It is tearing up my mind. I'm giving out.

      Another random poem that I thought up in pre-Calc and Biology, today.   Of Fire and Ice   Of fire and ice,  Of wind and rain, Scorching, freezing This molten terrain. I can never comprehend The beauty it reveals, in full,   But I know this much; It appeals to many,  But to none so much As the One who created it all.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain; Destruction and death, Desires profane. I see them augmenting  The beauty here That was displayed within. Hidden for a while  When filled with sin. But this is not the end.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain, Revivals revitalize The hidden, the slain. For in death and destruction,  Life is brought forth To rule and reign ore All the earth. So, unto the end of ages, And onward, still,  He prevails.

      This is not a comunication of my current feeling - at least not so drastically, its just a random poem I wrote moments ago...  COMFORT  Of all sadness there is none like this Far from bliss or happiness The world all around is closing in Turn around and see  It will never be the same again All anguish and sorrow and grief  Fall upon me as I try to leaf Through this book called the Pages of My Life  Necessity befalls me to throw on my burden Bear it as light, And amidst it all, prepare to fight or flee This coming darkness The true flame That again, shall imprison me. As I begin to burn, you need not think Of sorrow or grief, amidst the roar  For comfort this flame brings Compared to the pain felt before.  Good Night

      I'm going to copy a post from  urlLink Olivia's Blog  that I think was wonderfully written:  Wednesday, March 26, 2003   Have you ever wondered about love? What does it really mean...how do you know if you are in love...the different types and kinds of love...ever wondered these kinds of things? Love is such a complex and amazing thing! Well, it would be, for God is love, and who can comprehend God?   What about the love between to people of the opposite gender? Usually we think of adults, right? It seems to me that teenagers aren't really expected to fall in love. They are supposed to have crushes, flirt, fool around, wish for love, but never actually fall in love. Is this true? Maybe its just a mindset...we've been conditioned to think that we cannot fall in love because we are too young, inexperienced, and immature. Maybe we are just as apt to fall in real love as the ones 10 and 20 and more years older than us.  But how do we know if it is love? How do we discern whether or not it is just a crush, or that we have convinced ourselves to care for someone because we were told they cared for us? How can we know? Are we just the same as those who are older than us? Do they know what falling in love is supposed to be like? Are we all in the same boat?   What are we supposed to do if we think we're in love? It seems that the difference between a simple crush and love is that, besides other factors, if you love someone, you want to care for them, and show them that you love them, and tell them. It is deep...but with a crush, its simply based on lust in one form or another, and you want to keep it secret from that person that you like.   Its so confusing, and complex. Somebody has to tell us how it goes... We only have to wait on God, I suppose. May he tell us quickly.   - Liv, 10:06 PM

      Ah, the dating game  its a flawed concept to begin with; falling in love, being in love, backstabbing, floundering after breaking up, and repeating it all over again, but its also predominantly fun.    Think Im being double minded? Well, youre right, I am. Thats cause I still havent really come to terms with myself in conjunction with the whole issue yet.  Point in question: Gwen and I.  Late last year she started hanging around me more, and I, being of the masculine gender (i.e. dumb, adj. Conspicuously unintelligent; see stupid), failed to take notice of it for a while.  When it finally clicked *duhum.. I tink purty gurl likez mee*, I started spending more time around her too. We eventually started doing random stuff together outside of school (movies, having lunch together, bringing her to my youth group several times) and some people started arbitrarily labeling us as dating, though I didnt think we were and I think (hope wonder whatever) that she didnt either.  Winter Banquet (see my archives  January 18th) was fun, and we both had a good time. Her dad wanted to meet me first before I took her, so I had lunch at her house back in December, and he and I talked for a while.  I thought it was cool that he cared enough about her to do that, and I started to get to know him (hes a nice guy), but the general feeling I was getting from Gwen was that she was embarrassed about the whole thing.  (Haha  I probably would be too, in her shoes).  We continued doing random things together into February, though in the last month or so weve been starting to get a little distant. Shes constantly to busy to come to youth group, and we havent done anything together by ourselves at all except a U.S. History project that we worked on together. (She taught me how to sew! *yay!* Well, sorta  Im terrible at it *lol*)   Ive also noticed that Ive been acting kinda weird with the whole situation too  the most predominant instance that I can think of right now, was back on March 16th, at Melissas house.  We had just turned on a movie, and I was one of the first people to sit down.  I was just expecting, by default, that Gwen would want to sit beside me, but instead, she went over to another part of the room and sat beside Butters, who had been acting overtly flirtatious the entire night (I later found out that he was on some type of pain medication, and didnt even remember the majority of that night.). It may have been the fact that I was depressed to begin with, or it may have be the fact that I noticed Butters holding her hand for a while (or both), but whatever the reason, I just decided it was easier to not worry about it. So I just spaced out for a while, in fact, the only parts that I remember from that point until the end of the movie were several times when Gwen was trying playfully to get Butters not to watch the screen during some supposedly bad parts. (I wouldnt know whether they were actually bad or not  I wasnt exactly coherent.) Anyway, a while after the movie was done, Gwen came over and asked if I was okay, and rubbed my back for a second. I replied yes (lie) so she wouldnt worry about it. She didnt, and I forced myself to cheer up and actually did have a good time for the rest of the party.   In the car on the way home Adrie (her parents were taking both me and Gwen home) asked us if we were officially going out yet, or what the nature of our relationship was. We all talked for a little while, and arrived at the conclusion that we were not dating, but that we (Gwen and I) should talk more about the subject later. We did on im the next Tuesday:  Me: hey I've been thinking a lot over the past couple days about that   rather brief conversation we had in Adrie's car the other day... Me: and I was wondering something Me: how do you see our relationship in terms of what you would want it to be?  i.e. do you like it the way it is right now? Me: sorry, that was kinda out of the blue... Gwen: right now it may be best to get to know each other as friends rather than go into an unstable relationship at this time.  Me: o good Me: I was hoping you were thinking along those lines Me: that's exactly how I have been feeling Gwen: thought so  What was the point of all this?  Well, in our last period class today, she randomly said she needed to talk to me tonight.  I though that probably didnt mean something good, and was correct.  At 7:17, she called my cell, and we had around a five minute conversation. She made reference to the conversation above and asked if that meant I was okay with her dating another guy. I told her that there should be no true reason why I couldnt adjust to it over time, but that I would be rather disheartened at first. She asked why, and I answered because I had hoped that we were heading for a closer relationship in the near future. We sorta ended on that note, her saying that shed let me get back to my homework, and me saying that Id see her tomorrow.    Now re-read the first two paragraphs of this post and youll see kinda what I mean  Listening to: Saliva  Always (ironically the song that Andy and I kept listening to, to and from a field trip to Oregon City this morning) Feeling:  umm lol, read the lyrics - listen to the song - whatever   urlLink  Saliva - Always     I hear... a voice say "Don't be so blind"...  it's telling me all these things...  that you would probably hide...  am I... your one and only desire...  am I the reason you breathe...  or am I the reason you cry...

I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I feel... like you don't want me around...  I guess i'll pack all my things...  I guess i'll see you around...  Its all... been bottled up until now...  as I walk out your door...  all I hear is the sound...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...

The night is still young - I have much to do.

      My family is dysfunctional.   Ok, Ill elaborate If youre reading this blog, chances are you know what Im taking about, but Ill overview it anyway.  Without going into a large amount of detail (which, I would estimate, would take several hundred pages to write, or several days to dictate orally), I will try to explain as best I can some more recent events.  Ive always viewed my dad as an angry person, from as far back as some of my earliest memories, but these last nine months or so have revealed just how deep that anger problem went.  There was a time, at the end of last summer, when my mom was in tears at LEAST two times a day, for almost a month on end (this was all from verbal abuse from my dad).  To cut a very long monolog short, the pinnacle of evidence of my dads anger came about a week or two before Christmas last year.  (My family situation was so bad throughout December, that I skipped celebrating my birthday, the 18th, until late January.)  It was at that time that his problem finally came out into the open, and they started going to marriage counseling.  It has had a drastic difference, I can tell, and Im quite proud of him because of it, but it hasnt come without its own share of problems.  For instance, one thing that we have started to do is have formal family meetings to try to create a stable forum for communication (something that we have never had before).  The first several had their share of hitches, but were predominantly effective.  Not so with this last one.  We had a meeting today starting about 9:25, and expected to last one hour.  Within the first five minutes, however we launched into a trivial argument that I exited 25 minutes later by excusing myself from the table, and amid my dad yelling how terrible a child I was being, and demanding that I come back down and sit at my place at the table before he counted to three.  (Its almost comical, actually, if you dont take into account my two crying sisters, my sullen mom, and the fact that now he wont let me go to a play tomorrow night because of my being stubborn and rebellious.)  Make no mistake, it wasnt just my dads fault, my mom was the one who started the argument in the first place, and the one that was being the most controlling.    Other than this wonderful development, my day has been relatively uneventful.  My Spring Break was quite fun. On Monday, Steven came over around noon, and went to Butters house with me from 4:00 to around 11:30.  The Neff troop, Gwen, Adrie, and a couple other people were there.  It was kinda interesting the first hour or so  we were all tired, and for some reason we decided to go up t the Gadeholts house, and bother Kat and Timy several times.  Twas funny.  We watched LotR, cracking Gandalf the Gay jokes all night long, even while were watching the Patriot later.  We went to a park around 10:30, and had fun running around in the dark (at least I think we had fun) lol.  Steven and I stayed up till around 4:00am that night (morning?) and woke up around 9 the next day. :)  We went to a really cool piano shop, and saw / played some really really top-of-the-line pianos, and learned interesting, but relatively useless info about them (like, did you know that all the string combined exert more than 20 tons of force on the inside of a piano?)  Later that night we went to youth group, and Steven went back to his house afterward.   Wednesday, at 5:00, I hosted a large xbox lan party.  In attendance were Pat, Steven, Andy, Andrew, Brady, Goody, David, Mark (I hope thats his name lol), and Cameran. We debated going out and throwing rocks at windows of friends residing nearby at pre-dawn hours, but nothing came of it.  Everyone was gone by 4:00 Thursday, and I decided I needed sleep, but didnt get much.  On Friday, Brady, Cori, and Mrs. Lee picked me up at around 2:00, and then we went and acquired Cameran from his abode.  I dont remember much about Friday afternoon (but thats okay cause I videotaped a large amount of it), on account of sleep deprivation.  I do recall playing HALO for quite a while though, and eating some really rich chocolate cake that Cori brought back from her growth group.  Cori finally went to bed past 1:30 (she had work at 8:00 the next morning), and Cam, Brady and I ran around for a while, outside.  We kept going outside, and making random videos involving little dancing chipmunks, and alternately going back inside and watching random movies (including the Princess Diaries, and some Ernest movies, before we got scared by what we thought was a cougar.  At around 5:00, we went back outside and repaired a tree house.  I think we sat around bored for an hour after that, then woke Cori up at 6:30 and showed her some of the footage of us being weird that we took over the night.  (lol)  She left at 7:30, and we started riding a go-cart around. Including a break for lunch (really good homemade pizza), we ended up riding that go-cart for more than 6 hours, and we had to refill it twice.  I was so stinking tired on the way home, I couldnt think, like at all.  Cori, Mrs. Lee, and I were discussing conspiracy theories, and I had to really concentrate to even comprehend what they were saying.  Quite funny.  I got back to my house around 6:30, walked around in a daze for ten minutes, went up to my room, closed the door, turned on the tv (the stereo, computer, and lights were already on), laid down the wrong direction on my bed, woke up 12 hours later, changed, brushed my teeth, took off my glasses (lol), and finally got in bed.  Sunday, I went to my parents church, and hung out with my Grandma and sisters all afternoon.    Monday  nothing substantial  Tuesday, we had guests over, and I got to youth group almost half an hour late. So late, in fact, that I just stayed in the Sanctuary, and watched Stages' final dress rehearsal before the debut of Song on the Mountain tomorrow.  Today, I went to the dentist after school, and Ben came over late. Later, I missed midweek, so I could be part of the wonderful family meeting, and thats about where I am now.   This was finished at 10:13, but I have been hindered from posting it until now.

      Ok, this post is going to be really random, cause I'm just writing it sporadically while skipping study hall, 5th period.  On Monday, my mom took Gwen and me to the library to get some books for a small report due on Tues. on the way back home, we stopped at several animal hospitals to post lost cat signs - one of our two cats has been gone for a week. :(  Afterward, we stopped at Subway to grab some... well subs. (lol) Oh, haha the couple times we had gotten into the car before Subway, my mom kept reminding me to open the door for Gwen... trouble was, I wasn't sure where she wanted to sit, so I opened the wrong door. :) Then, when my mom drove up to the Subway to pick us up, I looked at Gwen and marched up to the door acting all *pompous* and *gentlemen-like*, and the door was locked! (She was still laughing about that at lunch this afternoon. ;)  Youth group was fun last night. Jamie was there! - First time I've seen her in almost a year:)... now if we could only get Bwitty back... (Lol)  o.O Gwen was there too finally :):) I did the overheads for worship, and the laptop kept freezing up! So annoying... 'Ne way, the Senior High youth leaders were gone on vacation, so my small group leader taught. It was basically an open forum for discussing topics that he brought up. After youth group, we stopped at Arbies on the way back home. My mom stayed in the car, and Gwen and I went in to buy milkshakes... dang the guy behind the counter was really tired. :) Interesting experience.  I'm talking to our SBP, Jason at the other end of the room... he's been living a really fast paced schedule  this school year.  Btw, my cable modem is screwed up, so I won't post anything for a little while except from school.

      Two of the most touching songs in my life right now (and, most likely, of all the student body at my school):     Breathe     This is the air I breathe  This is the air I breathe  Your holy presence  Living in me   This is my daily bread  This is my daily bread  Your very word  Spoken to me   And I............. I'm desperate for You. And I............. I'm lost without You.          Surrender - Marc James     I'm giving You my heart and all that is within I lay it down for the sake of You my King I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You   I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross And all the world holds dear I count it all as loss For the sake of knowing You For the glory of Your name To know the lasting joy Even sharing in Your pain   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You

      Amazing...  Yup, thats the only way to describe it  These last two days have made a change in my life that I hope I will never forget.   Yesterday, we met at the high school campus at just before 8 oclock. We left shortly there after, and I spent the bus ride (about 1 hours) sitting beside Gwen, playing badgamen (spelling?), and several different types of card games for the majority of the time. We got to the camp, unloaded our stuff, and walked out onto the beach (not just the two of us, for thats against school rules *lol*), and recorded random people doing random things (I brought my camcorder  *yay*). I had to go help serve lunch pretty much right away, so I headed back to the cafeteria in around 20 minutes while Gwen and Lisa (her best friend at school) walked all the way out a huge rock about  to  a mile up the shoreline that everyones taken to congregating at. I attempted to help out but they already had enough sophomore volunteers (the sophomores were in charge of serving lunch), so I tried to get to the back of the line. For some reason, one of the staff members of the camp told me not to go all the way around, but to just get into line right there, so I was the third person out of 145 (approx.) to get food *lol*. After we were done eating, we all headed across the small field / play structure / basketball court to the chapel hall.   Ok, hands down, I was not prepared for that chapel. I am usually a fairly introverted person when it comes to things like raising my hands when singing, and for that matter, even singing with my full voice: but not so yesterday and today... I was totally into the worship, and wasnt at all apprehensive about letting the whole room know it. (The awesome thing about it is that basically everyone in the room was acting the same way too, pretty out of character for my school.)  After a brief message from ...some people... (I dont remember who), we headed out for what was supposed to be organized games outside, but the constant shifting every hour from a 60 torrential downpour, to 82 blazing (relatively) sun kinda put a damper on that idea. Instead, people broke off into a several big groups, two of which went out and played the traditional beach football and walked to the rock again, respectively. I was in the rock group. Everyone messed around for a while, while I recorded their antics (Butters trying to throw huge sticks... or small logs... at a rock ledge more that 80 feet away, Trevor getting pelted with huge dirt clods, and people juss generally having a good time.) Oh, Gwen got a really cool picture on her camera of Grace, Young Hee, Butters and me, positioned in such a was on the rock that it looked like Young Hee and I were standing in Graces hand, and Butters, in mine.  Close to 4:30, the juniors, of whom Gwen is one, went back to the cafeteria to set up the decorations for the traditional mystery dinner, which turned out to be, not a 70s theme, but an 80s prom theme... but Ill get to that in a minute... Ne way, I was trailing behind Danielle and Gwen, who had made off with my jacket, and run a considerable length down the beach, back toward camp. As I was attempting to get my cameras in order and run to catch up to them (something they were trying to prevent by looking back frequently and running forward a little when I got too close), and something suddenly distracted me. Completely forgetting about requiring my possession, I veered left, up onto a sand dune, and sat down and started praying and singing.  I was doing this for a while (prolly close to ten minutes), before Gwen noticed I wasnt trailing them anymore, and came looking for me. (I found out later that she thought I was sad or distressed about something by the way I was sitting, from a distance... hehe :) far from it - God is amazing.) She gave me back the jacket, and I just stayed there for another several minutes before the next wave of my peers came walking back from the rock. I got up and joined them, and several of us (Trevor, Butters, another freshman and I) grabbed part of Butters stack of explosives and combustibles, and set some stuff on fire over by a little rivers outlet into the ocean.  Later, most of the guys in our little rock group went back to the massive sophomore / junior guy's cabin (actually a converted gathering hall), and watched my video up to that point, and listened to cds for quite a while. Then, we went to the senior cabins and watched the senior guys punch each other until they blacked out. ...umm... smart... yeah...  The dinner was fun. We all got into two lines outside of the cafeteria: girls on the right, boys on the left, with seniors in the front, sophomores in the middle, and freshmen in the back. When the juniors opened the doors, we realized that members of the opposite gender were going seat us individually. Secretly I was hoping that by some ironic Devine calculation, the lines would match up and Gwen would seat me, but no, when I walked into the door of the banquette hall, my arm was draped through Alis, not Gwens (whatever... it was for like, five seconds anyway *lol*).  The skit if you will was based on a prom, complete with the crowning of seniors for different things. Later when we were eating, Gwen came over to our table and danced a little to the 80s music filling the room. Hehe, I got a picture of her in the light blue green dress and that *cute* little pigtail or whatever that she was wearing off to the side of her hair.   Later, we had another chapel that was really my highlight of the trip. You could almost feel the Spirit of Christ flowing through the room as a tangible entity... I was completely broken down at one point, kneeling before the alter, with my face on the ground, weeping, crying out to God, begging Him to lift this burden of thoughts and deeds off my back. As I was singing again, I felt a sudden peace rush over me, and a wonderful feeling of ease and comfort and the knowledge that God was there to help me (Me, o wretched sinner that I am... to think that Hed love me... I cannot even begin to fathom it.). As soon as this happened, I couldnt stop thanking God, it was like I literally couldnt stop. I gave no heed to what was going on around me; singing or praying or both, I dont remember, but I just kept praising God under my breathe for what seemed like seconds, but Gwen told me later that it was quite a while.   I cant remember right now exactly when our Student-Body-Presidents sermon was, in relation to the worship, but it was really cool. He was talking about how Jesus has called us individually to Him, and how His word should he like honey to our eyes. We should treat it as such  hungering and thirsting for it as we do for our physical food. He had a couple honey jars (jugs, pots, little plastic things that you squeeze?) passed around the room, and we were supposed to put a drop on our finger and lick it off when he said too. The illustration behind this was another illustration - apparently when young Jewish children would start to memorize the Torah (at age 5 or 6 or something...) the Rabbis would coat their slates in honey to represent physically, what we should think about what it teaches us spiritually.  Once he was done, we continued worshiping till around 11:30, and broke off the get some snacks and other things, the go to bed. I was still in a daze from the singing, and just got out the door, closed my eyes, and walked, thinking about the night. Next thing I know, I was at the base of the massive sand dune that borders the beach. I walked up it and just gazed at the water for a time, then headed back to my cabin, then to the cafeteria to grab some apples, then back into the fellowship room to grab all the stuff I left in there, then said goodnight to Gwen, and headed back to out mega cabin.   I finally got to sleep about on 1 hours later, when we duct taped Alexs mouth shut, and his hands and feet together.  I woke up at 6:30, got up, got dressed, and headed over the cafeteria for Chi Alpha (the schools bible study that usually meets on Thursday mornings). Once that was over, I ate breakfast, went for a run on the beach, and made a trip back to our cabin. Once I got back to the cafeteria, I immediately noticed that Gwen was  finally  up (well, she has an excuse  she took a shower). We got over to the chapel, where we spent not 1 as originally intended, but three hours, during which, we had even more worship, and this really tight bus drive named Roland played his harmonica with the band.  Then we made the speediest exit in Faith Bible history (after the longest chapel in Faith Bible history, on a retreat with the least amount of people not there in Faith Bible history), packing, taking pictures on the sand dune, cleaning the cabins, loading the U-Haul, and boarding the buses all in under 25 minutes.  Once we were clear of Wi-Ne-Ma soil, we headed north several miles to Tillamook, home of the Tillamook Cheese Factory. We at lunch in the Factory (which is actually a museum of cheese, and once again, I found it funny that we completely overran the place with Faith Kids. :)   Hehe, I got some good pictures of Gwen, with sunglasses on, sticking her tongue full of ice cream, out at the video camera.  On the bus ride home, I sat beside Gwen again, playing more card games and other random things. Oh, Butters and Josiah were on one of the other busses (there were four total), and we made use of my and Josiahs FRS radios to talk to each other the entire way home.   ________________________________________________________    Something offhand that stood out to me was a comment that Gwen made on the bus on the way back home: Adam was really tired, and was sitting in the isle beside Gwen, resting his head on her leg. She had been bending down rubbing his hair and massaging his back for quite a while, and she randomly looked up at me and said something along the lines of: Armaan, dont get jealous, Ive massaged your back too before. She meant it in jest, I know, and, if I remember correctly, she was also wrong  she hasnt given me a backrub before (...well, except at Young Hees party, but that was only enough time for her to ask me if I was ok, and me to lie in response that I was). But, no matter whether she was right or not, it got me thinking about us over the last day or so. Id hugged her three times in less than an hour (and we never hug  we may have done it six times since weve known each other), and throughout the retreat, she had been acting affectionate toward other guys (mostly comforting them during worship), and now she was giving Adam a backrub. ...ok anyway... the point Im trying to make is this: There was that retarded micro paranoia of mine about showing physical affection toward her that I think I might have suddenly gotten over, and then there was that stupid territorial mentality that had been keeping me distant whenever she was interacting a large amount with other guys, that God, I think, helped me through too.   Oh, one other slightly insightful random thing that I wanted to mention: When I got into the chapel this morning, I was looking around for a little while, and couldnt find Gwen, so I sat down in the back row like wed been doing before. Lisa noticed me sitting back there, by myself, and invited me to sit with her and Adam, so I switched spots to sit there. Then, looking around the room from my new vantage point, I spotted Gwen, but she already had Josh (a senior) and Young Hee sitting beside her. I juss assumed that she didnt want to sit by me, like sometimes happens in the chapels at school, so didnt do anything. Later though, after chapel she acting indignant - almost annoyed that I didnt sit beside her. That was kinda the first direct indication Id gotten in a while that she wasnt just putting up with me sitting next to her all the time, but that she actually wanted me too, so that sorta made my day slightly happier (how it got happier from what it was, I do not know... maybe happy is relative - you can always have more... hmmm must ponder that.  On a similar note, I had a great time at Gwens youth group on Wednesday. I met Kevin and we seemed to hit it off without a problem (at least I like him...). *lol* I also met several other of Gwens friends, one of whom offered me a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and another, slightly quirkier one, who seemed to have a controversial opinion on... well, everything (lol). I prolly wasnt helping much though, since I was so tired, and would say stupid things that would egg her on. Worship was sweet, and the teaching was tight. We watched two video clips: part of some REALLY random movie, and part of Braveheart. Her mom came to pick us up, and as we left, I waved to Kevin, and he waved back, smiling.  Funny, even I, in all my optimism, didnt think the night would end that way. (Well actually, it didnt end there  Gwen still had to ask her mom if I could come over and help her make brownies, her mom still had to say that she was too tired and take me home, and Gwen still had to come in for a couple minutes and say hi to my mom before she could leave, and the night would really be over) *lol*   Ok, Im really dizzy for lack of sleep, and even though this says that Im posting on Friday, I added a ton of stuff, and finished at 2:16 a.m. Saturday.

      I just found out that Im going to Gwens youth group tonight, and that that one other guy (...Kevin? lol, I cant remember) is going to be there. Gwens slightly worried that were going to be at each others throats all night, but I actually want to meet him. Whatever... Well see how it goes...  Josh, Trevor, Derek and I are getting together at Trevors house to construct some... *pop*ers for the retreat tomorrow. Oh, I tested the air horn last night at youth group: vewwie vewwie loud. :):)

      Some random quotes from an email that Brianna sent me:  "You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is beautiful because you love her." -Unknown "If you love somebody, let them go. If they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were." -Unknown "Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get, it's what you are expected to give -- which is everything." -Unknown "We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together." -La Bruyere "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain." -Leo Buscaglia "Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "All thoughts, all passions, all delights Whatever stirs this mortal frame All are but ministers of Love And feed His sacred flame." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never." -Charles Caleb Colton "Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love says 'I need you because I love you.'" -Erich Fromm "Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so." -David Grayson "At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet." -Plato  These two are powerful: "Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enkindles the great." -Comte DeBussy-Rabutin "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." -Mother Theresa

      O.o  I love that song that Steven posted on  urlLink his blog     urlLink Blessed Union Of Souls - Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me For Me)   She don't care about my car  She don't care about my money  And that's real good because I don't got alot to spend  But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin'   She likes me for me  Not because I look like Tyson Beckford  With the charm of Robert Redford  Oozing out my ears  But what she sees  Are my faults and indecisions  My insecure conditions  And the tears upon the pillow that I shed   She don't care about my big screen  Or my collection of DVD's  Things like that just never mattered much to her  Plus she don't watch to much t.v.   And she don't care that I can fly her  To places she ain't never been  But if she really wants to go  I think deep down she knows that  All she has to say is when   She likes me for me  Not because I hang with Leonardo  Or that guy who played in "Fargo"  I think his name is Steve  She's the one for me  And I just can't live without her  My arms belong around her  And I'm so glad I found her once again   And I'm so glad I found her once again  And I'm so glad I found her once again  Gazing at the ceiling  as we entertain our feelings in the dark  The things that we're afraid of are gonna show us  what we're made of in the end   She likes me for me  Not because I sing like Pavarotti  Or because I am such a hottie  I like her for her  Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford  She has got so much to offer  Why does she waste all her time with me  There must be something there that I don't see   She likes me for me  Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy  Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey  Unlike the Cable Guy  But what she sees  Is that I can't live without her  My arms belong around her  And I'm so glad I found her once again  Found her once again  I'm so glad I found her once again  On again

      Listening to: Chevelle - Closure. Feeling: apathetic, slightly bored, ineffectual.  I woke up the first time around 7:10 this morning and drifted in and out of consciousness for around 2 hours, and finally got up when my dad got back home from a meeting.  He took me out to get a haircut for my schools upcoming retreat to Wi-Ne-Ma on the beach. I got home around 11:30, took a shower, ate lunch, and headed back out the door for a piano recital. I came into that fairly unprepared, but surprised myself by doing a better job than I thought I would. I got back here about half an hour ago, and immediately got into Youthfire Chat (chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire, or  urlLink here  for all those people out there without an IRC client). I'm signed in for about  of every day as The_Fire_Breathes.  Let me see here... *sits back and tries to recall the events of the last week or so...   The trip to Wi-Ne-Ma is next Thursday and Friday. For both the trips per year, one of the upper classes hosts the dinner on Thursday night. The fall on is the seniors, The Spring one (this next one) is the juniors.  It was quite funny last year: I was only taking two classes, and naturally, I wasnt as up on the proceedings of the school as everyone else was, plus a lot of people didnt know me. So, when I wandered into the meeting room that the juniors were setting up, no one questioned me, and I had no reason to assume that I wasnt supposed to be there. I just hung out the entire time that they were setting up, and it took me until after all the other classes were formally ushered in, to realize that I wasnt supposed to be there :)  Anyway, the juniors have been confining themselves into one classroom during lunch, more often than not over the last three weeks, and Im really interested in what theyre going to have set up.  Josh and I might make a Piccolo-Pete bomb and bring it, but we dont know yet... I got a new 1,000,000 candle power spotlight on top of the other identical one, and the 3,000,000 candle power one that I already have. I might get a 6 cell MagLite, and high intensity LED headset before then too. Oh, yeah... back to pyrotechnics... modded lighters, WD-40, small street firecrackers, and possibly some air horns (not really pyrotechnical, but theyre still stinkin fun).  Student council elections were several days ago, and I wanted to run, but I decided not too since I still wasnt sure if I was going to be a junior or senior next year. (I have finally decided to take a huge burden off my shoulders over the summer by not graduating a year early, but I didnt decide until two days after the elections.) Im going to hate myself throughout the entirety of this upcoming school year, for that decision, but I think its for the better in the long run.

      Whats been going on over the past week? Hmm I think Ill start with the more recent events that I remember more about.  1. Gwens on a several-week long mission trip up to a Native American reservation up in a southern province of Canada with her church. She left around 6:00 am, Friday morning, and is getting back mid-July. I was hoping to spend a while talking to her on Thursday night, but it didnt work too well: My dad had previously decided that if my room wasnt clean in the morning, I would have to forfeit phone usage that evening. That was... kinda fine with me, but thats beside the point. I had told him the night before, that even if my room wasnt clean, I still wanted to use the phone because it would be the last time Id be able to talk to Gwen in three weeks. He agreed, but I eventually did get time to clean my room anyway. The next morning, he said it looked clean, but it could use a little more work later. Then, that evening, about ten minutes after Gwen called me, he yelled down at me from the landing above our office to get off the phone and that he had told me not to be on it. I tried to call up to him that that wasnt what he had communicated to me several times beforehand, but he wouldnt listen He kept telling me simply to get off and not use it again the entire night, and when I would ask him why he would just reply by yelling louder at me. I started yelling back at him and this went on and on for a while, until he just turned around and slammed the door behind him as he stomped into his room. I realize now that I prolly shouldnt have been yelling back at him, especially with Gwen on the phone still, and I need to apologize to her when I talk to her again. Anyway, she and I resumed talking again, but less than ten minutes later, he picked up his phone and demanded why I was still on: launching into this entire campaign about how rebellious I was being and that we had agreed that this was a punishment for not keeping my room clean (something we have, in fact not done) and just generally going on and on about how bad I was. Finally I convinced him that I was going to get off and he hung up. Not more than two seconds later though, he picked up the phone again and started yelling at me again that I wasnt off yet and that he needed to use the phone. After a little while, he got off again and Gwen and I said a rather awkward goodbye, and that was it. Well, thats my dad for yah.  2. I went JETSKIING all day Saturday with my uncle. :) :)  I got up around 8:00 to be ready to go by 9:30, but my mom randomly came up with an hour-an-a-half worth or work to do before I could go (vacuuming the entire house and such), so we actually got going around 11. We walked around downtown and went back to his house where we listened to some Red Hot Chili Peppers on his 15 grand high end stereo system (fricken purest tone Ive ever heard from a recording). Later, we met up with his girlfriends family on the Columbia River and enjoyed a LONG afternoon from 1 till past 9 of jetskiing and wonderful Russian fish and stuff. (her familys all Russian). After sundown, the river (more than a mile wide) was sooo calm. We could push 50mph for an easy 2 mile stretch without getting bumped around too much.   3. I went to Camerans house after church with Steven and Brady today (well, now actually yesterday). We mostly juss hung out, swam, played Halo and jumped on his trampoline. Twas quite fun. Toward 8 or so, we walked (me and Steven barefoot) over to my best friend, Goodys house and sat around outside for like twenty minutes and walked back. Later, my mom and my aunt picked me and Steven up and took us to home after Taco Bell. We were talking about this one abuse support group that Steven and I are thinking about joining, and Im finding myself more interested in it day by day. Whatever well see what comes of it Oh yeah, and there was some huge issue that went on at home today again, that basically necessitated my mom leaving and hiding out somewhere from right after church (like 1-ish) till when we finally got back home (like 11:00). Man, I wish more than anything that my family problems would just disappear and that wed be a normal healthy family, but I dont ever even see that as a possibility until way way after Ive moved out. It saddens me.  Goodnight all, and sleep well. (especially Gwen)

      You know, in looking back on this past school year with Gwen, Ive come to the rather stark realization of how strangle Ive acted when at school. Let me preclude this by saying that these last 12 months have been the most stressful in my entire life. Bearing that in mind, I can begin to see just how radically different my mannerisms no, my personality was affected. All the tension and pressure was constantly building up at home, growing greater and greater every day I felt with every turn of the second hand on the clock I was being crushed enveloped in despair, entwined in regret, torn between conflicts of my conscience and my love for both my parents, warranted or not, it was there to stay. Crushing, crushing, always crushing, never letting up, compressing my being into a tiny ego incapable of feeling emotion because of some self-inflicted wall that I put up that kept me from getting close to anyone. Through all of this, school was my only constant my only vent and how did I vent all this emotional stress? By closing myself up and pulling back from all around me, of course. I was a walking, living, breathing, pile of depressed flesh nothing more. Trouble was, I had become VERY good at hiding it over the years, and to a person that did not know me exceedingly well, I was fine. I was wallowing through school (or lack there of I didnt try at all the entire year: barely squeaking by with a GPA for the year of 3.14) for the first several months until around November or something when I started to get to know Gwen better To this day I still cant remember who started going out of their way to spend more time with the other and get to know them, but Im fairly sure it was her, being as my emotional state and corresponding people skills were hovering very slightly above that of a rocks. Man, shes been such a blessing to life in more ways than I will probably ever know. Whether she knows it or not, she was the one person who was able to break through my massive facade, that huge false pretense that all was well with me, and start to brighten my life. It wasnt like it was a drastic change all at once: no, it was more a gradual breaking away from that impersonal shell that I felt acted as a shield to me. In the latter months right before school ended, this resulted in me acting openly depressed and hard to live with (annoying and such) something Im not proud of but I guess thats what it took to break me out of the bleak barrier that I was cowering under. As I said before, Gods really blessed me with her, and Ive never really communicated that to her. I love her with all my heart, but I still have a ton of lingering interpersonal issue that prevent me from telling her how I really feel about her, no matter how much my heart yearns for me too I want to scream my love for her, but I guess this blog is the closest Ill be able to come to that for a while I guess through all the suffering and tribulation Ive been going through does have a purpose, though I certainly cant see it no matter how far ahead I strain to peer into the far reaches of time and find that more and more, I have to rely on God.  Ok, this post was really random, and prolly doesnt flow well Summary: I love Gwen and Ive never told her how much of an impact shes had on my life in the last several months.

      More country music...   Concrete Angel   She walks to school with the lunch she packed Nobody knows what she's holdin' back Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday She hides the bruises with linen and lace  The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask It's hard to see the pain behind the mask Bearing the burden of a secret storm Sometimes she wishes she was never born  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  Somebody cries in the middle of the night The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate When morning comes it'll be too late  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel

      I have just started listening to country music this last week at work, and have already found a couple songs I really like:   Andy Griggs - "She's More"   I like blue eyes, hers are green. Not like the woman of my dreams. And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned.  Five foot three isn't tall. She's not the girl I pictured at all. In those paint by number fantasies I've had,  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  No it wasn't, at first sight, But the moment I looked twice. I saw the woman I was born to love.  Her laughter fills my soul, And when I hold her I don't wanna let go. When it comes to her I can't get enough.  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  More than I dreamed of, More than any man deserves. I couldn't ask for more than a love like hers.  So it took me by complete surprise, When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  (hehe... Gwen has green eyes.)   Was That My Life?  - Jo Dee Messina   Ooooh.  I don't want to be the one who's old before their time, And lose the wonder that I felt as a child. I can't run this race believing I might lose; There's still so much to see, and so much left to do. Yes, I'll fall before I fly, But no one can say I never tried.  Oh, we just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been, To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them. All those sunny days and all those starry skies: Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights. Oh, I can't tell them enough, Just how much that they are loved.  Oh, you just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   We just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: oh, was that my life? Ooh, was that my life rollin' on by? Oooh, rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on by. Was that my life? Ooooh, was that my life?

      This is something really insightful that a member of  urlLink Youthfire.com , named  urlLink Dave  posted in  urlLink this page :  Love and relationships are truly one of the most paradoxical aspects of being human. For it is in love that we find the greatest of strengths and the deepest of sorrows. Love can seem to be so fleeting and unachievable yet it remains well within our reach if we only learn how to embrace it's power. To experience true love, we must be willing to open ourselves up and sacrifice part of our heart and part of our soul. We must be willing to give of ourselves freely, and we must be willing to suffer. It is only when we expose our inner selves to the white hot flame of rejection, that love can burn so brightly as to join to souls, melding the two into one, creating a bond that joins forever. It is from this bond that we draw strength eternal and power ever lasting. It is in this thing that we call love that we find the means to achieve greatness, both in ourselves and in our lives. ~Author Unknown  ...love is a serious thing. Don't take it for granted. It's not a toy, or a game, or something you just pick up in the street. It's a gift straight from God, treasure it.

      Ok, here I am... posting... at school... again... There's been so much happening over the last two weeks and I cannot really sum it all up any way except by writing it all out (a task that I'm working on at home... still a few more days until a couple of massive posts that will cover that.  Several major points off the top of my head:  1. My small group (plus Steven and Sash.) went on an all-nighter two Fridays ago and TPed Ryan and Drew's (two youth leaders) houses. 2. I drove Wednesday and Thursday with Mr Weber (my Bible and Driver's Ed. teacher). 3. I attended my high school's graduation and recorded it for Gwen 4. I went to a really weird Grad. Party for my friend Christine 5. I went to Song on the Mountains (a really cool romance / comedy play by  urlLink Stages Theater ) with Gwen, Goody and Cam. 6. I went to Brady's Grad. Party and got really wet in a water fight (twas fun). 7. I met the people that I'm going to be working for this summer (more like having fun with). 8. School's out at 12:00 tomorrow!!!

      You know,  urlLink BlogThis!  seems almost too easy to use... I mean it's just sitting there waiting to be clicked, and If you're already logged in... What if some younger sibling or any other similarly incompetent person was to by chance click on it? You never really know what could end up on your site.  Hmmm... randomness

      Man, my dad just doesn't get it... We were talking on the way to work today (my room wasn't clean last night, so he won't let me drive myself anywhere) about his relationship with mom and whether or not he's being loving.  It's so frustrating trying to reason with him. As most of you know, He's from a Moslem background (having been born in Iran and all...) and the way his culture has taught him to think from birth is much different than most of us. We all use "linear reasoning" meaning that when we see a problem, we actively work our way logically to a solution. Example: If we are being kept awake at night by a faucet dripping, we all eventually have to come to the conclusion that the faucet is at fault. Once we have done this, we actively work toward a solution: getting up and turning the faucet all the way off. The way my dad thinks though, is something called circular reasoning where you see a problem and instead of working toward a solution you keep turning around and focusing on the problem. Example: Again we have ourselves almost asleep, but being kept awake by a dripping faucet. Instead of thinking about why the faucets dripping though, we start obsessing about the problem (the faucets dripping, the faucets dripping, the faucets dripping, THE FAUCETS DRIPPING!!!). As you can see the former way of thinking is more logical, but once someones been ingrained with the latter, its very hard to convince them that they are going about it wrong, Imagine if you will that there is not one person, but two people within hearing of the faucet, one equipped with linear reasoning and one with circular, and that the one with linear (whom we will call person A) cannot reach the faucet.   Person B: The faucets dripping. Person A: I can hear the faucets dripping. Person B: The faucets dripping.  Person A: Yes, weve established that the faucets dripping, why dont you just go take care of it? Person B: Because the faucets dripping. Person A: What? How does the faucets dripping keep you from fixing the faucets dripping? Person B: Because the faucets dripping. Person A: WHAT?? Whats wrong with you? Person B: Nothing. Person A: THEN GO FIX THE FAUCET!! Person B: But, the faucets dripping.  This is pretty much how I feel when talking to my dad. He listens to what you say, but he doesnt  listen  to what you say. Actually, its more like he cant comprehend what youre saying.   Anyway, specifically we were talking about what he would do if she got kicked out of (or rather stopped attending because theres no way she feels comfortable there, and what good is a church if its not a place of refuge?) the church that they are both going to. He said that theres no way he would leave I really honed in on that the entire drive to work. He seems convinced that the husband is called to be a hedge of protection around the family only when everyones obeying him to the letter. (By hedge of protection, which is a biblical term, I mean guarding us all from people or things that might oppress us or bring us down  like the stupid people in my moms (now former) church. A small portion of our conversation went something like this:  Me: So youre saying you would stay at Southwest Hills if mom left or was kicked out? Him: Yes Me: Why? Him: Why not? Me: Well, think about it this way: youre always talking about unity and wanting to be one with you wife well what do you think itll do to her, knowing that you still continue going to a church where everyone looks down on her? Him: That is my church. Me: Yes, but your church as a whole seems to be at odds with mom.  silence Me: What are husbands supposed to do for their wives? Him: Love them and provide for them and Me: Whoa, wait a second; the first thing you said is love right? Him: yes Me: how are you displaying you love for her right now? Him: I love her. Me: Thats not what I asked, I asked how youre displaying it. Him: What do you mean? Me: Well, youre supposed to be a protection against things like this that are going on, but instead do you realize what youve become? - The very thing that God designed a husband to protect his wife against! Him: Well, shes the one thats leaving Me: What? And that somehow negates the husbands responsibility to be a shield? Youre to love and protect you family, especially your wife, unconditionally: not just when you think shes deserving of it. Him: But she has left me shield when she disobeyed me. Me: You just dont get it do you? She cant leave; its ALWAYS supposed to be there. Him: Not if she leaves it...  (This went on like this pretty much all the way to work.)  Maybe now you can kinda see the relation to the faucet example in his way of thinking.

      Ok, lets talk girls. (LOL) First off, obviously is Gwen. Im really confused as to my position right now regarding her  Steven, I told you that I was over her and I thought I was, but now I realize that Im not. I still very much in love with her, but Im praying that if its Gods will, that He help me let her go. Her position is just a friend but Im having a hard time adjusting to the idea (yeah, and since we were never technically a couple, that really *ahem* makes sense, yeah...). Though, I only think that way when I think about her by myself; when Im with her, Im fine just being friends. Its not like Im depressed or down over it or anything, Im just really confused with myself right now, thats all I guess.   Second girl, Bwitty; to begin with, dont get me wrong - Im not attracted to her like that, but for some reason I just realized after talking to her today for the first time in... several months (and she lives three blocks below me, how stupid is that?) that I really care about her. I dont get it, I can just see her hurting from a ton of stuff and I get almost... I want to say protective of her, but thats not the right word. Its like I want to just pull her away from all of it. (And the weirdest thing is, I dont really know her that well.) By the way Bwitty, if you read this, please know that Im praying for you.  Third girl, Laurie (and out of you three, youre the only one that actually reads this... if Im thinking right I should have talked about you first... hmm... and the fact that I just said that before posting it makes me question my sanity, but oh well) LOL Ne way, its kinda the same way with you as it is with Bwitty, though I actually know some of the stuff in Bwittys life, and I really dont know too much about you except from your blog and when we talk. Again, though, I find myself really caring about you (though not so much in a protective sense). I guess its more that I can relate to your situation and feel for anyone going through it cause I know what its like. Hey, I got your phone # btw, email me and tell me when a good time to call is. :)  Ok, the fact that I actually wrote that is starting to weird me out, so Im gonna go and get some... sleep... yeah... sleep sounds real good right now...

      Hey, as promised, here are some random pics from tonight (keep in mind that this is way after almost everyone else left):     Steven  urlLink Youthfire chatting  with Josh hidden behind him.    Pic of the sanctuary with the projector screen on the top left, and Steven chatting on it in the control booth at the bottom right. (And yes, this picture was taken from the ceiling. - lol)    Steven and me outside waiting to get picked up by my mom.

      I'm going to take my camera to youth group tonight and take some random pictures with the intention of posting them later tonight.   I need to get working on that  urlLink lyrics / mp3 page  later. In about a week, Im going to be completely revamping my computer network at home and hopefully setting up an apache web server to host my site locally. I may just put off working on anything until then, or I may not.... depends on whether I get bored I guess :)   Oh, I'm applying to join a youth newsletter that  urlLink Laurie's  starting. I may post my "trial" article when I finish it later today or tomorrow.

      On Thursday, I talked to Drew for a while regarding issues between the Lees and Rivas. He advised me to stay neutral in the whole thing so that I could better benefit everyone. If I draw over to one side, what good am I doing?  On Friday, I got off work early before lunch, and drove Trung and Loren (coworkers) around town, from PCC Sylvania all the way over to Wilsonville, and back to several other places. We kept taking back roads at Trungs direction and getting lost :). After several hours of this, I finally dropped them off at Tonys house and went back to mine to get ready for the mini-concert at our church later. I dropped by Gwens work on the way over to church and finally saw her after she got back from the trip. She didnt want to take a break, so she walked me out to my car, carrying my only purchased item, a 2-liter of Ginger Ale (lol).   I finally got to church slightly past 4:30 and helped with setup. The concert officially started at 6:00, but we bumped it back an hour total, to accommodate setting the sound system up more precisely. It was really fun - Freeborn, my friend Jos band played. We had ramps and rails for boarding and bmx, plus a bbq and some other stuff. Katie, Kat, Melissa and Adri came. I stayed after until past 11:40, tearing down and putting stuff away.  On Sat., I went to Goodys house for Davids surprise B-day party. Later, Goody and I got a ride to the MAX station where we met Trung, Josh, Loren, Tony, Jason, and two other people and went to the Lloyd Center to see Pirates of the Caribbean. (Thats an AWESOME movie!!! Johnny Depps performance was perfect, and the movie as a whole couldnt have been done better. If you havent seen it yet, see it!). We saw some rather interesting people every time we got on / off the MAX: one kid was just being an idiot, cussing at everyone he saw, including old ladies and stuff. Everyone on the car started talking about him in hushed tones when he got off. Another guy is a mime that Ive seen down at Waterfront Park before  he paints his entire body, hair, face... clothes, silver and sits motionless for hours at a time. Then there were the two... dysfunctional women... who got into a fight on the tracks at the Lloyd Center Station and stopped a train. Then, they seemed content with hurling both insults and physical objects at each other from across the station until another train arrived, and one got on. Then, the other woman would occasionally get up and start screaming and beating at unseen people seemingly following her around. ...Interesting night.  Sunday morning, COUNTRY FEST 2003!!! (well, actually it wasnt that good) basically Trung, Loren, Josh, Jason and I drove for 2 hours out to St. Helens in two cars and spent the day tanning under the sun, listening to mind-numbingly loud country music. We were stationed more than 800 feet from the stage, and the bass woofers still shook the ground... Thats a little too much power, methinks. Later, it only took us an hour and a half to get home because we took the roads that we had completely overlooked on the way there. I was depressed the entire day after I got home. Everyone was cranky and needed a nap or something (lol).  Monday morning, work... I was still really depressed until mid afternoon, when Trung and I washed my bosss house for two hours (lol). For some reason, it was then that I regained my vitality and joyful spirit and all. Later that evening, my parents attended a church-wide meeting at their church that would be the springboard for the church to vote whether of not to kick my mom out (In my very wise uncles words: I was at the stupid meeting last night. Wished I could have been somewhere else, but Im glad I was there to support your mom. Those people there are... CRAZY, for lack of a more demeaning term.)  Today, I got to work late since my room wasnt clean, and my parents new punishment to obsess with is not letting me drive anywhere. They are going to start using that as recklessly as they confiscated my Xbox back in Feb. They kept adding on and on time till I could have it back, until as of now, I am entitled to have it back sometime next Spring (though I just decided to go and take it out of their room two weeks ago, and either they havent noticed it yet, or theyre trying to act like they dont care.  My mom and I went out to lunch today (she picked me up from work), and we had a long talk about every topic ranging from Gwen, to work, to school next year, to the meeting last night at her church. I love my mom; shes so easy to talk to. :)  Today, I went up to Gwens house at about 8:15pm and didnt get back down until almost 10:20. While I was up there she made some random comment about how long my hair was, and within ten minutes she was giving me a haircut (lol). I need to take a picture of myself now, Im all buzzed. My foot's sore from kicking her punching bag for like, 20 minutes.   Tomorrow, Im letting Trung borrow my Xbox and Im borrowing his PS2 for ...a week I think.  Well, goodnight everyone, and may God watch over your sleep.

      Hey everyone, sup? I dunno what was wrong with me the last couple days... I was so unfailingly joyful for a couple weeks then I sunk into a huge depression. But now, through my own realization that God is in control of my life, coupled with the support of friends, I'm fine again.   This is a poem that  urlLink Laurie  wrote and emailed to me yesterday after reading my Mon Jul 21, 11:40:00 AM post. Thanks, Laurie, that meant alot to me:   I bled for you    Everything is fading away Everything but my pain There's nothing left in me I think I'm going insane  Truth or lie I feel like I'm falling away I'd rather die Than feel this way  Where is the love you promised Where is the peace you share Where is the golden rainbow Or do you even care?  My eyes are hollow holes I'm drowning in my hurt I reach out, reach up I'm falling to the dirt  There's a cavity inside me I'm falling down into the pit It has no bottom, I'm forever falling Something doused the candle that was lit  I'm falling, falling Falling away from you Something's pulling me down Holding onto me like glue  Tears keep falling down my face I am powerless to stop them This is my only release Until I hit rock bottom  I want to die Why am I alive The question echoes through me Cutting through me like a knife  I look at my heart Bloody, stained, broken Then my heart echoes With words softly spoken  "Did you know I bled for you?" The thought pierces my soul My God, my God, have you forsaken me? "No, my heart is full."  "I bled too, my son I know how you feel" You couldn't! I yell "But I have, it is the seal."  "My heart bleeds even now At your pain that seems so endless" Tears flow faster down my cheeks, At the memories of bliss  "Cry my son, Cry for the love Cry for the loss Cry for the blood."     Laurie, 2003

      I just wrote this ten minutes ago.   The End    My life, my comfort, my shell of hope, Creaked and groaned with every passing day But now its all finally come crashing down God help me,  I never thought it would end this way.  Alone in the darkness The dawn brings not hope, But despair and distress Challenge me to cope.  Im left in the ruins  Of all I can see Fathomless grief  Consuming me.  No one to run to,  Nowhere to hide, Nothing to live for,  No path by which to bide.  The fire which once Gave light to my heart Burns down to nothing; Shadow, Light depart.  As I wander this wasteland Over and over, Again and again, Memories of every kind Flood past me,  Thoughts of what could have been  Of what could have been.

        Drive - Incubus   Sometimes, I feel the fear of  Uncertainty stinging clear. And I cant help but ask myself How much Ill let the fear  Take the wheel and steer.  Its driven me before, and it seems to Have a vague, haunting mass appeal. But lately I am beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel.  Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there, Ill be there  So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of The hive Will I choose water over wine and hold my own And drive?  Its driven me before and it seems to be the way That everyone else gets around. But lately Im beginning to find that When I drive myself My light is found.  Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there, Ill be there  (Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?)  Would you choose Water over wine Hold the wheel And drive?  Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there, Ill be there   That's all I can think of tonight folks... I'm way too burned out... I want to crawl into a dark hole and sleep for a week. Or maybe die, that sounds better. Hmm... scratch that... Dying in and of itself seems rather pointless, but the property of being dead... Oh God I wish I could just be gone from here.

      Oh man, I could listen to this song for an eternity... I love it, it's so beautiful.    Nina Gordon - Tonight and the rest of my life   Down to the earth I fell with dripping wings Heavy things wont fly And the sky might catch on fire And burn the axis of the world thats why I prefer a sunless sky To the glittering and stinging in my eyes  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life  Gleaming in the dark sea Im as light as air floating there breathlessly When the dream dissolves I open up my eyes I realize that Everything is shoreless sea A weightlessness is passing over me  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life And I  Everything is waves and stars The universe is resting in my arms  I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life   I'm going to sleep to this song tonight. :)

I don't know why I didn't post about that before now... maybe I've been slightly preoccupied (lol)

      This post kinda incorporates a response to  urlLink Kevins  comment about my last post, in it.    that's too bad Armaan. at least you get to be friends. I have a friend that this (very similar) thing happened to recently. He was/is crushed. It's a bad thing that happens between people. I urge you to keep praying about it if you still have feelings for her. This may be God's way of preparing her for a good relationship with you? Who among us knows the mind of God? Anyway, my point is she can still change her mind in the future. ~Kevin    The sad thing is, I was planning to tell her everything about how I feel and how much she means to me the next time I talked to her, but now Im glad I didnt. I cant imagine how hard it would have been for her to tell me that if I had started out by telling her how I felt about her. She has a hard enough time as it is just telling me stuff that could potentially hurt me to begin with. (Shes such a sweet girl... she really doesnt want to hurt me, but at the same time, she doesnt want to lead me on. I really respect her for that.)  Anyway, yeah, I really dont want to loose her as a friend. I guess that I would venture to say that keeping a good friendship with her is more important than any type of romantic relationship, if it has the possibility of leaving us farther apart than when we started. Plus, the only way Ill be happy with the situation is if shes happy: We could be dating steadily, but if shes not happy, Im not happy. Same goes with another guy: If shes in a relationship with someone else, and isnt happy, Im not going to be happy, but if she is, then I most likely will be (or at least will try to be).  As far as where this relationship is going... Your guess is as good as mine (lol). I think Ill just have to sit back and trust God on that one. (Hey, what am I saying? I have to trust him for the entire thing.) Through all this though, my love for her is not even flickering... I pray that if its not Gods will that we never get back together, that He would take my love for her from me, but if we ever will, I pray that I never get involved with another girl between now and then... I want to be there for her if shes ever in a time of need.  Oh, btw, Im meeting Drew tomorrow to talk and pray about the... issue surrounding two families that I love, and want to have good relations restored between.

      Gwen called! (lol - ok... enough) She's back and had a great time. We talked for around an hour and ten minutes starting at 12:20 (late... yeah, but that is our custom).   You know, I was secretly afraid this was going to happen the entire time, but I guess I pretty well convinced myself that it wasn't, because if I'd thought about it for long enough, I would have been insanely depressed... and now that it actually has happened... exactly as I feared it would but never thought it would, I think I can handle it.  Well, maybe...  Hmm...  Only time will tell...   What on earth am I talking about you ask? Well, in the course of our conversation tonight (this morning - lol) Gwen told me that she had something that she wanted to talk to me about (Im thinking *oh no, here it comes*). She said she had been doing a lot of thinking about it over the three weeks she was away, and had decided that it would probably be better if we just remained friends... never to become anything greater. She went on to say that (*yup, I guessed it alright*) she had found someone that she was more interested in while on the trip. (Story of my life.) Immediately afterward though, she added that she wanted to continue being friends, and I heartily agreed.  After that our normal conversation resumed and we talked for another 45 minutes until her mom made us (well, me since she knows I have work early in the morning, and Gwen doesn't) get off.  o.O I just remembered that email I sent, that I know for certain she hasn't read yet... Hmmm... I wonder what effect that'll have...  Well, good night and happy landings and don't forget to check out the newest of my friend's blogs...  urlLink Andrew's

        the Ataris - In This Diary   Here in this diary, I write you visions of my summer. It was the best I ever had. There were choruses and sing-alongs, and not a spoken feeling. I'm knowing that right now is all that matters. All the nights we stayed up talking and listening to 80's songs; quoting lines from all those movies that we love. It still brings a smile to my face. I guess when it comes down to it...  Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart and eventually you'll finally get it right.  Breaking into hotel swimming pools, and wreaking havoc on our world. Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time. The black top's singing me to sleep. Lighting fireworks in parking lots, illuminate the blackest nights. Cherry cokes under this moonlight summer sky. 2015 Riverside, it's time to say, "goodbye." Get on the bus, it's time to go.  Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart, and eventually you'll finally get it right.

      Cameran wanted me to post this email, so I'm doing so;  Subject: Or you can put this on my blog   Hey Armaan, I have been thinking about all that has been going on non-stop.  and how tired I'm.   I have been weighing out everything, and what is good for me.  I also have been talking to my Mom about it all.  And here is my opinion, because I'm done with all this crap.  ---------------------------------------------------- I know if Brady really wanted to he could turn around. Brady Can't be helped, I wanted to help him, because he is a great guy.  the reason he can't be helped is because he won't help himself. why you ask? because He loves attention, that's why he continues to be in areas or subjects having to do with the rivas family or anything that gives attention to him.  And I'm sure that's not the only problem. ---------------------------------------------------- I'm not saying I'm perfect we all have problems,insecurities, and issues, I guess just one of mine is low tolerance.    My only friends that have helped me grow mentally are you armaan and andrew motimer.  ---------------------------------------------------- And the Rivas family in my opinion, not having to do with Brady or beth...just my own experience, are the type of people I hope to never be like.    They have everything wrong about me, even how they think they know me, If they really knew me they would hate me like they hate Brady, I'm sure. I'm also "VERY" tired of being bossed around by people who think they are better in every way, when they really aren't, because no man is above another we are all equally guilty.  and when you don't do as they say some tend to get physical or argue aloud. And I don't want to be around that anymore. I really have nothing good to say about the Rivas family,  and just one of the reasons I can't be a friend to the Rivas family is because in there minds they are perfect, and there is no helping the perfect. so I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- And going to Drew could help you, but most likely won't, and you know what? I hope I'm completely wrong about every single thing I have said so far and that I will say.     ----------------------------------------------------   I'm cutting myself off from this whole mess. I have a new screen name. I will no longer be answering the phone for these numbers/people and not because I hate the people I just hate the way, and well the retardedness at times.      [at this point he lists all phone numbers associated with the Lee and Rivas families]     Family's: Rivas Lee         And I have blocked certain e-mail addresses. I wonder if this is what you might call a mental break down of some kind. O and tell the rivas family not to bother coming to my house, because like I have said I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- Here is some advise to the rivas family in the matter of Brady and ect:    This is love: To love people as we find them, and if they have weaknesses, to accept them with a heart filled with love.   "Love never fails." 1 Cor. 13:8   A friend is someone that will except you the way he or she found you, And if she or he has weaknesses, to accept him or her with a heart filled with love and to help them no matter the matter because that is just one of the many things friend are for.   1 Corinthians 13:1-13  I may speak in the tongues of men, even angels; but if I lack love, I have become merely blaring brass or a cymbal clanging.  I may have the gift of prophecy, I may fathom all mysteries, know all things, have all faith-enough to move mountains; but if I lack love, I am nothing.  I may give away everything that I own, I may even hand over my body to be burned; but if I lack love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient and kind, not jealous, not boastful, not proud, rude or selfish, not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not gloat over other peoples sins  But takes its delight in the truth. Love always bears up, always trusts, always hopes, always endures.  Love never ends; but prophecies will pass, tongues will cease, knowledge will pass. For our knowledge is partial, and our prophecy partial; but when the perfect comes, he partial will pass.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, argued like a child; now that I have become a man, I have finished with childish ways.   For now we see obscurely in a mirror, but then it will be face to face. Now I know partly; then I will know fully, just as God has fully known me.  But for now, three things last- Trust, Hope, Love; And the greatest of these is Love.   -----------------------------------------------------    Our "group"  (circle of friendship)  is a place of warmth and caring  (but for me its been cold because of serious competition in the area of play or "games", and caring which is fake if acted out)  Where people come together  (now there is a rift in-between the Lee family and the Rivas family which complicates and complicates over and over.)  for listening and sharing. ( which can be hard at times because of the rift but other wise is easy for me and you) A place of kindness and trust. ( it used to be, and if there still is its decaying) of tears and laughter too; ( tears of joy? I don't think so at the moment, laughter seems a bit scares but I could be wrong.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Armaan, I know I suck as a friend too. I'm very sorry about everything. if you could you might want to put this on your blog. but you might wanna edit out the phone #. I'm sure I'll talk to you soon, but I will see you later dude.   Sincerely,  Cameran Renata Heckenlaible      p.s. I'm done  .....Hiding in my hole, like andrew.

      Ok, yesterday morning I got up at 5:15 (not 4:00 like Id planned) and ran to finish packing before 6:00 when Laurie would get to my house... Im glad I did rush since, even with her dad getting lost for 15 minutes, (lol) I was still a little late getting out to the car.   Once I finally got out, my mom drove us an hour-an-a-half down to OSU (Oregon State) in Corvallis. We were they that day and today for the Mid-Summer Conference - part of our apprenticeships through ASE (Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering), and division of Saturday Academy. We got down there, signed in, ate a continental breakfast and hung out for a while, all before the orientation session at 9 oclock. After that, all 150 of us apprentices there split up into groups of about 15 and played some really random get-to-know-you games together for a while. Then, we had the first of several lectures that day (we picked the ones we wanted to attend beforehand), ate lunch, and had a couple more lectures and a hands-on workshop. Dinner was fun - the caf that we ate in was sweet.   After dinner, we split up into 20 groups at the MU Quad and set about defying gravity by building 2 meter tall towers out of nothing but newspaper, a tiny bit of tape and a predetermined random object. The tower had to support itself in the wind, suspending a marble from it, for a minimum of ten seconds. Awards were given to the two teams who built the most complex tower, and the cheapest tower. My group won the first title and Lauries won the second (lol)  Later that night, my little group of friends (Laurie, and some random people we had just met from Lakeview  Wade and Kate, and other people) went swimming. The pools at OSU are sweet. :)  They consisted of a huge diving pool, Olympic-size relay pool and a mammoth hot tub. Twas quite fun. After I got out, I spent like ten minutes in a frikin hot sauna drying off. As we were walking back, Wade and some random girl decided to run through some random sprinklers for a while, and while they were doing so, others informed me about some really funny senior pranks they pull at their school. (This was almost 9:45 at night, and it had finally cooled down from 85 to around 75.)   Once I got back to the dorm, I changed and walked back down to the MU (the under-story of which is a pool hall / bowling alley / mini theater place. I left shortly thereafter, because of the heat. (I met Laurie walking back from it as I walked to it and she warned me that it was hot in there, but did I listen? ... no  lol) Later, close to 10:45 or 11:00 I grabbed a couple pop tarts and watched part of Monty Python and the Holy Grail before getting back up to my room. My roommates and I didnt get to sleep for what must have been a couple hours, partly because of the heat, and partly because of random logic and word problems we kept giving each other... like: whats the only word in the English language whos pronunciation and meaning are both changed by capitalizing the first letter? polish >> Polish (interesting, huh?).  Ne way, I got up this morning around 7:00 instead of 6:00 and decided to forgo a shower for the day. I packed all my luggage and turned in my room key (but not my food card, which I needed for dinner the night before and breakfast later that morning). I had cereal for breakfast...yum.   Right after breakfast, we took group pictures on the steps of the MU (We were commenting that we all felt like a combination of a junior MENSA, FFA and some major communist party, 150 of us intellectual teenagers, walking down the streets of a major college, all wearing the same light blue shirt. We took several pictures, and I realized later that photographer in front of us didnt have the only camera trained on us: Theres a live webcam on the building the Quad from us that was recording a time-lapse video that I dled, and am working on extracting an image from. Once I do so, Ill post it.   The next lecture was the only one Laurie and I had in common. Sooo... um... *how to say?* boring. The next one for me was worse, actually, but the last hands-on one was SO fun. It was so random; was on automatic data storage and collection. At one point, one of the students needed a hand-held barcode scanner, across the room, so an instructor picked one up and threw it to him. I though that was strange and asked him, Umm... how much are those worth? He replied calmly Oh, about 55 hundred a piece. Later, when I asked him why he was just throwing 5 grand pieces of equipment around haphazardly, he responded by picking up another one, and throwing across the room. Turns out the scanners are the best on the market... insured for up to a 12 foot drop onto concrete (lol).  We had lunch on the Quad (like the yesterday) and I called Bwitty, and actually got a hold of her for the first time in months! (An accomplishment, I feel.) Laurie ended up talking to her for like, twenty times longer than I did.   Anyway, later there was a final meeting, during which my mom showed up and told me to step outside quickly and call my dad since he was putting a down payment on what was going to be my new car. *yay* Later, we drove back home, Laurie got picked up at my house, and I drove the van for the first time, by myself, to the theater to see LXG (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  Man, I spent so much time with Laurie over the last two days. Every break, every meal, we were together, talking or something. Shes a cool girl and Id never really gotten to know her that well. Altogether, the Conference was an awesome time.

      Today was fun. Two things of interest happened:  (In order of priority) 1. Gwen called again!  2. I got my drivers license!  I got up late, and found the address for the DMV on the way there... (lol), waited in lines for a while and finally got assigned an examiner. You know how they always tell you not to engage in small talk with the examiner while taking the test... itll only distract you? Apparently they werent thinking of me and my instructor. We were chatting the entire time... Topics ranged from to the weather, our jobs, buildings being demolished on the side of the road, and even random rodents running across the road at odd times (in the middle of a city...). LOL. After that I went back inside, waited in more lines and finally took the test on the computer, got my picture taken and received my license.   I drove back home, got stuff for work and headed over to work, arriving at 11:15 (I usually get there at 8:00). I worked for an hour, talked on the phone with Gwens mom for another hour while programming PIC chips and starting my lunch break (lol), took another half hour for the rest of my lunch break, and got back to work. Stuff was going smoothly until a technical rescue vehicle, followed by an ambulance pulled into view. (As my other posts say, it turned out that my bosss wife has a major insulin reaction. He blood sugar level was 239ish around lunch, and dropped to 29 in three hours. Anyway, they gave her an IV and she was fully conscious within a few minutes.  I got off work at 5:00, went home, chatted on IRC chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire for an hour or so, ate dinner, and headed over to Mid-Week. (I was going to drive over to Cams house, but I thought Steven might need a ride back from Mid-Week, so I had my dad take me there and back  I cant drive anyone under 20, outside of my family for 6 months, with Oregon driving rules). The funny thing is, Steven and I didnt even end up seeing each other and didnt know the other was even there until we talked about it later on the same chat room listed above.  Then, at 9:22, Gwen called! (lol) I was beginning to suspect Id have to wait for her to get back to talk to her next, but no, she was sweet and called again :)  My dad and I ate at Carls Jr., and he told me about a walk hed had with my mom earlier. Thats cool  twas the first time theyve done that in... a long while.  Oh, btw, Im gonna have to leave youth group really early tomorrow night, since I have to get up at 4 the nest morning. (Loris coming over at 6, and we need to be checked into the ASE Mid-Summer Conference by 8:30 in Corvallis). My moms prolly going to end up spending the night down there, since its easier to do that than to some back up then go back down and back up again on Sat.   Well, see yah all on the flipside (and I fear for  urlLink Ddee  and her platinum hair.... *shudders* - lol)

      o.O Uh oh, an ambulance just drove up... I'd better go check and see what's going on...  ***half-an-hour later***  Ok, it was just my boss's wife having an insulen reaction ("just"... yeah i know). She doesn't remember calling 911. Strange...

      ok, I emailed Gwen last night, but forgot to post the email before I got off, so here you go:    Subject: Thinking about you...  Hey Gwen, howre you doing? I know that youll not be reading this until after you get back (possibly way after, knowing your email checking habits - lol) but Ill write it like I am writing to you right now, not you a week from now.   ...If you understood that, Ill be happy cause I barely do reading through it again, tired as I am.   Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I miss you and Im praying for you. A couple days after I got that letter asking for prayer for the trip, I tacked it up on my wall to remind me to do just that. Initially, it helped a lot, Id see it as I was going to bed, and pray for you for a while every night. Even several weeks before you left, it got so ingrained in my mind, that I was praying for the trip more than a couple times a day. (In fact, I dont know really why I still have the letter up maybe just sentimental reasons). Now, youre one of the biggest things on my mind, day by day. I almost laughed when you asked me to be praying for everyones health to stay strong, in spite of lack of sleep, when you called last Tuesday. That was one of the major things God had pressed upon my heart since the day I found out you were going on the trip. Oh, and its not just me several of my friends around the world are praying for the trip (and specifically you) too. They know nothing really about you other than youre a friend of mine thats going on a mission trip for around three weeks, and that I knew that youd be appreciative if they were praying for it and for you.   On a slightly more personal note: I really do miss you. Im gonna be so happy when I see your pretty face again, or even hear your voice. :)  (Do me a favor: dont go somewhere far away for college right after you graduate. Thats really going to get to me, having to spend my senior year not really seeing you at all. Hmm I guess Ill just have to trust God about that one. Oh, by the way, speaking of God, I have to praise Him: all this week, more and more stuff has been happening to my family, but through it all, Ive been amazingly happy. I just cant get over this joyful spirit, and I thank the Lord for it (and I thank you for caring enough to tell me out right to stay happy last time we talked).    Oh well, my contacts are starting to annoy my eyes and I have to get up  an hour early tomorrow for work, so Id better wrap this up and send it.   With love, in Christ,   ~Armaan

      Ok, this post is a reply to Steven's latest post on  urlLink his blog . In fact, I would be writing this in his comments section, but it's just way too long.  The following is part of his 7/8/2003 01:51:36 PM post:    Why the heck did God give me the life he did? Why couldn't I have the life of so many other people... they are happy. Why was I given this life to live? I'm supposed to learn from it? I'd rather not; I'd rather that I had a life like other people. Mine is freaking messed up.    Yeah, I kinda know how you're feeling right now (kinda cause my situation at home is slightly different from yours... but not by much). I've been going through this whole emotional Ferris wheel too. One minute, things will be fine with my dad, then the next it's a hurricane. I think so often, "God, why oh why did I even have to be born to live this life? Why did you pick me? Is there something I'm supposed to get out of it; is there something you're preparing me for? I don't want to go through this to become closer to You, I want to be close NOW, Lord... Why couldn't you have picked someone else to live through this hell, someone better suited for it? I just want to get out... want to get out.... want. to. get. out.  Steven, like you, right now I can't really offer many answers, only more questions. But one thing I do know (though I think many times that I'm mistaken, but always realize I was right after all, after a time): No matter how hard it is to see it now (and in some cases, even impossible), God does have a plan for our lives; He loves us and knows what's best for us. Though oh, so many times I wish God would just take me from this earth, or better yet, cause me to never have been born. All this having been said, I'm forced to wonder why he picked me (why he picked us). If God had not been with us all this time, helping us through it, I truly believe we would have cracked far before now.   Whatever... if I say anything else, it'll just be rambling on and on about what I just said, so I'll leave it at that.

      I just got back from my Goody, David and Sara's house, where we had a short HALO LAN party. In attendance were Goody, David, Cam, Caleb, Dallas, Ryan, Ben, Sara and me. I brought a large tv and my XBOX.  We (Goody, David, Cam and me) creamed everyone else royally. 'Twas fun. :)  Earlier this morning, I went to my orthodontist to get a permanent retainer re-bonded. Took like, 5 minutes, but I missed the first hour-and-a-half of work for it. Oh well, I'll just come in a half-hour early, tomorrow through Thursday.  Steven and I were going to go to a youth counseling thing tomorrow night called Teens Helping Teens, but my mom was at the facility today and found out that they had a recent schedule change - same time, but Mondays, not Tuesdays. I hope well both be able to make it to it now that its a different day.  Ok, I just cant post this without mentioning Gwen. (lol) Im really starting to miss her now, and its only been like 10 days. I cant imagine what its going to be like if she goes far off someplace to college for a year while Im still a senior in high school. Hmm thinking about that just depresses me, so instead Ill think about seeing her again when she gets back. I might write her an email or two for her to read when she gets back, but I know she never checks her email... so it might be pointless. Nah, I'll do it anyway.  Listening to  John Tesh -  Goodnight Moon .   Close your eyes and drift away... Touch the stars in the sky on the way...   (the singer sings the rest so softly that it's hard to pick out some of her words, so I'll juss leave it at that.  Goodnight world. Sleep well. (Be safe, those of you north of the border... come home soon.)

      People that need prayer:  1. Gwen (man, I miss her) > For her mission trip, that everything will continue to go well, that people will continue to function with lack of sleep and that they would all be protected from any diseases that might be going around (and bugs and stuff). 2. My mom > She's been under constant emotional attack lately, not only from my dad and sister, but also from the majority of her church, who have sided with my dad. 2. My sister > She's kinda heading down the wrong path, siding with my dad in all the new issues. She's becoming harder and harder to live with and I want that to change. 3. Bwitty > She's going through a tough time in her life right now. I don't really know any details, if you read  urlLink her blog , you'll be about as informed as I. 4. Josiah, Jesh and Jalon's family. > Apparently they just lost a grandpa. 5. People like me, Steven and Laurie (a friend from  urlLink YouthFire.com  - check out  urlLink her blog ), who live in situations involving an abusive, or at least, over domineering parent.  Goodnight fellow firework-toting patriots and others, alike. Go with God.

      [Music Mood]: A Few Questions - Clay Walker  We got the organ today :) It's tight. My dad wants to keep it in the garage untill we get it cleaned up, but then I hope to move it to the main area in the basement. (There's a slight possibility that it won't fit into the basement door, so we may have to put it on the main floor.) :D  btw, I posted a new song to my blog last post, but forgot to post the lyics *gasp* Soooo, here they are:   Lifehouse - Hanging by a Moment   Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  Forgetting all I'm lacking Completely and complete I'll take your invitation You take all of me  Now, I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  There's nothing left to lose Nothing left to fly There is nothing in the world that can change my mind There is nothing else There is nothing else  Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  Just hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment here with you

      [Music Mood]: Lifehouse  Hanging by a Moment  Gwen called again today! :) I was so happy so hear her voice again (lol).   I'm constructing some massive fireworks (some for the 4th, some for... other purposes). Were prolly going to the Jeshs house on the fourth and I might light some off there.   Tomorrow were getting an electric organ. :) For free :)  Thursday night, Adrie, Melissa, Rachael and Josh are all coming to my youth group for a welcome home thingy for the newly-arrived-back Mexico team. Should be fun.

      My new fav. country song:    Lonestar -  My Front Porch Looking In   Oh yeah Yeah oh yeah  The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view I can sit and watch the fields fill up With rays of glowing sun Or watch the moon lay on the fences Like that's where it was hung My blessings are in front of me It's not about the land I'll never beat the view From my front porch looking in  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them And the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in, yeah  I've traveled here and everywhere Following my job I've seen the paintings from the air Brushed by the hand of God The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea But I can't wait to get back home To the one he made for me It's anywhere I'll ever go and everywhere I've been Nothing takes my breath away Like my front porch looking in  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them Yeah the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in  I see what beautiful is about When I'm looking in  Not when I'm looking out  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them Yeah the view I love the most  Oh, the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in Yeah Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk (From my front porch looking in) A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah And the most beautiful girl (Beautiful girl From my front porch looking in) Holding both of them Oh, yeah

      Anyway, recap: my dad was being an idiot and harrassing my mom for a while on the 1st floor, but i had no idea since I was up here in my room (3rd floor), online. My grandma called me and told me that she was on another phone with my mom, who was on another phone with the police. I had my sister (the younger one) lock herself in her room since I didn't know really what was going on, or how serious it was, and went downstairs to the room my mom was currently in. She was visibly shaken and I could tell my dad had really scared her. We waited a few minutes for the police to arrive and my dad, naturally came down and accosted the door of the room we were in for a bit before going up to the front door and answering it. Once we heard the front door open, my mom was fine with going up, so we did and then I went back up to my room for a bit while the police talked to my parents alone and kinda calmed the situation down. Later, my dad wanted to talk to me about why he had walked out on my presentation yesterday, but only succeded in making me all the more angry with him. He can be such a jerk when he wants to be... And we're all going to have to spend the next week with him up in Canada... joy...  Anyway, situation's passed, standby for more outbreaks of rage...

           find out more at  urlLink jimmyeat.meetup.com    That's an awesome idea. :) I'm actually considering going to that.  Ddee, Andrew, Cam, Steven... wanna come with? (lol) I really don't have any idea if i'm even doing anything that day yet or not. ;)  This is an amazing J.E.W. song: it's written to Jimmy's girlfriend who died in a tragic car accident way before J.E.W. ever became a band. (At least that's the more popular of the two stories of how the song same to be, and it makes sense.)    Jimmy Eat World - Hear You Me     There's no one in town I know. You gave us some place to go. I never said thank you for that. I thought I might have one more chance. What would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that, Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead yo in.  So what would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that. Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleeplss go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.  And if you were with me tonight. I'd sing to you just one more time. A song for a heart so big, God couldn't let it live.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.    One of the many thing that's awesome about this band is their dedication to their fans and to their music, not to the money - This is an actual Q&A I got from  urlLink http://www.jimmyeatworld.net/history/faq.html , a division of the official site.   Q.  How does the band feel about mp3s / bootlegs / napster / ebay / file sharing?   A.  I can't give an actual quote from the band, but I will tell you this. The band gave away all their songs for free on their website before Self-Titled (Bleed American) was even released (and they are still there!) . The band seems to not have a problem with sites that offer live mp3s to fans for free. On the other hand, the band said they hate when people sell their stuff on ebay. So I guess you could say that the band is cool if you are trading stuff between music fans, but they do not want you selling anything. Hopefully people can be trusted to purchase the CDs that contain the songs they download, if they are available.   Goodnight my beloveds, may God watch over your sleep, and when you're awake, may God direct your life.

      Ok, important things first: (lol) I had a great conversation with Gwen on Sunday night. I had called her house a couple times before 10:00 or so, but it was busy so I got online and she got on around 11:30. I asked if she would mind calling me when she got off, and she did later. We talked for a total of almost an hour (she called twice) and in that time I basically explained to her how I'd been feeling all this time and everything (mainly that I am in love with her) and that seemed to take her by shock. As far as calling her, she doesn't want me to stop, but maybe do it slightly less frequently. Oh, btw, I did inform her that I was perfectly content with being 'just friends' and she seemed relieved by that. I want her to be happy, and she is, so I am too. :)  The same night my friend Danie (short for Danielle, not Daniel) introduced me to a couple of her friends named Becky and Mandy. (... well more like they started talking under the false pretence of being her - lol). That Beckys the one that confused SSs Becky with her comment on the message board (lol).  I'm under some level of stress concerning a huge presentation I have to have to give on Sat. for my apprenticeship. Please be parying that I'll get everything done well and on time. Oh, btw, I very much doubt that I'll be online much, much less blog between now and then. And... I'm gonna be gone all of next week, so don't expect to see me online for a while. Ddee, I will be back before the 30th, but most likely I'm already attending a key signing party at Mikminamen's on the waterfront. Linus Torvald (however you spell his last name) might be there! I'm excited. :) :)

      Ok, heres the post about Sat. that I told people, on Sat. that Id be posting, but procrastinated  as is my nature. (lol)  I woke up at 10:15 from a phone call from Andrew who had just woken up too. (We were both planning on getting up somewhere in the area of 9, and we did, but we both went back to sleep again - LOL). I got ready as quickly as possible, but right as I was heading out the door, I was stopped by my dad who declared that I wasnt going anywhere until I cleaned my room, vacuumed the house and washed the dishes. I weaseled my way out of that, but it still seemed to set me back about half an hour more Andrew just eventually met me at a McDonalds by his house. We at brunch there and headed off to the mall (illegally, yes in Oregon you have to have your license for 6 months before you can even drive one person under 20, outside of your family.  dumb law, I think, but I guess there are enough stupid kids my age here to warrant passing more laws to restrict them.)    urlLink   Andrew at McDonalds.    Once we got to the mall, we met up with Ddee and Kristy and headed over to the bus stop. Little did we know that would be the start of the first many, many loooooong waits at bus stops all day (but its all good, thats when we would talk the most  waiting for busses)    urlLink   Ddee and Kristy waiting for us at the mall      urlLink   part of a wall of mirrors that always reflect straight back at you  I was a ditz and used the flash.      Once the bus finally got there (like  an hour later), we rode it to a transit center in downtown Portland, but before we got off, we met an interesting couple that seemed rather... high. We (the four of us) had been talking about fire and explosives, specifically my friend and his dad blowing up a microwave in some random field on part of their property. These two college students who had just boarded the buss set about trying to convince us not to become Unabombers, but if we were going to, to become artistic Unabombers. The guy started going off on how the world needed more art and culture and less hate, while then girl started letting phrases she must have heard from a stoned professor somewhere fall out of her mouth like, positive aura less negativity means a better life and peace not war, love not hate. She was doing this is perfect combination with the rather elaborate movements her arms kept making at random intervals. HAHAHA We all burst out laughing for a full 30 seconds or so, as we drove away from the stop at which they had exited.  After waiting for another ten or so minutes downtown, we boarded another bus which took us to the Oregon City Transit Center. In this bus we met another quirky, if not quite so amusing fellow who seemed to take a little too fond a liking to Ddee and Kristy. O, btw, he was drunk too. We were sitting at a right angle along the side and back of the bus, with Andrew one seat ahead of the guy, Ddee and Kristy two seats behind him and me two seats to their left. I was seriously thinking about just getting up and sitting between the guy and them since he was seriously making me nervous, but Andrew beat me to it by moving our stuff out of that seat and sitting between them and me. The guy procceded to give us a rather lengthy life story about how he was too rich and too smart to work, and how he grew the best pot in the state, right in his own backyard. I think we got him to think he wanted to get off at a sooner stop than he would have by how many times we asked him which stop was his, but who knows maybe he did live there?  Once we got to the Oregon City Transit Center, we waited for another half hour or more for the next and final bus to arrive that would take us to what we have now dubbed as the POC (Piece Of Crap) Fair.  While we were waiting, Ddee and Kristy pretended to fight for at least 20 minutes. I took what would have been some better pictures of them doing that, but my camera SUCKS so none of them looked anywhere near good.    urlLink   I think Ddee just kicked Kristy, but Im not sure.       urlLink   Kristy rushing Ddee.      urlLink   This thing is seriously attached to his head. (lol)    Once we got to the destination, we quickly realized it wasnt as  [insert gratifying adverb here] as it was made out to be. We thought at first we should name it the kiddy fair, but we liked the other name better. I had a headache, so I just acted as coathanger while the other three went on the grand total of two rides (the only ones that werent geared toward the 4 foot and under crowd). I got some  fairly good pics of them on the first ride.    urlLink        urlLink        urlLink      (Ok, so one fairly decent pic of them, two fairly good pics of the ride  lol)  We spent a whole half hour of quality fun time at the fair and then proceeded back to the bus stop, where we waited for... over an hour for the next bus. The stop happened to be next to a building which had an overhanging roof over a porch. This was good for poor Ddee who was far too hot in a sweatshirt, in the blazing (relatively) sun.     urlLink   Andrew looks like hes got the whole ape thing goin on, but dont worry, hes just on his cell.      urlLink   If this isnt Hickville, then I dont know what...      urlLink    My question is how to get the vehicle up there to begin with. Who knows, maybe YEEHAAs 4x4 enough (man enough in the truck world)    After the bus finally got there, we had to share it with four rather intoxicated 20-some-odd year old guys who didnt seem to have a problem spreading the news that yes, you will get drunk in the beer garden.  After we got back to Portland, we ate dinner in the lower food court of Pioneer Place 2. (I wish Id gotten some pictures of that place, the fountains make it look sweet. :)  We had an uneventful bus ride back to the Washington Square (mall that we started at), and decided to browse around for a while, in search of a game for Andrews friend whos b-day party I was taking him to.    urlLink   Andrew and me in the WS Summit bathrooms... see Ddee, this has nothing to do with showers ;)    HAHAHA, somehow I lost my key to my car at the fair (at least I think I lost it at the fair), so I had to call my parents and have them come give me a spare key. Once they left, I took everyone home, well everyone but Andrew who I took to a restaurant which preceded a sleepover he was going to. He had KrispyKreme for breakfast the next day (lucky dawg).     urlLink   Is she yawning?? I cant tell.

      I didn't talk to her tonight. Well, actually it was last night, and I did talk to her, just not about that.   I got home from a *fun* day with  urlLink d'Dee ... (ok fine, Ddee) , her sister  urlLink Kristy  and  urlLink Andrew M. . Will post a TON more on that L8r, complete with some pics :)   Anyway, about Gwen: I got home from a *fun* da.... I just said that... ok moving on... Once I got home, I called her and asked if I could bring some DVDs and stuff that I had borrowed, up and she answered yes, but she seemed really tired. I drove them up and borrowed another DVD that my mom wanted (A Walk To Remember), but Gwen seemed so tired that I changed my previous plan of going back home and calling her to talk, to calling her tomorrow night.  btw, I got a messageboard up! :) Untill I set up my home-base webserver and translate my blog to that, I think this will do the job nicely. Though when I do start hosting from home, I'll get a little more elaborate.

      Listening to:  Andrew W. K. - Got To Do It   I had a long and meaningfull talk with my mom last night through this morning (Sorry Andrew, that's why I kept calling you back every half hour saying I was going to be longer - lol), and I'm feeling much better for it. She's great to talk too; it's amazing how much of this she understands. Anyway, I'm thinking (this was kinda her advice too) that I need to pull back from Gwen for a while, while this new relationship starts and give her some room to breath. I'm probably going to call her tomorrow night (well, tonight) and tell her that I know she's in a relationship with another guy now and I think I need to pull back and just let them figure each other out without my interaction as a hinderance. I'll probably finally say straight up that I'm in love with her and would be quite willing to have a closer relationship again should she so choose, but for the moment we need to tone down on how much we're communicating (i.e. I'm not going to call her every night and stay up for hours on end, talking anymore). I know that she wants to still keep our friendship alive, but I question whether our current interaction is really within the bounds of 'just a friendship'.  Feedback is more than welcome on this.

      *GRRRRAAAAAAAAAH!!!* to Comcast... my isp  (no not dialup). It cut out five minutes after I posted that last post, right when I need someone to talk too... Oh well, I just went to bed listening to  Sense Field - Save Yourself :  My self esteem, it's been low, go ahead and count it's been lower than low. / I know the feeling of it stealing life out from under me. / I want to learn, can you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you? / So many times we just give it away to someone who, couldn't even remember your name / Could you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you, loves me for me? / Give it away to someone who, someone who will cherish your name.   Hmm... speaking of music, I think I'll post some songs that I've been listening to / sing / humming / mumbling all day.  1.  AFI - This Time Imperfect    I cannot leave here.  I cannot stay. Forever haunted, more than afraid. Asphyxiate on words I would say. I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me.  I cannot stay here.  I cannot leave. Just like all I loved, I'm make-believe. Imagined heart, I disappear. Seems no one will appear here and make me real.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak.   I'd share with you, could I speak, just how much this hurts me. I'd tell you how it haunts me.   Cuts through my day and sinks into my dreams. You don't care that it haunts me.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me... just how much this hurts me...  just how much you...   2. the second half of  Drive Emerson - Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)  (the beginning has some raunchy stuff in it)   Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to He sent you from heaven Just to make my dreams come true When he opened the door That you came walking through Only God could stop me loving you  There ain't no girl In the whole wide world Could tear us apart And there ain't no man Could steal your hand And tear us apart  But there is one God, In heaven above who gave me love strong enough, to calm my heart  Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you   3. This one I heard on the radio three times today... kinda spoke to me, but I don't believe it in this case :|  Brooks Garth - Unanswered Prayers    Just the other night a hometown football game My wife and I ran into my old high school flame And as I introduced them the past came back to me And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  She was the one that I'd wanted for all times And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then I'd never ask for anything again  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams And I could tell that time had changed me In her eyes too it seemed We tried to talk about the old days There wasn't much we could recall I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  And as she walked away and I looked at my wife And then and there I thanked the good Lord For the gifts in my life  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

      Feeling: umm... there's too much emotion rolling through me to allow me to 'feel' anything for a while...  Gwen and I just conversed (how or why... it doesn't matter anymore) and in the course of our brief conversation, she told me a name: Richard. I guessed and got it right; her new boyfriend.  I think it's time to blow the dust off the old stack of emo music and wallow for a while.  "This goes out to the one I love..."  ok, while's up...  *sniff*

      wow... long time no post. I promised Laurie that I'd post something tonight (well, this morning now...) but I also just promised Gwen that I would get to bed very soon, and you know how it is with girls - just can't turn them down (well.... for most things). So, I shall be brief.  Several of my computers are up and running including my main (soon to be sub-main) Windows box, which I am currently on.  I successfully reformatted it and installed the new OS, but dling all the new drivers and patches... well that's still taking some time. I just took then case apart again today to replace the old drab green and yellow LEDS with red and blue Super-brights. Man, what a difference... those things are powerful!  I talked to Laurie on IRC earlier today for the first time in... hmm almost a week.  We agreed that I would call her at 8 my time, 9 her's, tonight but, I FORGOT MY PHONE when I went to church!!! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr* to all things regrading my memory (lol).  I'm going to the beach tomorrow, kinda against my wishes... I had thought that the trip was planned for next week, but got canceled because of VBS... oh well.   I called Gwen around 10:30 tonight and got her dad. He told me that she would call me back shortly, so I waited for... well it turned out to be 45 minutes... not untill she called me back, but untill I started thinking and realized that my phone was back in the car again!!! (after I had gotten it out of the house, after I  had forgotten it when I wanted to call Laurie... lol). I went out and checked, and sure enough, she left a voicemail 25 minutes earlier. I called her back and evidently woke up her dad, but she said it didn't matter so whatever. At one point we were talking about the terrible amount of sleep I get and she kept trying to think of ways to get me to go to bed earlier. (lol) She wanted to talk to my mom, so I gave the phone to her and they conspired (I could hear the entire conversation, and contributed to it) to set a bedtime for me and how on earth to enfoce it. My mom suggested tying me to my bed every night for several weeks untill it became habit to get to bed that early, but I thought clorephorm (spelling?) would work better. (LOL) Eventually my mom gave the phone back to me, and Gwen and I continued talking, with my mom randomly grabing the phone from me now and then and interjecting comments like, "Well, we used to tell him when he was younger that 'If he weren't so cute, he'd be in a whole lotta' trouble by now'" (HAHAHAHA) My mom's great. Gwen was laughing about that for a while. 'Ne way, I did tell her I'd get to bed soon, so I should stop talking about us talking about me getting to bed soon, and get to bed soon :)   Sleep well, my beloved ones. Sleep well.

      I think I'll post about what's been happening (not much) over the last couple days, a little later today, though I will give this free piece of adivece: Sitting infont of two computers for 10 hours straight, burning backup cds so you can format them is INCREDIBLY boring.   Another great country song:     What The World Needs - Wynonna Judd    I look around at all the faces and I see All the lonely people looking back at me Rich,poor don't matter we're all the same Everybody's hungry in a different way We're clawing and climbing and kicking and screaming And fighting but really  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  La da la da da  Sometimes all it takes is just a smile To change somebody's weather chase the clouds out of the sky Sometimes you got to give and not receive Sometimes you got to live what you believe Open your arm's 'cause that's where it starts Right here with you and me  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  Nobody likes the cold We all need someone to hold No one wants to be alone  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around (That's what the world needs now)  What the world needs now (What the world needs now is love) (Love and only love) Love and only love (A little help from up above) (A way to make a better day) Let's come together lay our prejudices down

                  HAHAHAHAHA, this is so great :) I was cruising the web earlier today and ran across  urlLink this site  on a link from another blog,  urlLink SuperfastComputer.com . It's dedicated to hosting a video growing ever more famous, called " urlLink Star Wars Kid ". The following is a quote from it:   Ghyslain, whose parents requested that his last name be withheld, is the so-called Star Wars Kid featured in a hilarious but oddly poignant video that has been downloaded more than a million times since its release to the Web in late April. In the clip, Ghyslain brandishes a golf ball retriever that serves as a double-bladed light saber, enthusiastically re-enacting a series of battle maneuvers inspired by the feats of evildoer Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace. When a group of schoolmates discovered the videotape, they put it on the Internet, and within days it was a cause celebr.  The Ghyslain clip soon caught the attention of Web bloggers Andy Baio and Jish Mukerji, who posted it to their respective sites. Its obvious comedic appeal aside, Baio recognized in Ghyslain a kindred spirit. I'm a computer programmer, and I was unpopular in high school, except for some like-minded, geeky friends, Baio said. Yes, he looks silly and awkward. But at the second level, you just identify so much.  Visitors to Baio's site, www.waxy.org, began posting comments on the video  not all of them civil.  Some of the comments were really positive. People were writing things like, I was like him in high school, Baio said. But a lot of them  a disturbing number  were incredibly mean-spirited. It made me mad. All of these people calling him fat-ass or loser, and it's completely hypocritical  I mean, all the traffic was coming from technology sites, videogame sites, and Star Wars and Star Trek sites.  So I turned off the comment function, deleted the negative comments and posted a message to the effect that You're trashing one of your own, and all you geeks and nerds and dorks need to evaluate how you're behaving.  When one of Ghyslain's schoolmates guilty of posting the video contacted Baio and mailed him the teen's contact information, Baio and Mukerji called Quebec. [Ghyslain's] initial and understandable reaction was that he was unsure of my intentions, Mukerji said. But he opened up quickly. He's an intelligent young man. He was very guarded, but by the end of the conversation, he was very jovial.  Baio and Mukerji didn't stop there. They established a Web fundraiser with the stated aim of collecting enough money to buy Ghyslain an iPod, and the response has far exceeded their expectations  as of May 19, they had amassed more than $1000, and thanks to an anonymous $500 donation, Baio expected the tally to top $2000 by the end of the day. The plan is to now buy Ghyslain his own iBook.  The video was going to spread around the Web anyway  hopefully this will help, and if nothing else, he has an iBook to keep him company, Baio said. And he also learned that geeks look out for each other.     urlLink  Sign the petition to get Ghyslain into Star Wars Episode III!

      Ok, stuff about last week that I havent yet told you: Gwens family was in California from Sunday till well, the next other Sunday. (lol)  I was taking care of her dog Rascal (a beautiful white, Golden Retriever) all week while they were away (cept the last two days when her brother whos in college was back in town). Two weeks ago, next Tuesday, I was at her house for a couple hours while they were showing me everything I needed to do. (btw, that was the day that she gave me a haircut)  For some reason they wanted to take the entire ride down to the Los Angels area (16 hour drive) in one day, so they planned to start out at 2 am. I called her at 1:30 to wake her if she wasnt already up, but she had woken a couple minutes before I called.   I went to sleep and woke up around 8, before church Rascal seemed fine so I didnt worry about her until later. After church, I went with Goodys family over to a park near their house for a family reunion thingy (no Im not part of their family technically  lol). It was so stinking hotI left their after an hour or so and went to the other side of town to another park where my dads small group (formerly also my moms) was having a picnic. Josh M, Jesh, Josiah and Emily were there, and we talked for a while. I got the opportunity to try out phones new AIM compatibility  its ok, but IT WONT SIGN OFF WHEN YOU WANT IT TO!!!  Annoying since it seems to interfere with calls and other operations. Josh, Jesh, Josiah and I stayed a while after everyone else left then went to Joshs house. On the way to Joshs I stopped at Gwens house to take care of Rascal for a while and was rather stunned to see her (Rascal, not Gwen) hanging around outside the front door At first I thought that Id been extremely negligent and not locked the gate (which I know I check before I left), so I put her back into the yard and started the other direction to go check the mail. When Rascal suddenly appeared beside me again, I decided that I could not have been stupid enough to mistake the gate being locked twice, so I started to think about it for a minute and almost immediately I noticed the sizable hole in the fence and the corresponding hole that she dug in the ground under it. After much phone conversation, we determined that I shouldnt board up the fence, only fill up the hole and that I should leave Rascal in the house during the day, not outside in the back yard. Because of this, I spent around an hour extra with her every evening just to keep her company.  Remember back in my June 22nd post, when I talked about how much of an impact Gwen has had on my life, and that Ive never told her? Well I was planning to spend a considerable amount of time every day that she was gone, writing a letter which I would leave for her, explaining all of it. I had set it as a pretty high priority in my mind - thats why I think it was by Gods hand that I did not write it It was so important to me that I do, but whenever I would sit down and start to write, I would get sidetracked or not be able to concentrate or something. Weird. Oh well, I guess Ill just have to trust Him and see what He will work through all this.  O, I wrote Gwen that email back when she was on the Canada trip (my July 8th post), and I was right (haha), she didnt check her email for almost two months. :-D Ne way, heres her reply:    armaan, you were right about my e-mail habits. i thank you for the prayer and tell your  friends thank you for me too. tell them to keep praying that what happened on  the trip would have a lasting affect on their lives. stay happy gwen   So people who were praying, be ye thanked. :)  Oh, another thing, I sent her a backward survey a long time ago and she just sent it back to me. One of the questions was do you love me? she answered as a friend and a brother in Christ. When I sent it back to her, I thought about it for a while and wrote I care about you in a way, not necessarily romantic, but still special. It made sense to me at the time, but now as I look back on it, I find myself more leaning toward the word romantic as a describer again. Hmm I dunno

        urlLink     umm...... ok..... moving on.....  Man, I've been running non-stop all week doing various things (most if not all of them fun), but have been getting very little sleep and am starting to lag behind on things that I had previously set as priorities.  On Wednesday night, our Senior Pastor was out of town, so  urlLink Pastor Bill Ritchie  from  urlLink Crossroads Community Church  came and gave a wonderful message. Man, that guy is funny. :) Probably one of the funniest this he did was call TBN the 'big hair channel'. (I'll post an audio clip of that later...) :-D He's really hard to record though; quite animated - constantly walking around the stage.  Chatting on Youthfire yesterday morning was interesting... Everyone was talking about butts from the time that I got on till a couple hours later... specifically Chelsea gawking about a pic of Phil's butt that Sam took... umm... yeah... next subject.  Youth group last night was cool, the majority of the Junior High was (is still) on an all-week campout, so it was just the 40-or-so of us Senior Highers. Everything was really impromptu. Steven and I randomly got up and led worship with Andrew (who played the guitar) then Ryan finished a series on a book title The Case For Christ. Was a pretty good book to read and study through. I'd recommend it to anyone.  Later after youth group was finished - about 9, I called Laurie again and talked to her for around ten minutes. It's kinda funny; I was running all over the place trying to help set up sound stuff for some people (Steven, Matt, Jeremy, Adam and Kelly) while talking to her. She had limited time to talk, so I handed her over to Steven after about ten minutes then they talked for... four or five minutes then he gave her back to me and we said goodbye. Haha, it was nice talking to her for more than 40 seconds this time. :)  Great "All-American" country song:    Keith Urban - Where The Blacktop Ends lyrics    Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  I'm lookin' down the barrel of Friday night Ridin' on a river of freeway lights Goodbye city I'm country bound 'Til Monday rolls around  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Workin' in the grind is an uphill road Punchin' that clock and carryin' that load I bust it all week and then I'm free The weekend belongs to me  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Give me some fresh air give me that farm Give me some time with you in my arms Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul, you betcha  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends

      Man Friday night was funny. Cameran came over and we and my sister and her friend (who also spent the night) burned and melted stuff outside for like two hours. We started creating 'pyro art' or something in the air with WD40 by catching the flame with it and moving the stream all over the place then passing the flame back and forth from person to person. Hey, did you know that melting plastic bags make a really cool 'ziiiiiiiing' sound when they drip? O, or did you know that glowsticks explode when you toss them in a fire? (LOL)  Come Saturday, Cam and I went over to the Gadeholt's house from when 'Uncle' Greg, 'Auntie' Irene, Timy and we went to Multnomah Falls (3rd highest in N. America) and climbed 8 miles from the base up to Larch Mountain. The entire assent was something like a 4,900 foot increase in elevation. The average grade of the trail we followed was 13.75%. After the fourth hour or so, Cam, Timy and I discovered that it was actually easier to run up certain parts of the trail than to walk up. :) The scenery was spectacular though - myriads of little waterfalls running down the stream on either side of the trail. At one point, we spent a good 20 minutes hurtling boulders into part of the stream... When I stopped for a moment and asked the cliff face (the direction that I was looking) why we were doing it, Uncle Greg responded "Because it's there". HAHA   Man school's backing up and I've got even more h/w than usual... have no idea why I'm even taking time to write this (lol) Goodnight.

      Man,  Lonestar - Not a Day Goes By  is such good (i.e. sad) song....   Got a picture of you I carry in my heart Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark Got a memory of you I carry in my soul I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by  I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark Wishin' you were next to me, your head against my heart If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by  Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

      Ok, well I'm still up and Ddee wanted me to post, so I think I will. Mind you though that it'll be tiny cause I'm tired and want to get to bed.  I just got back from my school's annual Fall retreat to Winema, a Christian campground on the beach. This Winema was one of many firsts for me: It was the first one I've been to as a junior. it was the first time I've been there and not climbed on, or even seen for that matter, the 60 foot tall rock on the shoreline that everyone loves. It's the first time I've felt God lead me not to get into the worship, it's the first time I've hung out with... almost every group of people for an extended period of time. It's the first time I've felt unwanted by the class above me (if only for a short while) and it's also the first time I've ever missed someone so much who was there with us the entire time.  Sometimes firsts are good, and other times...  Goodnight ... may we all die restfully in our sleep that we may escape this world and all its grief.

      No, I'm not dead, I'm still very much alive and running :) ... and actually that's exactly the problem... oh, no not the alive part, I'm refering to the running part. You see, this school year and the weeks leading up to it have proven to be the busiest I've ever had. With all the homework and other activities I have going, this is the first time I've even gotten on the web recreationally, in... 5 days... yeah that sounds about right. The only reason I'm posting is I may not have time to email Laurie back, replying to her voicemail(s) ~lol~ earlier and I wanted to get through to her that I had gotten them, if for some unforseen reason I could not call her back tomorrow. Incidently, those voicemails only became voicemails because my STUPID PHONE DECIDED TO DIE ON ME EARLIER TODAY!!! (Don't worry it's better now, but the battery still has issues.) Anyway, I have no idea how frequently I will be able to keep posting for a while, but let me assure you that I haven't forgotten about all ya`   I miss yah all you Youthfire'ers, hopefully will chat again soon!  ~Armaan_running

      CAM'S NOT MOVING!!! The company his dad applied for already found someone for the job! :) Sweetness.  This Friday, Andrew and I are prolly staying over night at Cam's then we're all going back over to Andrew's ... not sure what we're gonna do to fill the time but it should be interesting.   I'm really sucking at school right now... Calc. and Spanish are still Fs and Sign's starting to head down that way too... I have had so many phreaking 1st period tardies that every time I'm tardy do, I get ISS (LOL). Thankfully it's only once a week, but still ... crazy. I keep missing key days in Chemistry so I'm behind in that right now too... not sure what I'm going to do... My uncle's thinking it might be best to drop Calc. do preCalc for another year, but that would seriously screw with my class lineup... not something I'm hoping for.   Anyway, I've got a paper that's worth 16 grades due in Senior English tomorrow, so I'd better get going... not sure if I'm gonna be on tonight, but whatever...  O, btw I'm going to a opera on Nov. 6th with a group that Rachaels' (am I spelling your name correctly?) conveniently a part of (thankyouthankyou now Im not going to be stuck with just 9 middle schoolers - nothing against them as a whole... just this particular bunch can be sometimes rather ... annoying). I've invited Cam and Ddee too, and I might even be able to get Josh to go along, but so far only Cam and Ddee are showing interest. (Andrew, wanna get some culture? WELL THEN STAY AT HOME WHILE THE REST OF US GO TO THE OPERA!!! ... jk jk, but I really doubt that would be your 'cup of tea')

      Man, I'm dying daily untill Friday.... This is going to suck soooo bad if Cam's moving. God...   to all the people who don't already know: Cam's dad's all excited about a potential job offer that would relocate his family to Texas... They were originally going to know today whether he got it or not, but the date's been moved to Friday. His mind seems to be made up: he gets the position and they're moving. It'll prolly take like two months to get ready and stuff, but then again there's no guarantee that they'll even be here for Thanksgiving.  holy crap, this is going to suck...

      I'm tired and ned to do some homework, clean my room and practice piano, but I'm going to Ddee's office in a minute for a bible study so I guess that'll all have to wait until I get back.   I'm reather unhappy about some of the scores I've been getting in subjects at school, particularly Spanish and AP Calc. I got flippin' 48% on my last Spanish test! 'Course it doesn't help that I didn't study anywhere near enough for it (lol). Oh, and I've already gotten ISS (In School Suspension) for tardies this early into the year. I drop my sister off at her school before I get to mine almost every morning, but her school's really weird about their closed campus policies. They won't even let her get out of the car until one of the staff opens the door for her. It's sooo stupid and it's costing my my GPA (ISS means less time in the class, which means less time learning).   Oh well, I'd better head over to Portline. See yah'all later~

      Grrr.... annoyance of annoyances - I'm borrowing Brady's iPod, uploading a ton of music on it, and copying it all onto Andrew H's computer, but things are being temperamental... First, the iPod was formatted using the newer Mac filing system which is all well and good when listening to music or syncing to a Mac, but I happen to be an all-pc guy (hope to change that soon) and so does Andrew H. It seemed that the only thing to do was to reformat the iPod with a FAT32 filing system and reload the OS. I was reluctant to do that because I wanted to upload some of Brady's music onto my computer as well, and reformatting it obviously erases all the data, so that wouldn't work. I started experimenting with random pc-based apps that allow communication with Mac formatted media. Finding little to no success in this, I was about to give up until I found Xplay, the app that made iPods for pc uses possible when the only format you could encode an iPod in was Mac. I installed that, but unfortunately, there was a data transfer problem in which the entire computer would lockup and eventually bluescreen. I retried this approach twice, but decided to discard since I was getting nowhere fast. I downloaded iPod OS 2.1 and used the installed to reformat the iPod. This took substantially less time that I had expected and I figured I was home free from this point on. Not so. My firewire port was evidently messed up, more often than not, it would only allow a small portion of a song to transfer before giving me some type of error message. I eventually gave up on that and decided to switch to usb, but that had its own complications: first, the high-speed (usb 2.0) controller wasnt loaded, so the connection was heinously slow. Second, the usb port does not power the iPod, but the firewire does, so I had to concoct an elaborate set of steps in order to reconnect the iPod whenever I wanted to transfer something: plug in the firewire, take five minutes (because the comp. kept freezing during this time) to disable it, and then plug in the usb and hope that everything worked. If not, I would have to restart the iPod and sometimes manually power down the entire computer and restart it.

      LOL, this is funny:  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=thefirebreathes.blogspot.com  (it may take a while to render though...)  you can browse almost any site like this, simple add  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  before the rest of the ULR. For instance, if you wanted to browse www.yahoo.com in ... color ... (lol), you'd take the  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  and add  yahoo.com  to form  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=yahoo.com   This seems to work for all html-based websites exept for a few notible ones (like  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=google.com ) that happen to have a different default language than http://www.malfunction.org/ 's and display the page in German among other things.

       http://www.patchdayreview.com/   (Info on Microsoft patches) When checking on the latest patches from Microsoft, I sometimes feel like I spend too much time translating the gibberish to see if I need the patch or not. Yes, even I have trouble understanding some of its contents. Bad, eh? PatchDayReview aims to explain Microsoft's patches in English. Plus, it has a thermometer next to each patch identifying the urgency (critical, important, moderate, or low) needed to implement the patch. The site uses mild bad language.

Its an interesting concept: imagine you're checking someone's blog at school or at work and your teacher / manager / any person you don't want to see the site walks up. With this tool you can simply click a link and immediately go to a website or application of your choice. The link  urlLink    is customizable, via a cookie that you can obtain from Gary (the creator)'s  site . My and Steven's redirection site of choice is  this .

      Listening to:  Offspring - Something To Believe In  Feeling: cheerful, happy  LOL My friend in English got a text message from his girlfriend at Jesuit that it was snowing, and the entire school was in an uproar in under an hour... a big group of people were going on a leadership retreat to the coast and if it's snowing down here it's bad news for a bus full of people crossing the Cascades. They were going to leave after school, but they decided to leave at noon to try and make it through the pass before they were snowed in.   Attendance has been down since Monday on account of random illnesses. In Calc today, we had three people. (lol) I love that class even though I currently suck at it. I've been thinking that I need to be tutored in order to get out of the rut that I'm in in that class, but the more I contemplate it, I realize that I just need to take it more seriously. If I spent half the time on hw for it that I did on this computer... dang.  Btw, I'm going to try to start posting more regularly now: every day, and prolly will start using this for more of a personal itinerary blog and journal than a diary. Most of my old posts were me pouring my heart out and everything, but I've got way too many people checking this thing now to be safe using it for that LOL  'Ne wayz, Ben's coming over in a few, so I need to go give my room some attention.

      Now that we've all had a day to think about it, and had some second opinions from a mechanic and such, it's starting to look like the entire accident wasn't my fault. First of all, the damage to my car shows that the max speed I could have been going was 5 mph. Also, in an intersection (like that one) that has no markings (stop signs etc...) the right of way always goes to the person on the right.  I was on the right.

      Ok, so I'm driving from the far side of Movies on TV (a theater, whose name is a spoof on the highway it borders - Tualatin Valley, or TV Highway) parking lot, toward one of three entrances, intent on exiting the property, when ahead of me, from my left, a Camry drives into view behind a blind corner (blind, only by the cars parked at it, not by nature of the corner itself). We are quite close to each other, each of us moving at a fairly rapid pace for a parking lot, but I do have just enough distance to stop and clear them if I slam on the brakes. Now, my brakes are of an odd sort - to begin with they're in a '92 Corolla, so anti-lock is not a possibility (or at least, not much of one). Second, even though they are quite powerful (I have come to a dead stop, decelerating from 55 mph in under 3 seconds on at least one occasion), the position of the petal is rather obscure. The accelerator, in perspective to the brake, is recessed almost two (maybe more, not quite sure now actually) inches. Furthermore, the width of clearance between the brake and the wall or sorts to the right of the gas is almost identical to that of my shoes. Ok, now back to the story: Bearing all of this is mind, its easier to understand how, when I try to rapidly transition from gas to brake, my foot becomes stuck underneath the brake petal and when I floor what I think is the brake, Im actually swiftly accelerating. Now, Im sure the outcome of this petal orientation issue is readily apparent, so it goes almost without saying that I strike the Camry, even while attempting to swerve out of the way. What is not readily apparent though is that the damage that occurs to my left, front wheel upon impact jams it into a hard-right turn and sends me careening straight at a parked month-old Lancer. Thankfully, there is a small curb and sidewalk between my still accelerating car (foot stuck behind brake petal, remember?) and the shiny new, well-into-the-five-digit costing vehicle in front of me, that manages to catch my right wheel (the only one at this point free to steer) and allows me to narrowly miss totaling the Lancer, and instead simply remove the right rear tail light. By the time I am nearly passing the object which turned this into a three car accident, I have managed to disentangle my foot and sharply apply my brake little good that it did with my left wheel banking sharply against the other three though.   All in all, the entire left side of my car is heavily marred, the driver door is bent, the left front wheel's hydraulics are destroyed (estimated $400 repair), and the right front bumper is imploded. The Camry got most of the body in front of the engine removed, and the top of the right wheel well is pretty much gone too. The Lancer had the most minimal damage, but possibly the most costly, seeing as it's less than a frigin' month old.

      HAHAHA, let's all thank Ddee for this ... interesting email:   In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft Error messages with Haiku poetry messages. Haiku poetry has strict construction rules. Each poem has only three lines, 17 syllables: five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, five in the third.   Haikus are used to communicate a timeless message often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight through extreme brevity  the essence of Zen:   Your file was so big.  It might be very useful.  But now it is gone.   The Web site you seek  Cannot be located, but  Countless more exist.   Chaos reigns within.  Reflect, repent, and reboot.  Order shall return.   Program aborting:  Close all that you have worked on.  You ask far too much.   Windows NT crashed.  I am the Blue Screen of Death.  No one hears your screams.   Yesterday it worked.  Today it is not working.  Windows is like that.   First snow, then silence.  This thousand-dollar screen dies  So beautifully.   With searching comes loss  And the presence of absence:  "My Novel" not found.   The Tao that is seen  Is not the true Tao-until  You bring fresh toner.   Stay the patient course.  Of little worth is your ire.  The network is down.   A crash reduces  Your expensive computer  To a simple stone.   Three things are certain:  Death, taxes and lost data.  Guess which has occurred.   You step in the stream,  But the water has moved on.  This page is not here.   Out of memory.  We wish to hold the whole sky,  But we never will.   Having been erased,  The document you're seeking  Must now be retyped.   Serious error.  All shortcuts have disappeared.  Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

      On the  Matrix, Revolutions : (a portion of a  review from MSNBC.com ) "theres still too much dialogue that comes from the wherever you go, there you are school of circuitous profundity."   Ever since the disappointment of Reloaded, theres been some question as to whether it was a good idea to spring another Matrix installment on moviegoers within the same calendar year. Remember what happened to Back to the Future 3, released just a few months after Back to the Future 2? It faded so quickly that most fans of the original didnt even realize the series had switched genres, from time-travel fantasy to full-scale Western.  Nevertheless, the third installment in the Matrix trilogy is already here, and there is no genre-switching. Alas. Once more, Neo the potential messiah (Keanu Reeves) is joined by his main squeeze Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and the fatherly Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to do battle with a software-created world and the shape-shifting malevolence of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).     Once more there are multiple Smiths (and Weavings), and theyve taken over the body of Neos schizzy shipmate, Bane (Ian Bliss). The reluctant Frenchman Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) is persuaded to help out, while The Oracle, chain-smoking dispenser of cookies and fortune-cookie wisdom, turns up in the shape of Mary Alice. (The late Gloria Foster played her in the first two films, and the change is cutely acknowledged.)  Unlike Reloaded, this new Matrix doesnt leave the audience hanging in mid-narrative. Producer Joel Silver claims this really is the end, even if the finale does hint at more installments to come. But Revolutions still makes most of the same mistakes as Reloaded.   The Wachowskis, Andy and Larry, replace clever plotting with furious action, then substitute massive sets and special effects for character development. And theres still too much dialogue that comes from the wherever you go, there you are school of circuitous profundity.   Under the circumstances, the actors can do little but stay out of the way of the heavy machinery  which includes a ferocious drill that breaks through Neos pals defenses and threatens to wipe out the human race. Theres a Star Trek cheesiness about too many of the performances; the romantic chemistry between Reeves and Moss has never been harder to buy.  A few touches surprise: an impromptu trip through a packed disco, the brutal exit of one major character, and a subway stop that operates on principles similar to Harry Potters train station. Neo finds himself stranded in this purgatory, punished by a grotesque creature who thinks hes God and wont let him leave.  OK, you got yourself in here, says Neo to himself. You can get yourself out. The way Reeves says it, he might be thinking about his career.

      I don't know how this is going to work... I get too attached to things and its sooo hard to let go. Whats happening now is that theres a very high possibility that Im going to be switching schools within the coming weeks. I cant function at mine right now; its becoming more and more apparent the more research we do, that Ive got a rather severe form of ADD thats really effecting my ability to learn at Faith. Im really saddened by the prospect because Ive got some wonderful friends there, and not to say that Ill be losing those friends automatically when I leave, its just going to be a huge amount harder There is one bright side to all this though the school that I might be transferring to is Beaverton High, Stevens school.

      Listening to: The Ataris  Boys of Summer  Saturday, I was really depressed all day long and for some reason, didnt sleep at all that night. I read Stevens blog at something like 5am and in it he said that he was prolly pulling an all-nighter, and sure enough, he was on aim, so we talked for a couple hours. He bailed though and slept through church (lol). I got back home and slept from 2pm till past 7:30pm. At something like 8:30, someone knocked at my door, and assuming it was my sister (who was currently being hyper with three equally hyper friends), I opened it. It turned out to be Adri who was returning my overcoat that I had left at her house last week. Eventually we (Melissa too, who was with Adri) went over to Joshs house from some reason, picked him up and went to the Gadeholts. We stayed there for a bit then visited Christine the restaurant where she works, visited Joshs brother at his work, and went to Starbucks. We went back to Adris house with our drinks and ice cream (obtained from the restaurant) in tow, but left again because we didnt want to wake up her parents with all our noise. We went back to the Gadeholts house (Christine was off work by this time) and ate our ice cream and such Since it was approaching midnight, we decided to get back to our houses, and on the way back to mine, we noticed that the snow that had been falling all night was finally sticking :) (lol - awesomeness). Once Adri and Melissa (who was staying at Adris) got back home, they called me and we talked for 3 hours and 20-something minutes (lol).   I woke up just before noon today and got ready to go out to lunch with my grandparents. Before we got there though, we stopped at a couple random parking lots Southridge etc and did some power-driving on the slick roadways. Man, thats a nice VW that they have :). We went out for lunch, went back to house, and Ralph and I took off to go get me some experience driving a manual transmission on slick roads. Turns out that Im too big for the drivers seat of his truck (lol  annoying non-moving steering column).

And this wall is so much stronger, Than everything that I've seen before.   In your eyes, I see flowers and trees.  In your eyes, I see beautiful things I can't believe.  Cause in your eyes I see the love that shine on me.  In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes.  I see the blue skies bring some rain I feel the blood rush in my veins I never want to see you cry. Recently you said good night, Did not believe it for a while But you really meant goodbye.  In your eyes I see the sun shine.  It's so bright that I can't see.  And this wall is so much stronger,  Than everything that I've seen before.   Well, have a Merry Christmas and such! Im off to hear my moms concert and then to my grandmas house to have a little family get-together.

      Well, I guess I should write a bit about the last few days, so here goes:  On Friday, before I even left school, Cam, Xbox in tow, got to my house. I joined him shortly (lol) and he gave me a pair of gay, see-through, Santa Claus boxers (LOL). Andrew arrived with his Xbox and TV around 7 that night and we set about setting the three consoles up, interconnected via my home network. We did random stuff including watching several movies until Andrew and I finally bedded down close to 6am (Cam had taken shelter and fallen asleep in our large unfinished basement / storage area adjacent to my room back at 3am.  Cam woke up at 8 and finally got me up at 10:30. We both then dragged Andrew out of the storage area, into my room where he refused to actually get up till past 11 (lol). Ddee, Kristy, and Brady got to my house just past noon and we all waited with baited breath (er, no) for everyone else to arrive at 1:30. In all, the attendees were Cam, Andrew, Brady, Kristy, Ddee, Vlad, both Katies, Kelli, Steven, Brandon, Josh, Jennifer, Adri, Melissa, Kat, Becky, Mandy, Danie, Lisa, Young Hee, my family and me. We did so many random things over the course of the afternoon that I can barely remember specifics. When my parents finally got home (a couple hours late) with the pizzas etc, we started planning how we were going to get over to Zoo Lights. Eventually, everyone who was coming had a ride figured out, and it ended up that Steven, Adri and I were all riding with Brady.   We had fun at Zoo Lights. We rode the train, admired the lights shining through the mist ( fog whatever), group hugged random people dressed up as animals you know, same ol, same ol. Most of us stopped for Coffee at Starbucks on the way back Adri and Steven got into some type of signing war, er, I dont know what was going on (lol). Anyway, once we got back home, almost everyone had left, save Steven and Brady (who were staying the night) and Adri, Melissa and Katie. Adri stayed a while after even after Katie and Melissa left  that was cool, we all talked for a while. Right after she left (past 12) we went down to Stevens house and grabbed his computer paraphernalia. Later, Steven Brady and I pulled one of the servers out of the garage, and worked for a few hours, but got almost nothing accomplished except for downloading a few drivers onto my computer. We went to sleep close to 3:30 (or at least I did)  [Um Its like what? 1:22am, and Brent just called me and asked if I had my car. Im like Nooo why?, and hes all Ok, talk to you later then, bye.  strange kid (LOL)]   Anyway, We woke up the next morning somewhere between 10am and 1pm (dont remember) and spent all the time working on the server and copying files back and for between Stevens and my computer. We called and told Adri that wed be at her part like an hour and a half early, but we sorta lagged behind and got there within 15 minutes of 5, the official start. We brought my Xbox but didnt set it up until an hour later when Brady, Steven and I went back to my house and grabbed a TV. Later, Melissa and I went out to exchange the dvd that Adri had rented (the Ring) because it was horribly scratched. That was annoying because they didnt have another dvd edition in stock, so we had to settle for a vhs. I heard that Brady kinda made a fool out of himself while I was gone, and I kinda noticed it a bit when I got back too. He just gets too [Insert lengthy, complete silence as all who know, contemplate how to describe it] ...in a big group of people. WhateverOh, incidentally, Gwen was there and brought Richard, who I finally got to meet (well see is the more appropriate word there was no meeting involved). Once they left, I was like, holy crap, now I can act normal again.  Steven stayed the next night again and came with us to a dinner at Madison House, a division of Good Samaritan ministries. We found a ton of Linux stuff on the fourth floor and a collection of something like a thousand Star Trek movies (and episodes on tape) in a movie room on the first floor.

      At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon." In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating the following.  If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:  1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day.  2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car.  3.  Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart, and drive on.  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to re-install the engine.  5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought "Car95" or "CarNT". But, then you would have to buy more seats.  6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads.  7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single "general car fault" warning light.  8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.  9. The airbag system would say "Are you sure?" before going off.  10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.  11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Dept.  12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.  13. You'd press the "Start" button to shut off the engine.   found at  http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasaunde/if_gm_built_cars___.htm

      Steven and I are working on those servers currently. We found we're lacking something called a Smart Start CD for configureing the SCSI arrays... we might be able to find an iso that works but itls highly doubtful.... We may have to shell out $22 for buying it off the Compaq site.

      I got this in an email from ddee. It can be found at  http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/physics.asp  I'm currently printing multiple copies of it and plan on handing them out tomorrow at school. (LOL)   The Physics of Santa and His Reindeer  No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.   There are two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't appear to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total  378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each.   Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second.   This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.   This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.   If every one of the 91.8 million homes with good children were to put out a single chocolate chip cookie and an 8 ounce glass of 2% milk, the total calories (needless to say other vitamins and minerals) would be approximately 225 calories (100 for the cookie, give or take, and 125 for the milk, give or take). Multiplying the number of calories per house by the number of homes (225 x 91.8 x 1000000), we get the total number of calories Santa consumes that night, which is 20,655,000,000 calories. To break it down further, 1 pound is equal to 3500 calories. Dividing our total number of calories by the number of calories in a pound (20655000000/3500) and we get the number of pounds Santa gains, 5901428.6, which is 2950.7 tons.   The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see above) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload (not even counting the weight of the sleigh) - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each.   In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.   In conclusion: If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.

      Well, we went and saw LotR: RofK today at 8:00 pm (well... no, yesterday since it's past midnight... which also means I'M 17! *yay*) I must say that it's done much better than I thought it would be. They did an amazing job of compressing the vast majority of the major plot twists and turns into a three-hour time frame.   I need to go to bed... adios

      Yesterday evening, I went to my school's Christmas program and stayed for the full 90 or so minutes of it. That was pretty cool... there was one part where all the lights were turned off except a powerful black light in the middle of the stage, and people signed a song wearing black clothes with white gloves, so all you could really see were their hands.   Afterward, Adrie and I went to my youth group (there was still a half-hour or something left). It was the first time I've been there in over a month. Steven (not Sus, a youth leader) was talking about how we can still honor God in Christmas celebration by making the whole thing about Him, even though almost every symbol of the holiday and the holiday itself has pagan roots. Later Melissa and Gwen came for some reason... that was um... awkward... yeah  Anyway, Adrie, Steven and I eventually went back with Ben to his house for a bit to see his newly painted room. It's really cool - the wall that his organ sits against has a red sun painted on it such that the organ's in the center of the sun and rays of red shoot out across a yellow and orange sky. It looks really cool.

      Well, I woke up at 6:30 to my cell phone's alarm, turned it off, and went straight back to bed. The next time I remember waking up was after 8:30 and all I remember about that was having a terrible headache, congestion and nausea. ... Wonderful.... Now after eating breakfast at 12:30 and drinking a phreaking ton of water, I feel much better, but I'm still not completely over the headache.   Odd.

      Music Mood:  the Offspring - Denial, Revisited   So, yeah my dad surprised me with a new car a couple days ago... that was really nice of him. (New means new to me, not actually new.) It's a '95 Toyota Camry LE. It's the newer body style (a plus over the other one), it's got like, one tiny scratch, it drives great and it's just all around a wonderful car... Except for one fatal flaw... It stinks of cig smoke. Yeah, it sux bad... that stuff doesn't come out ever, oh you can clean the interior as well as you want, but leave it out in the sun long on a hot day and that smell will come seeping out of the metal in the roof and make the car reek again. Trouble is that among my dad's slowly failing senses, he's partially lost his sense of smell so he doesnt know how bad it really is. Plus the fact that he's the type of guy that won't believe that there's a hole in the middle of the road ahead of him until he slides right into it himself, so we can tell him all we want that the smell's not coming out and he's gonna try to get it out anyway. I feel really bad about pressing the issue because whenever I talked about the other car, I was almost always complaining (And very justifiably, that car had a butt load of problems), but he spent like, 5 hours at the dealer's auction just to get this car for me and I want to show my appreciation for that. But then again as Andrew aptly said, I "won't ever have to smoke, just keep the car for two years and it'll do the same thing."  Ah the problems of life...

      What I meant in my rather abrupt post earlier is that people around me for some reason try and find something wrong with someone, create a bandwagon, try to drag as many people onto it as they can, then set out to run over the person. It happens all too frequently... First the thing with Brady and the Rivas' .... I DON'T CARE WHO'S ****ING FAULT IT IS... GET OVER IT. (I know almost everyone has by now, but there are the lingering few). And then the stint with Cameran right after that... so he decides to try and get from all the emotional politics for a bit... big deal.   But what really honestly ticks me off is all the little bickering and nitpicking that goes on between people WHO'VE NEVER EVEN MET FACE TO FACE.... for God's sake... I mean, get a life... there are better issues to get bent out of shape about than your suddenly loosing your 73rd online friend because your 21st IMed them behind your proverbial back and they both decided they didn't like you.   Becky, you're right about people (including me) not helping at all by posting demeaning things or leaving demeaning comments on other's blogs, but I still think you could've been a little more tactful with the posting of your little altered poem there. You're right about it being your journal, diary, whatever, but it's also been transformed into a means of communication to other people simply by virtue of its being accessible to essentially all humanity. Because of this fact, we have an obligation to censor our blogs to some extent to protect others and ourselves.

      Current Music:  Nina Gordon - Tonight and the Rest of My Life   Well, here I am nearly at 2:00am... on a school night... again... I've been finding myself doing this a lot lately and I think I've finally figured out why I deprive myself of sleep so often: I don't want to think. When I go to bed, I simply lie there, sometimes for hours, and over analyze every situation from my past or possibilities in the future that I can think of. I'll critique myself over and over again, sometimes focusing for days at a time on the same random event in my past that for some reason has been brought to mind. It's maddening to say the least. I feel like I'm slowly... every so slowly, going insane.  In related news, it would seem that my attention issues are getting steadily worse. I'm prolly going to have to forgo OMTA syllabus this year since I can't get my act together and practice regularly. This saying nothing about my completely failing my junior year... yeah, ain't life jolly?  Oh, one major point of happiness at the moment is that my school's Winter Banquette got cancelled because of the ice, so... I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER ALL!!!! *dances around*  ...We really should get a band of people together and rent a limo...  O, and there was one other thing that had me pretty happy today but I won't go into it.  And rest assured that I'm working hard to get the hundred or so pics from Vegas up, but it's turning out to be an undertaking of some proportion trying to find the names of all the different $20,000 - $160,000 speakers that I took pics of.  Pics that I've uploaded so far can be found  here .  Appendum: I just read Steven's latest post about not being motivated to do anything, even stuff that he wants to do, so I decided to add this to mine as well: I think that's also a major issue (dang I need a calculator to count all my issues now...) that I'm facing... I'll come home from school and simply sit around, not doing anything... no coding, no reading (I used to LOOOOOOVE reading), no random computer stuff.. I don't really even want to get into bed... I just sorta lose my will to do anything at all and just sit there... and sit there...   God I need help...

      Well, we drove through 160 miles of fog so dense, visibility was limited at times to less than 50 feet We hit a freak patch of ice, spun around more than two times while sailing over 100 feet across the freeway, hit a snow bank going backwards and ricocheted around before coming to a stop. Total damage to vehicle: Were still trying to find the damage we cant see any. Then, we drove another 30+ miles over icy roads and finally got back home. Oh, and that was all just this morning between 1 and 4 am.

      Good God, I hesitate to even post this, but... it must be done...  Gene Ray, a (to quote  urlLink Waxy.org ) "highly entertaining nutcase", says that there are four different simultaneous days within a single rotation of earth, and if you laugh at this, "you're stupid and evil and deserve to be spit on publicly." Before reading on, let me caution you by saying that anything within your reach while reading this article, is not safe: uncontrollable urges to destroy your monitor may follow.... That having been said, let me introduce his profound () ideology by quoting the first sentence on his site:     Creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days, within a single rotation of Earth, empowers me above all 1-day gods and educated stupid scientists. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.   He continues with another onslaught of wordy blather that, when sifted through, leaves him calling himself schizophrenic (which he misspells) and youthful, claiming to be above the "Wise Men" because of his establishing a "Chair of Wisdom", and goes on to curse Tom Green of all people, claiming him to be evil...  And that's just the next three sentences...  From  urlLink here  you can download his  urlLink interview  on TechTV, and if you really insist on torturing yourself, his homepage is  urlLink here   O, and I think he's watched a bit too much Peter Pan:  "Unless the children organize into a powerful force to stop the adult ramsacking of Nature, they must now prepare for the coming adult inflicted hell on Earth.

      Enter   urlLink Earthstation 5 . You remember them don't you? The peer-to-peer software developer, hosted in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, that  declared war  on the entertainment industry and told them to "f*** off"? Well, seems they've grown a bit... In the occupied Palestinian territories, says Steve Taylor, a spokesman, Earth Station 5 is safe from the music and film industries' campaign to stop people sharing content for free. At any one time, claims Mr Taylor, almost 19m people are using Earth Station 5, most in non-English-speaking countries. If true, that would make it the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing portal in the world. At the moment, everything is free on the platform, and it has no advertising. According to Mr Taylor, its backers are spending $2million a month with little if any revenue coming in. Eventually, their plan is to make money from online gambling, sports betting and ads. Well, maybe. But almost everything about Earth Station 5 may be fiction. Perhaps the only certain thing is that, at least for  urlLink The Economist , "it works."  portions of this post taken from  urlLink The Economist    In other news, even Iraqis like Counterstrike  (pictures from LAN cafes in Iraq)

      What to say about the last week... well, let's start with the physical: it's been snowy... and icy... and snowy... and icy....  yeah that's about it... school closures all around, though the roads are still somewhat drivable (I was out all day yesterday, cutting cookies in parking lots and driving up insanely steep, long hills (Im talking 500 foot elevation changes and 13.5% grade)  4-wheel drive is useful at times  In related news, all flights to and from PDX (Portland International Airport) have been grounded throughout the day, so the possibility of us getting in the air on time tomorrow is pretty grim. We were considering driving, but my dads against that. (Apparently hes not like Jon Marks family who drove 5 hours to a relatives, house I think grandparents, stayed a couple hours, and drove all the way back in the first day of Winter Break  lol)  *edit* he just called the airline and found out that our flight's still scheduled for tomorrow... so that shouldn't be a problem.  Friday  Saturday I had my big slumber LAN party thing. Half of the people thought it was a b-day party and half didnt so we got a cake and called it a sorta b-day party. Twas funny. Goody, David, Cam and Matt R. couldnt come I was kinda bummed about that. Cam didnt come cause he didnt have a ride, Matt didnt come because he was sick, and Im still not sure why Goody and David didnt come. Somehow or other, Goody heard about the party I had for friends from school and stuff and the surrounding three (LOL) sleepovers and I think was bummed that he wasnt invited. Looking back on it, I really should have invited him, but I was trying to keep the amount of people down at the party, and I was afraid that if I invited even one more person from Calvary, that I was going to have to invite everyone and that would have been something like 60 people from both school and church. Ah well, whats done is done.  Anyway, the party was great my tv gave up the ghost a few days ahead of time *stupid piece a ....*. Amidst the gaming consoles and general nerd-dom, we had boxing, wrestling, fast paced games of Cranium (wait, were heading back into the nerdness, arent we) lol

       urlLink www.naplesnews.com   Royal Phil's concert marked by conductor's solo encore  By PEG GOLDBERG LONGSTRETH, Special to the Daily News  February 13, 2004    Wednesday evening's standing-room-only concert at the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, turned out to be notable, not for the concert, featuring the world renowned Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but for the encore performance of its highly touted young conductor.   Daniele Gatti, the Royal Philharmonic's music director since 1996 and also the music director at the Teatro Communale in Bologna, returned to the stage following a standing ovation at the conclusion of Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony to - I thought mistakenly - acknowledge the accolades of the audience.   Instead, this incredibly rude, ill-mannered, churlish, boorish young conductor, tripped over his enormous ego and, in the process, managed to insult and alienate an entire, enthusiastic, respectful audience who had paid nearly $100 a ticket for the evening.  He returned to lecture the audience.   In so doing he confirmed my growing suspicions of his conduct during the evening: Maestro Gatti is a graduate of the Bobby Knight School of Social Diplomacy.   That's right. Gatti, without benefit of a microphone and with a heavy Italian accent, let everyone in the hall know ... know what, exactly? I am going to paraphrase his comments, but I believe he essentially said the following, since others, including Myra Daniels, the president and CEO of the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, with whom I spoke Thursday morning, have confirmed my interpretation of Gatti's comments:  The Royal Philharmonic is an important, world-class orchestra. They have performed all over the world. For the past two weeks they have played nonstop performances. They have never played under such trying circumstances.   Gatti went on:  The Phil's acoustics suck. The stage sucks. The placement of his orchestra on stage sucked.  While trying to make out his comments, I glanced up at Daniels' box, fully expecting to see her stand and fall over the balcony in shock.   I am certain any number of pacemakers in the decidedly older audience  went into overdrive, as person after person reacted with shock.  A number of persons in the audience made the mistake of tittering, not certain what he was saying or why smoke was coming from his ears. He stopped the laughter dead in its tracks, said, "This is no joke. I am very serious," and a hush came over the audience.   His tirade over, he exited, as did, finally, the members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra who, prior to last evening, had performed here on three other occasions since Gatti's appointment in 1996.   People who had heard right were shocked and outraged. A number of them sought out the ushers to voice their outrage over Gatti's conduct. People stopped me and were calling Thursday morning to ask if I had ever seen anything like that.   One woman called Daniels to comment: "We honored him with applause and a standing ovation, and he told us we were idiots."   Many asked, rightly so, if there were a problem with the acoustics or the stage, what the audience was supposed to do about it?   Indeed.   Reflecting back, I should have known it was going to be a strange evening. There were hints - a portent, as it turns out, of things to come: Gatti failed to utter a simple sentence at the beginning of the concert, informing concertgoers the order of presentation was being switched, which left more than half the audience sitting through the entire first number (which was supposed to be Saint Saen's Cello Concerto) wondering where the cellist was.   In fact, the first hint Gatti was not a happy camper occurred when, at the conclusion of the first movement of the first number, many people in the audience committed a mortal sin: They applauded.   Let's face it. Applause between movements is considered a sign of ignorance and poor breeding by many music snobs. There is nothing unique about music audiences in Naples applauding, as opposed to the rest of the world. They do it everywhere. Even in New York.   OK, so it would be preferable if they hired someone to come out with an applause card, to eliminate any uncertainty about when it is all right to express enthusiasm at a classical concert.   But in the greater scheme of things, given so little to applaud in today's world, is this really worth getting your dander up? Wouldn't you rather they applaud at an inopportune moment rather than boo?   But that wasn't bad enough in Gatti's eyes: At the same time, at the conclusion of that movement, in accordance with the Phil's policy, an usher quietly seated six adults on the far right side of the auditorium. They created no disturbance whatsoever, nor is there anything unusual about such a seating policy.   Gatti chose that precise moment to turn toward them, fix them with his best Bobby Knight stare - you know the look: the one where the general faces you with his best stare, utters not a single word and, in the process, strikes terror in your heart - and waited until they had been seated to proceed with the second movement.   By now, everyone in the hall had turned to see what the "problem" was, when their seating otherwise would not have been noticed by 95 percent of the auditorium.   Believe me, no one applauded during the remainder of movements in the evening's three numbers. Gatti, without ever saying a word or turning to acknowledge the existence of the audience, anticipated the possible applause and shushed them with a hand movement behind his back.   In the midst of all these by now cumulative little signs the maestro was having a bad hair day of monumental proportions, he briefly stopped the performance of Beethoven's "Eroica," turned toward the concertmistress, glowered, and the entire violin section got up and physically closed ranks, moving so close to the edge of the stage, the hapless fifth violinist had to grab his chair as it toppled off the stage.   That said, I am going to sum up the concert by saying it was very good. I am going to tell you the audience was attentive, polite and enthusiastic following the conclusion of each number. I am going to tell you Silvia Chiesa, a passionate young cellist with whom I frankly was unfamiliar, gave a solid performance during the Saint-Saens piece, and I hope we have the opportunity to hear her perform again under less stressful circumstances.   Then I am going to tell you, since so many people have called to ask if I have ever seen anything like what happened last evening, that I have not.   I have seen many gaffes and disasters on stage or during performances in my lifetime:  I have seen children wet themselves during their student recital; a graduate student in voice (whom I was accompanying) suddenly vomit all over everything during her doctoral recital; an organ short out and go totally silent during the procession of an ultra-socialite's wedding. I have seen parts break or fall off instruments. Reeds split. Strings break. Professionals forget their parts and flee the stage. I have seen musicians topple off stage; chairs break; batons suddenly take leave and fly through the air.   But until Wednesday, I have never seen a highly touted, internationally much heralded conductor blow his stack, come back on stage following a standing ovation and berate the audience. Gatti could not be reached for comment on Thursday. In the midst of all this post-concert shock and outrage, I had a sudden epiphany: In the five-plus years since my husband and I relocated to Naples, we always continued to think of Indiana and its musical venues as home.   Wednesday night I became a full-fledged Neapolitan, proud of the wonderful Philharmonic Center for the Arts, proud of the tremendous growth its orchestra has exhibited since we moved here. Thrilled with many of its world-class guest performers, of all the musical riches this community offers. And in the process, I was ready to do battle with this  pretentious, angry little twit who ruined a wonderful evening of music for many of the  concertgoers.   He was unhappy with the setting? It was beneath him?   I don't think he will have to fret about those problems anymore. I doubt there is a snowball's chance in Hell he will ever be invited back.

      The Hoop-A-Thon was interesting... I went, watched Space Jam and ate food. lol  My dad just got my mom a replacement for her aging van - exact same car as mine, down to the year and the color. LOL Buuuut... she's got aluminum rims :) :) I'm stealing those... Oh, and her's might be a V6 rather than a V4, in that case we'd prolly just switch cars... teenagers like acceleration and she drives more than I do and would enjoy the fuel economy.  I'm currently obsessing with  Jimmy Eat World - the Authority Song  and    the Offspring - Amazed    Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown Cause everyone around's so hollow I'm alone Sometimes I think I'm going down But no one makes a sound They follow And I'm alone Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed Just to find tomorrow One more day and I'd be amazed Just to see it waiting And if I make it I'm still alone No more hope for better days But if I could change Then I'd really be amazed And when you know you can't relate To one more shiny face Your heart breaks No one cares And when you know you can't go on Cause everything is wrong Your heart breaks But no one's there

      Listening to:  The Authority Song    It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? The DJ never has it, J A M C Automatic. If those were Roy's headphones, you bet he'd play "What Goes On".  Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? Oh I'm here, that means something doesn't it? Oh won't you dance with me a little bit? Oh you don't notice, I guess the music's too loud. It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. Say anything you want already I'm not scared anymore. Honesty or mystery? Want something else? Just tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I?   Yesterday, Cam and Andrew left for Vegas. They're going to be gone until the 7th of next month. This sux, I'm gonna be so bored. Ah well I have a ton of h/w to keep me occupied. I'm going to my school tonight for the annual 'Hoop-a-Thon'.. Speaking of which, I'd better get off and take a shower.

      Today was weird... I got up at 6:50, decided to fool myself into thinking I had enough time to take a shower, which I took. then got ready from school, rushed out the door, got my sister to her school just barely on time, and amazingly got to school... no, wait, I was late. School was normal funny weird *blahness* until 1:00 when David Kelly, AT, Zooha, Lenny, Tyler and I all randomly left class early, spent 20 minutes trying to figure out which car(s) everyone was going in, and got on the road, heading toward a Engineering expo / banquet downtown. Holy crap, that ride was crazy... David Kelly drove his own car and everyone else piled into mine. We had decided ahead of time that we were going to be following Kelly, but judging by his driving, that was the last thing he wanted (LOL). Everyone in my car kept screaming and yelling and being generally distracting. The ambient noise levels in my car increased exponentially in parallel with the level of irrationality of David Kelly's driving techniques. In any event, we got there safely.   Apon arrival at the Double Tree Hotel (accross from the Lloyd Center), we discovered that the event was reschedualled to start at 2:45 instead of 2:00 (Darn it, we could have taken the MAX like we wanted to to begin with.) Anyway, after having fun in the glass elevators jacking multiple snack bags from the stash, Lenny and Tyler boarded one bus to go tour Freightliner, and the rest of us boarded the other to go to PSU.   Once we go there, the 60 or so of us all broke off into smaller groups. Zooha and I were fortunate enough to get into the group with like, 7 people. The first place we stopped at was the  STAR Siesmic Lab , the centerpiece of which is a 10' x 10'  Seismic Shake Table . Now this table has got to be one of the sweetest things I've seen in a very long time... it weighs 6? tons, can handle loads of well over 10 tons, and is powered by twin 60 gpm hydralic pumps which give it 3 Gs of acceleration over its travel range of 6 inches. It's amazing (and a little unsettling) looking down into the lab and watching a 13 thousand pound table suddely vibrate 6 inches either direction, more than 5 times a second. Saying you can feel the entire building shake would be an understatment.   The next lab we went to showcased an inverted pendulum, a computer operated device that balances a pendulum upside-down. It was pretty cool; the only method it has to balance it is using a motor to move a cart back and forth along a horizontal track, much like how an inkjet printer works, only a huge amount more precise. Its interesting, if you knock the pendulum off balance or spin it around, the cart spans back and forth, constantly adjusting until its back up, balanced again. Its so precise in fact, that it never stopped moving while we were in the room. The professor that was displaying it said that sometimes when he was in the room alone with the door closed, the pendulum would come to a point where it wasnt moving at all, but then the only thing he had to do was blowing softly at it from across the room to knock it ever so slightly off balance and start it back up again.  After that we toured the spatial design / rapid prototyping labs and finally went outside to check out the  mini baja car  that four graduates had built for their senior project and had entered into a national competition and won first place with. Finally, past 5:00 everyone got back into the bus and headed back to the Double Tree. Once we got back, we perused around the expo for a while. A lot of northwestern engineering colleges were there: OSU (go Beaves!), OIT, PSU, and many others. I talked to someone at length about an experiment involving micro-gravity that was going to taken up to be studied by way of NASA. (We saw this and head a bit about it back at PSU too). Oh, PSU currently has two other student experiments being tested on the international space station.  AT and David knew ahead of time who their hosts were, so they sat with them for the banquet, but the rest of us didnt know we needed to know beforehand, so we got adopted into another group (all but Zoo, who went with David). One of the engineers whom we were sitting with does accident reconstruction and a TON of other things. He makes about $250 an hour doing reconstruction work. o.O The other one was an engineer at Freightliner who told us some interesting storied about test-driving though Minnesota (I think) earlier this year to catch the -20 degree weather.   Dinner was good, but not as good as the to-die-for potatoes and steak at last weeks banquet (or at least thats what Lenny said). After dinner they introduced the head table and started into the presentations, most of which were about renewable energy etc. The last one was incredibly boring for the first half hour, but then the speaker played a sweet movie about an array of 80 staggeringly  huge  windmills (Im talking 300 tall towers, 240 diameter blade radius) off the coast of Norway (I think...).   Anyway, once that was over, it was getting close to 9:20 and we needed to leave, so by use of ASL, we all communicated to each other across the banquet hall that we were all thinking the same thing and made a hasty exit while they were answering question. (I feel bad, in our rush to get out quickly, Lenny, Tyler and I forgot to thank / say goodbye to our host.)   Holy crap, the drive home was CRAZY. First, it was raining like never before and the vast majority of the time I couldnt see any type of lane makings. Second, everyone was making massive amounts of noise, and third, my brakes werent working properly (Im getting them replaced tomorrow... *checks his watch* make that later today.) Once we hit Canyon road again, we started blasting techno and everyone in the backseat lost their sanity. I wish I had a video camera with me AT was making up his own beats and random odd sounds, Tyler was trying to rock the car with his erratic motions and Zoo started screaming and doing other things. ... Yeah that was prolly the best part of the trip. :)  Once I dropped everyone off at their cars at the high school (at 10:10) I came home (carefully, bad brakes remember?) and here I am now, typing this.

      I'm strangely happy. I've been all day today, but more so this afternoon and evening. I think I'm finally starting to come to terms with this whole situation... but then again, I might not be, this might all be me tricking myself ... again.

      Listening to:  Verve - Bittersweet Symphony ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers - Breaking the Girl ,  Jimmy Eat World - If You Don't, Don't  Talking to: Olivia  I have many topics to cover in this post, and I got something like 1 hours of sleep last night... on my floor, so forgive me if portions don't make much sense.  With that preclude, I'll start with a run-by-run of yesterday and today. After I finished school ( an hour after my last post) I took Melissa home and headed home myself, intent on swiftly cleaning my room and getting ready for that night. In reality, I got sidetracked, and didn't really start cleaning my room until almost two hours later. Close to 3:00 I started removing some stuff from my old car that I wanted to keep so that my dad could get rid of it later that day (it never actually happened, he's now debating doing something else with it). Anyway, that took a while and then I had to go back inside and mess with my annoying DHCP server to get the office computer (and then later Penguin, my Linux box) back on the net. My mom suddenly came in and informed me that I had under half-an-hour until the Beaverton Florist closed, so I got in the car and made my way over the get the corsage. On my way back I was going to stop at Blockbuster on Nimbus and rent the Hudsucker Proxy for the after-party, but at the intersection before it I realized that it would take me an extra 10 minutes minimum to get it, adding in traffic time, so I turned around and headed back home. Before I got in the shower I called Andrew and told him that I would be picking him up at 5:45 instead of 5:30 like originally planned (since it was like, 5:20 right then and I wasn't even home yet. I got home, jumped in the shower, grabbed the fastest car and flew over to his house... then we took like 20 minutes to get back out the door again. I got back to my house at 6:20 (Cam and Kelli got there at 6:10), ran around the house simultaneously changing into my suit, finding invitations and directions and eating a quick snack. Then we all got in the van and went to Adri's house where we picked her and Melissa up, but not without first stopping for pictures etc.   By this time it was about 7:00, and after some minor confusion about names of highways (it's highway 26 to I217 to the 405 to I5, no wait, it's I217 to highway 26 to, no wait...) we were on our way. Once we got downtown, we passed a parking structure and I was thinking about turning in, but then I decided that it would be safe to keep going and see if it was actually the Hilton the next block (I thought it was, but I wasn't sure). Then we got stuck in the valet parking line (which we should have used... it was $6, not upwards of $30 like we'd been told before. finally I got sick of waiting behind parked (literally) cars and cut into the bus lane momentarily. After that we circled around and ended up parking the place that I was going to park in to begin with, but didn't (lol). Oh, I can't go on without mention the weird on a streetcorner a few blocks from the Hilton, we were stopped at a stoplight and all just kinda watching him... he had stopped a couple in the middle of the sidewalk and kept getting in their way as they tried to pass. We couldn't hear what he was saying, but judging by his elaborate gestures and body movements, he was trying to ask them form something. Then as the light turned green and we drove through the interestection, he randomly ran over the the nearest wall and did a backflip off it. The couple took this opportunity to head off the other direction. (lol)  We got in and checked the time... 7:25 - amazing considering traffic and all the other delays. Exploring we went... looking for ways took kill the half-hour+ until the doors opened. We discovered the 23rd floor has a sweet viewing area, and a couple other people (Emily, Rachael T and others) discovered that there was some type of high class ball in the ballrooms (by crashing it... well, just taking the elevators down and walking through the middle of it, but they called it crashing it :) ). Turned out that we were in the first 10 or so people to arrive.   The doors finally opened at I-don't-know-when and we got out raffle tickets etc. and went in. It was really nice, all elegant and stuff, and a 12 (I think...) person jazz band played. We spent the next almost-2 hours sitting, taking pictures, eating and really really wanting to dance. Oh, in regards to dancing, our school's faculty (um, no, just our Principle ... the teacher wanted to dance too) won't allow it because we "have to be allowing of all denominations" or something... I wondering what group of people outside of the Amish still consider dancing something to be looked down on... It's sooo stupid. /tangent    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Once we were done sitting, we... stood. and stood some more. Actually we all went perusing the hotel some more and got our official pictures taken. Close to 11:15, my mom arrived from her concert at *I'll ask her where she was playing, later*.     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      After some confusing about who was taking which car, taking Josh, picking up Steven and getting the movie, my mom left in my car (which she had driven, so knew where it was parked) with Cam, Kelli and Andrew and I left (in her van again, blasting Country music) with Adri, Josh and Melissa. While they were getting the movie, we picked up Steven and we all convened at my house at 11:45. Andrew went downstairs and obsessed with Ninja Guiden and the rest of us started watching the Hudsucker Proxy. Cam and Kelli had to leave at 12-something and Josh left a bit afterward. Andrew came up eventually and finished watching the movie with us. Then, after waking Adri up (lol), Steven, Andrew and I took Adri and Melissa back to Adri's house (at 1:30). I'm not sure of exact times but I thing I fell asleep on my floor at 4:00, woke up again at just before 5, removed my contacts, and drifted in and out of sleep until 9 or 10.   After breakfast, I took Andrew home then went to an eye doctor appointment (with Steven still with me), came back home, made a tiny pizza, took Steven home, and here I am now, typing this.   ____________________________________________________   I approached the thought of the banquette with the idea that the best way to get through it happily was to ignore (i.e. to not think about; pay attention to, not shunning or something) Gwen and Richard, but that had already become impossible before we had even entered the building. Get this: Without my ever having seen his car before, out of all the 1000+ parking spaces in all the garages and all the streets around the Hilton, I managed to park  right beside  them. Heck, if the elevators weren't so small, we'd have prolly taken the same one down. And then I managed to pick one of the one tables directly behind then so any time I looked up at the band (or speakers etc.) I was looking right at them. I realized when I got home that they're also in the background of quite a few of my pictures. Grrr... I just can't get away from it. *feels like... *realizes that he can't 'feel'** Mixed emotions bring me sorrow, to put it lightly.   ____________________________________________________   School is troubling me... It's looking like I'm going to have to scrap my SOS Spanish class 'cause it's getting increasingly difficult to work with (stupid things like giving me a picture of a hideous woman and asking if i think she's beautiful (granted, in Spanish) I answer no and it grades me wrong... and how on earth are you supposed to tell someone's eye color when you can barely tell the color of their hair?? (Yeah I got both of those wrong too). I'm still wondering whether or not I'll be able to go to Vegas too... Even if Char says yes, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to skip an entire week of school.    ____________________________________________________   My family situation's still quite messed up too. Twice in one week has my dad absolutely blown up at my mom again, and once again have the police visited our house. Oh, and now it seems that he finally wants to leave his church because he's fed up with their continued harrassment of my mom (er... go figure...), but he's under the oppinion that he can arbitrarily decided on a new church home and that my mom will want to follow him to it. It's looking a bit more like he's going to give her new one a chance, but I'm not sure. LOL at this point our five person family is divided amoung four different church bodies.  I have a headache... I want wine. (LOL)

      Last week I spent the night at Cam's house... we mostly just sat around, built a huge fire, put it out (LOL), and watched 8 Mile (... still trying to find the plot... there's got to be one...).  Yesterday Bwitty stopped by - lol I didn't reconize her for a second. We talked for five minutes or so and I invited her to my after-party tonight (which I don't really think will be much of a party at all, but oh well.)  Speaking of tonight, tonight's finally WINTER BANQUETTE!! *yay* That should be interesting. I'm picking up Andrew at 5:30, Cam and Kelli are getting to my house at 6:00 and we're picking up Adri and Melissa at 6:15ish. The banquette starts at 8:00 and we'll prolly be ready to head out at 10:00, though actually it might be much later than that... I invited Steven to come over afterward if he wants... have no idea when 'afterward' will be though. The girls have to clear out at 12:30 (which also means Cam since he's going with Kelli) and *... thinks* Andrew, Josh and Steven might stay over night.  I'm getting out of school at 11:30 :) that's a plus right there too.

      Man, I'm having trouble finding time to sit down and get my linux box and affiliated webpage, email, etc. up and running. Heck, I'm having trouble finding time to do anything lately... I need to buckle down and get like, a week's worth of schoolwork done ahead of time too, before the 26th when I'm *hopefully* going to Vegas with Cam and Andrew for 10 days. ... That will be soooo fun if only it would work... My parents are fine with it, but Cam's sister Char (whose house we're going to be staying in, and whose kid Cam's going to be babysitting while we're there) is acting badly about it. I'm kinda confused cause she's fine with another person coming with Cam (Andrew already got the ticket like, two weeks ago), but she seems to be baulking at two people. Kinda annoying since I thought up the idea in the first place. (lol) Whatever...  Winter Banquette's this week... I wonder how that will go... I think I'm having a small party at my house afterward. (Well, I know I am having a party, the only thing about it that I don't know is how 'small' it'll be.

      I went and visited my mom's church,  Beaverton Christian Church  this morning. Last month they handed out 17  thousand  dollars in $10 bills, one to every person in the building. It was a parody of the parable of the talents, everyone was supposed to invest the ten dollars in whatever way they could think of and then turn in the proceeds in three weeks (last week). All the money gained on top of the $17,000 would go to help AIDs victims in Africa. People were very creative, ideas carried out ranged from selling flowers on freeway onramps to opening a sushi bar at school to making collector's mailboxes out of model trains. As of the final count yesterday, they had received $39,395 back, and there's much more coming in. I'm thinking that I might start attending BCC on a regular basis; I'll pray about it and see where God leads...  Oh, btw, this church is by no means small... they can fit more people on their  stage  than Calvary has ever had in their entire auditorium... (LOL)

It was ... yeah it just "was" LOL close to the end of the hour and a half, he asked us several questions along the lines on "Show of hands, who here wants to have great sex eventually" or, "Who wants to have sex lots?" LOL it was sooooo funny watching people kinda start to put their hand up then stop, then hold it up again... Don't worry, the entire thing was from a biblical standpoint (um, duh, it's a Christian school...) and it was all geared toward waiting to get married and stuff. ...But it was pretty funny :)

      Well today was good I think... I'm not a very accurate judge anymore. School got out at 1:30 so all the student body and faculty were free to attend a Funeral for Brandon's (a senior) mom. It was really neat, his dad's one of the worship leaders at Harvest (their church), and led worship for the service.  Brandon got up and spoke for a bit; it's amazing how well he's taking it all. He's much stronger than, well, almost anyone I know'd be in his situation.  Afterward, several seniors and I went out to Red Robin for linner ... or dunch... (Why isn't there a word for lunch/dinner, but there's brunch?) They're such a great group of people... wish I could spend more time with them.

This consists of starting in the front entrance, taking a bus to the back entrance to get the registration badges, and walking through the entire Las Vegas Convention Center to go back to the front entrance and pick up the special badge holder that no-one seemed to know about. 5) Makes it a pleasure to walk away from snake-oil vendors. 4) Sets a new fashion trend. 3) Makes high heel-wearing women jealous. 2) Reduces "skin effect" on bottoms of feet. 1) Youre ready for bed when you walk back to your hotel.

      This was given to me by someone who wants to keep his anonymity:   A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse-racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races. However, at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day, the local paper carried this headline: PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS  The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read: PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT  The bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headlines read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS  This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.  The bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for ten dollars. The next day the paper read: NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00  This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild. The next day the headlines read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE.  The bishop was buried the next day.

      "Janet Jackson exposing her breast during the Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday night has proved to be the most-searched event in the history of the Internet." Now doesn't that kinda give you a feel of what this world's shaping up to be? Oh, and all you Tivo owners out there, beware! Tivo has legal access to your machine to retrieve and view the logs of EVERY SINGLE button ever pushed and EVERY SINGLE moment ever viewed via it... With this technology, they've determined that the breast incident was also the most Tivo replayed moment in history.

      Listening to:  Joe Satriani - Summer Song  Thinking: How times have changed...  I remember probably the happiest period of time in my life - the start of my 6th grade year and my all the new things it brought. I was so happy my first day of youth group (well, actually I as several other would be 6th graders had been attending for some time, but this was the first day we met at the then-new building, TVJA, and the first time I was technically part of the group. As time went on, I started developing my little nitch there - my friends (of whom Goody was my best), my role (sound guy)... and everything just fit together so happily. Life was pretty much care free back then, sure I had all the issues at home, in some ways better in many ways worse than now, but I didn't pay attention to them, they were just an annoyance that was gradually, without my seeing it, wearing me down.   Now though, everything's different, the only place I feel like I truly belong anymore is school, and not even so much there anymore... now that I'm like a 1.2 GPA student with a learning disability that seems to get me into trouble a lot. My core group of friends has changed to Cameran, Andrew, Steven, d'Dee (lol), Kristy, and assorted others. I've been through a short lived romantic relationship that has its definite plusses and minuses... I go to school again. (LOL, um yeah, I was home schooled for most of my life) I have a car, the lingering need to get a job, all the cares and worries of a teenager (plus some that hopefully the vast majority of us don't have to face), and I'm just generally having trouble coping with life. I have a rather irrational emotional complex that can change on a dime, but never allow me to show it.   I think really the first thing that needs changing to get my out of this rut of depression that I keep falling back into again is a spirit of thankfulness and trust that God is good and looking out for me even when I can't see it. This is tough however, when at times I'm finding myself doubting the very basis of faith that my hope rests on... Does God really exist? Is this all just something we make up to help us get through life, or is it real? These are questions that I struggle with fairly frequently and I really (no matter what it appears on the outside) don't think I've ever answered myself.  Pray for me will yah' guys? I need it, I really have no idea where my life's going right now and it scares me.

      I just ran across an interesting blog called  Hot Abercrombie Chick!  ... um... yeah, despite the name, it belongs to a college freshman (girl), a "probable" philosophy major. In her Feb. 3rd post she has an overview of the whole pro life / choice issue from what seems to be an unbiased standpoint. I haven't read much of her stuff (indeed, not even all of the abortion write up), but what I've seen I like. Most of the people that comment on her site are far left liberals, but I like some of what she herself has to say. Go check it out and tell me what you think.

       The Farewell Dossier  (the world's largest non-nuclear explosion ever to be seen from space was caused by a software trojan)  I copied the article incase anyone reading this doesn't have a  New York Times  subscription   By WILLIAM SAFIRE Published: February 2, 2004  Wahington Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of "the Farewell dossier": how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia  all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss  helped us win the cold war.  Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president  dtente notwithstanding  to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the U.S.S.R.  Seven years later, we learned how the K.G.B. responded. I was writing a series of hard-line columns denouncing the financial backing being given Moscow by Germany and Britain for a major natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy supplies to the Communists, as well as generate $8 billion a year to support Soviet computer and satellite research.  President Franois Mitterrand of France also opposed the gas pipeline. He took President Reagan aside at a conference in Ottawa on July 19, 1981, to reveal that France had recruited a key K.G.B. officer in Moscow Center.   Col. Vladimir Vetrov provided what French intelligence called the Farewell dossier. It contained documents from the K.G.B. Technology Directorate showing how the Soviets were systematically stealing  or secretly buying through third parties  the radar, machine tools and semiconductors to keep the Russians nearly competitive with U.S. military-industrial strength through the 70's. In effect, the U.S. was in an arms race with itself.  Reagan passed this on to William J. Casey, his director of central intelligence, now remembered only for the Iran-contra fiasco. Casey called in Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration in the U.S. and Japan, Weiss counseled against deportation.   Instead, according to Reed  a former Air Force secretary whose fascinating cold war book, "At the Abyss," will be published by Random House next month  Weiss said: "Why not help the Soviets with their shopping? Now that we know what they want, we can help them get it." The catch: computer chips would be designed to pass Soviet quality tests and then to fail in operation.   In our complex disinformation scheme, deliberately flawed designs for stealth technology and space defense sent Russian scientists down paths that wasted time and money.   The technology topping the Soviets' wish list was for computer control systems to automate the operation of the new trans-Siberian gas pipeline. When we turned down their overt purchase order, the K.G.B. sent a covert agent into a Canadian company to steal the software; tipped off by Farewell, we added what geeks call a "Trojan Horse" to the pirated product.   "The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire," writes Reed, "to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space."   Our Norad monitors feared a nuclear detonation, but satellites that would have picked up its electromagnetic pulse were silent. That mystified many in the White House, but "Gus Weiss came down the hall to tell his fellow NSC staffers not to worry. It took him another twenty years to tell me why."   Farewell stayed secret because the blast in June 1982, estimated at three kilotons, took place in the Siberian wilderness, with no casualties known. Nor was the red-faced K.G.B. about to complain publicly about being tricked by bogus technology. But all the software it had stolen for years was suddenly suspect, which stopped or delayed the work of thousands of worried Russian technicians and scientists.   Vetrov was caught and executed in 1983. A year later, Bill Casey ordered the K.G.B. collection network rolled up, closing the Farewell dossier. Gus Weiss died from a fall a few months ago. Now is a time to remember that sometimes our spooks get it right in a big way.

      In computers and the Internet, a geek is a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with technology to the point of sometimes not appearing to be normal. As computer technology becomes less frightening to larger numbers of people, society seems to be developing a more tolerant, even benevolent view of the geek. In some circles, it is considered a compliment to be called a geek because the term implies a high level of capability with technology. The term  hacker  used to connote competence more strongly than the term geek, but since media almost always uses the term hacker to mean someone who attempts to break into computer systems (see  cracker ), geek has become a more desirable label. Historically, a geek was a circus person in the sideshow who performed some bizarre feat.   this article was found  here

That sense is said to have disappeared from the literary language in the 17th century, but it has survived in popular usage and is widely found nowadays in literate speech and writing.

      Music mood:  the Ataris - In This Diary   When I woke up this morning I was so full of emotion... I wanted to write pages to this blog, but now all that's left of my thoughts are a few scattered memories.   School seems so bittersweet now... It's like I don't care at all about grades anymore, prolly because I feel helpless and incompetent. I'll never be good enough, I'll never be good enough. - Thats what I keep telling myself about both my schoolwork and pathetic, lovesick musings. Truth is though, with the new ADD / Dyslexia program that I'm on and support from my parents and most of my teachers, I probably can overcome the schoolwork issues and pull my GPA up from something like 1.1 now to at least a 3.0. Even after that though, the other problem still remains and in truth, for that I really don't think I'll ever be good enough.  Why oh why does this world have to be so cruel? Why do I have to keep torturing myself with all these emotional politics?  Holy crap, I need Cameran there at the banquette with me so I'll have a little support to fall back on... Hope he can come.

      btw, an update on my living conditions at home... I have successfully retrieved the charger for my cell, but I'm keeping it off most of the time so my parents aren't suspisious. I've also completely circumvented the lock on the office door, and have gotten the serial numbers of the keys for both locks so I'll be able to make copies whenever I need to. I've left myself a route of access into my supposedly locked room though I may or may not need to use it as I've convinced my parentals to allow my computer outside of the room, though it remains un-networked, and as such, not connected to the web. I have a plan for circumventing that too, two plans actually, both of which are already starting to go into affect. All I really need right now is a bit of luck and a half hour with the house to myself. I also still have keys to every car except my mom's new one even though my mom thinks I don't have any of them.

      Well, today was interesting... NOT! Nothing happened at all... 'cept for my mom getting mad at my sister for taking a walk with her friend Nicky. They couldn't find her to ask her, so they told me to tell mom where they were if I saw her, which I did when she asked several minutes after they left. When I told her she went to the front door and started yelling my sister's name out it really loudly. Annoyed, she came back inside (they were out of earshot) and when they got home no more than ten mintues later, she pulled my sister downstairs to talk to her,  and when they got done talking, my mom left to a recital (or something) and dragged Nicky along with her to it. I have no idea what that was about... not sure how she has the right to punish SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD... But hey, I wouldn't be one to understand my mom. (LOL)   Mi madre es loco.

      Yesterday, the long version...   I snuck out of the house around noon and Adri and Steven came and picked me up. We stopped for gas and Adri's mom called (file that information away for later) and then were on our way again. We got to Becky's house a bit afterward (prolly something like 1:00), stayed there for a while, then got a ride to the closest MAX station. We rode that to the zoo, but there Adri's mom called and got mad at her for not calling and telling her when we were leaving Becky's house. Because of this, Adri's mom came and picked her up (go  here  to read Adri's oppinion about that - lol). My mom had gotten home before this, discovered I was gone, and had begun a day-long endevor to call as many people as possible and trash-talk me as much as possible in hopes that it would bring me home faster (F*** you, mom...) Anyway, she had gotten around to Adri's mom, and Adri's mom had kindly offered me a ride home, but I refused it saying that I hadn't come this far just to go back home when my mom told me to (...again).   Anyway, long story short, Becky, Steven and I had a great time at the zoo, though it was close to closing time and I don't think we saw  every single  exibit, but yeah, we had a great time. Afterward, we went further downtown (without paying MAX fare since we were only three stops from Fareless Square - o.O) and ate linner / dunch at Pioneer Place.  We finally headed back to Hillsboro on the MAx and arrived at the end of the line around 7:00. Becky's dad came to pick us up, but informed me that my mom had called and instructed him not to, under any circumstances, give me a ride anywere... That was odd, but whatever. Yeah... anyway, Steven and I just ran the -1 miles to another MAX stop, got on, went to the Fair Grounds, got off, ran another 1000+ feet and met up with them at the Burgerville (lol... I'm still not sure why we went there... oh well, whatever). Anyway, we said goodbye to them and decided to head back. On the way back to Beaverton Transit on the MAX, two random college girls came up to us and started majorly hitting on us... The conversation went something like this:  Them: So, what'cha doing later tonight? Us: Um... going home... Them: Aw come on, it's Saturday night, night before break, let's go have some fun! Us: Um... all last week has been break. Them: Yeah, wait, wha...? how old are you? Us: 17... Them: Serious, no way! (to eachother: ooo, ooo, jail babe!) *We kinda just look at eachother right about now, wonder when they're going to go away* Them: (to eachother again: Well, they're kinda cute anyhow)  This kept going on for a bit, but you get the gist of it...  When we finally got to Beaverton Transit, we boarded a bus heading for my house, had an interesting discussion about the controversial restraunt  Hoooters  with a complete stranger, and finally arrived at the bus stop just over a mile from my house. Steven called him mom, who came and picked him up once we got to my door, and I went inside and greeted... my sisters. Turns out that my mom was gone to a bridal shower and my dad was gone to... something or other else.  Anyway, once my mom and dad both got home, they sat me down and mom listed her punishments for me (My dad had no punishments because in his view, I really didn't do much wrong... just needed some time to get away for a while.)  Punishments are as follows: 1. The doors to my bedroom and the office have locks installed on them, I am not allowed access to them for two weeks, which, in theory, negates the possibility of internet usage. 2. I am not allowed to drive for two weeks, though mom did return my car itself. 3. No activities whatsoever outside of school (this includes extra Calculus help after school...)

      Well, I'm royaly screwed... Long story short, I snuck out of the house today with Steven and Adri and went to Becky's house then the zoo.   My parents changed the locks on my room and the office so I can't use a computer or do anything else normal. They're gone right now and I have no idea what else they have in store for me...  I'll prolly not be posting for a while outside of school, so, as KT says, tootles.  Oh, btw Mandy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I wasn't even thinking about prom and all that when all this happened... This was all just too spur-of-the-moment. I probably killed our plans about going, and again, I'm really sorry.

      Crap, my mom is being a huge b*tch. Tomorrow I'm spending the day on the town, going to the zoo among other things with Becky, Mandy, Adri and Steven. This is all well and good except for a counseling appointment that my mom had made a while back (without telling me) for 4:00 tomorrow. When she brought it to my attention, I immediately knew that it was going to need to cancel it since it simply would not fit into the schedule for tomorrow, but when I asked her to do it (since she made the appointment herself) she wouldn't hear of it. So, I did the responsible thing and called my counselor and canceled the appointment myself. We were both fine with it but... about half an hour ago, mom asked me if I'd skewed my schedule to make room for the appointment yet, and I was about to lie to her just to get out of having to explain it all over to her, but I didn't and told her that I'd canceled it myself. She was furious and decided to punish me by giving me FOUR F***ING HOURS OF HOMEWORK to do before I go tomorrow morning... AFTER SHE SAID THAT NO MATTER WHAT, I WOULD GET ALL DAY OFF TOMORROW!  Oh my gosh, she's sooo....  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!.....  *restrains himself from blowing up or shooting something*  But wait, there's more... She originally wanted me to meet her at Costco tomorrow morning at 10 to pick up my glasses then go with her to the library to get some books for my English term paper (why she has to be there for me to do that, I don't know...), but then we decided that I would just park my car at the grocery store across from Steven's house so we wouldn't have to take both vehicles all over... I'm realizing that that's a very bad thing now because she's now going to try to check my work to make sure it's done, and won't let me go if it's not...  As I said to Steven moments ago: "well, one way I get literally no sleep, another way we start out at like, 3pm instead of 11am (and Adri has to be back home by 5), and another way, the day goes fine, 'cept for my parents harassing me by calling me constantly, and I wouldn't but it past them to come to the zoo since they already know I'm going to be there... then life'll be hell for a while at home... LOL Screw my mom and her stupid control issues."

      If you don't already have this song, get it. I love it, it's beautiful.    Incubus - I Miss You    To see you when I wake up, is a gift I didn't think could be real. To know that you feel the same, as I do, is a Three-fold utopian dream. You do something to me  That I can't explain.  So would I be out of line, if I said  I miss you? I see your picture; I smell your skin on, the empty pillow next to mine. You have only been gone ten days, but already I am wasting away. I know I'll see you again  Whether far or soon. But I need you to know, that I care  And I miss you.

      Ok, about last week... *goes back and finally edits the Sunday March 14, 9:06:05 AM post*  Concerning the last three days:  *after typing this, he got a call that the salmon that his dad's been BBQing was ready, so he ran upstairs, ate it, and came back down to finish this*  Friday was like any other day really except that we were on EOD (End Of Day) schedule for a talent show.  The talent show lineup (as best can be remembered by Armaan): 1. Josh R playing piano 2. Alex sticking his hand in his mouth, putting both legs behind his head, making himself sneeze with a Q-tip  up his nose  and licking his elbow (holy crap) 3. Carissa (spl?) playing piano 4. Megan, Patrick and Brandon playing / singing *doesn't remember* 5. Jen, Gwen and Adri singing  Into the West by Annie Lennox  (all looking cute and sounding wonderful, I might add) 6. Derek and Joel tearing up the stage with a sweet sweet sweet bass / drum duet (they are so friggin' good) 8. Megan and Ali singing  Goodbye to You by Michelle Branch  9. Andrew and David singing an ode to the word "sick"  After this, I said goodbye to everyone for spring break and went back home to collect my computer etc. to set up at Jon-Mark's house for the big all-night LAN party. Now that party was fun... total geeks hanging around each other, having a good time. In attendance were Jon-Mark, Deren (duh and duh), Ryan, Ryan, Brian, Zoo, *someone else that had to leave early, and consequently, I didn't catch his name* and myself. StarCraft all around... I brought food... Wired, Henry Winehard's Cream Soda, chips, and  3 pounds  of Reese's Pieces (lol) Man, we need to have another of those really soon, I wanna hang around those guys more often... so funny :) LOL, One of the Ryans can bend so far backward that he can remove his glasses with his feet! It's great.   I took some video with my camera... will put it up on the web as soon as I pull it off... I'll prolly pull some pics off it too... Speaking of pics, I have a background changer that changes my background picture every so often, and it happened to be on this really cute picture of Gwen and Danie from the banquette. One of the guys saw it and was like "Oh my gosh, they're hot" so I turned off the background changer and it's still my desktop right now (LOL)  Zoo is soo crazy at Starcraft... he creamed every single one of us even when the remaining four (after several had been annihilated) allied and worked against him.  LOLOL We actually had so much load on the lines that we killed the power to most of the lower floor of his house around 10am Sat... We never did figure out what the problem was though we're thinking it might be a GFI somewhere that we couldn't find. Hope they get that fixed.  Anyway, I finally left at 12:40 on Saturday and Steven & Becky called me as soon as I got in the car... Looking back on that I'm quite glad they did... kept me from falling asleep on the way home. LOL, I wonder how that conversation went... I was so tired I don't remember any of it, and I doubt I made much sense to them either. :)  Later that night, after I got 3 or so hours of sleep, I picked up Steven, drove Beaverton Transit Station and we took the MAX out to Portland where the Columbia Symphony was having a concert. There were only two pieces, a symphony and a masse, but they were each about an hour long. I don't get how my mom can play for two hours straight... Id' get so tired (lol). The masse was cool. Aside from the orchestra, it involved a 200 person (it looked like that many, maybe I'm remembering wrong...) choir, four soloists, and the pipe organ in the sanctuary that it was performed in (which is actually two pipe organs, one on the back wall, and one on the front).  Afterward, we all went to a really nice bar for a while that a lot of the orchestra members go to afterwards and finally succeeded in getting a hold of Becky (wed been trying to call her but the line was busy, then we got on aim from my phone but she wasnt on, so we just waited and called a couple more times). We left and went back to my car because the restaurant section of the bar was too expensive (go figure). After driving around for another hour trying to find some place that was open (it was past 11), Steven and I went to a local Sherris and had dinner.   After I took him back home and got back home myself, I tried to get to bed and get to sleep but I was too restless to do so I finally got to sleep after 7am (LOL) and woke up today at 5:30pm (wow, my body clock is going to be messed up because of all this) and Im meeting my uncle to do something tomorrow at 10am so I need to get to bed at a decent time tonight erk

      I'm sure everything's heading downhill from here, but at the moment I feel quite good. Maybe it's cause I'm all warm and comfy in a bathrode - Wikiki day at school so I'm wearing swim trunks, a hawaii shirt, sandals and a towel. Understandably, I'm bringing a change of clothes though since it's predicted that it'll be cloudy and cold all day. Whatever...  My hand's starting to heal up... I drove myself yesterday. Speaking of driving, it's funny how many people from school I meet on the road on the way to school... at the intersection of 229th and TV highway yesterday, Gwen and her dad were the first stopped (in his spiffy new X5), then Rachael Z. and her mom, then me, then Brent freezing his butt off cause his mom had said that it would be a nice day... He took that to mean that the morning would be nice too so he lowered the top on his Wrangler (lol).

      I have a  massive  headache and my hand and srm still hurt... life sux, though today's comfortable day at school so i'm wearing a soft jogging suit and bathrobe. That sorta helps cheer life up. O, and I drove my car home from Melissa's house yesterday after helping her and Danie with a movie for spanish. ...That was a mistake. Er, no, not helping them, driving... My hand was all messed up again afterward, so today I got a ride with Adri. May be a couple days yet before I can drive again.

      Hey I did finally end up going to Melissa and YoungHee's party, but while there I had an encounter with a rose bush that left my right arm / hand useless for the time being. Because of this I'm not going to write the long and envolved post about it that I was going to, but'll save it for later.   Wow, I type so much slower with just my left hand (LOL)  *added Sunday March 21st*  Yeah about that party... I did more schoolwork in the 24 hours before it that I'd ever thought possible because my mom wouldn't let me go unless a certain amount of back work was done. ...That was crazy... well, so was how much I drove in the hour before the party: It started at three and I left the house at 1:55... 'Drove to the Beaverton/Tigard border, bought gifts, drove to Steven's house a bit deeper into Beaverton, drove all the way around inot greater Beaverton (Farmington area and such) to avoid a huge traffic jam that I'd seen before... drove  all  the way into Hillsboro to pick up Cam, stayed a bit the wrap presents and watch part of a movie (?!? lol) then brove back to Aloha to arive at Melissa's house at just after 3:10.  Certain parties whose names I will not mention made the whole thing more of a pain than it already was by continously cracking sick jokes and egging eachother on... That was really annoying. Cam, Melissa, Jen and I finally went outside to get away from it, and finally locked ourselves (minus Jen, I think) in my car. That sorta backfired because the people we were trying to get away from followed us outside but we decided to to protest because now they weren't inside and everyone could go back to watching to movie or whatever it was they were trying to do...  Finally after a while, we succeded in getting just Cam, Melissa, *will insert name of Melissa's friend when I ask Melissa what it is later...* and I in the car by ourselves and drove off for a while.  A bit after that, I turned my car around so the back was facing the basketball hoop and started playing music... That was fun, we just hung out outside doing whatever for a while.  Then, after the sickness had finally died down, I went back inside to watch everyone play Dance Dance Revolution on someone's Playstation2. That was pretty funny.  After all this came my expirience with the rosebush... that was when almost everyone was leaving so I didn't miss out on much because of it (lol) You know, looking back on it from over a week later, I'm realizing that that was the only reason Gwen talked to me that night so I guess I should be thankful for it in some weird was... (LOL)  Speaking of Gwen, let's talk about social networking at the party and such: First and formost, YoungHee's bro. apparently goes to TVJA and from that YoungHee knows Jeff, whom she brought over to do some magic tricks... Now, Cam, Andrew (who wasn't there, but has been at almost every other activity) and I had always been somehow led to believe that Jeff was someone to shy away from and because of such, never relaly talked to him. But now, in the closer envirionment of the party, he seemed like someone interesting to get to know. The second person whom I know almost nothing about is Richard: When we came, Jen, Gwen and Adri were hunkered away in Melissa's room practicing a song that they sang on Friday, so I got a chance to talk to Richard a bit, not long mind you though because the girls got out of the room almost immediately after we got there... From then on, Richard and Gwen were pretty seclusive, mostly cuddling and spending time in rooms apart from where everyone else was... I think that's in part the fault of the two people that were annoying everyone else that I talked about earlier. Oh well, I don't know what to make of it. Sux for me (LOL) but that's life.

      Current mood: sad / depressed / whatever  It doesn't look like I'm going to be able to go to Melissa and YoungHee's party on Sat, and, in consequnece, not going be able to provide rides for Steven and Cam to it. GRRRRRR..... I've got such a mountain of continually backed up schoolwork that keeps gettign added to every day. I can't cope with this... I feel like just taking a break from sanity for a while. Anyone wanna come with me? (lol)  In other news, it's about 2,614 steps from Josh M's front door to my front door. I know this because I was bored, so I ran to his house and back earlier tonight. Took a bit, but was refreshing.  HBOK my life pisses me off... actually, my life depresses me, what pisses me off is my lack of ability to do anything about my life slowly deteriorating before my eyes.

      Well, I'm at school now, so I guess this is 'further notice' (lol). My parents and I met with the very understanding school board last night, who gave me a 20 demerit extention.  In other news, I've collected such a huge amount of detention / suspensioin slips this year that I'm building one or even two REG devices (you all remember what those are, right?) out of them. My Chem. teacher laughed when I told him.

      Listening to:  Kenny G. - Titanic (Instrumental)   Well, I had a good day today... I've been suspended until further notice (which will hopefully be deliberated tonight) for having 100 demerits. My school uses a system of demerits where you get five for a minor offence (every time you get a detention you get a minimum of five demerits). I accumulated a massive amount of detentions to the first semester simply for being tardy because it takes so long to drop off my sister before school. Tardies reset every quarter, and when they do you get two free ones and 4 possibilities to be excused by parents. Every tardy after that is a detention of increasing length and finally at the sixth tardy you get ISS (In-School-Suspension). At the third one you're automatically up for expulsion from the school. Btw, there are two different running tallies of tardies, one for first period and one for all the rest of the periods, so it's different being late for school than being late in between classes.  First semester we (the faculty and I) realized there was a problem when I'd accumulated 16 first-period tardies... that's on top of the ... 10 or so that had been excused. LOL  In any event, I came into this quarter with a ton of demerits and only made that worse by being tardy many times again and by forgetting to serve detentions (an extra detention and 20 demerits). So, yeah... In any event, The school board's holding a special meeting tonight to discuss what to do about me since by our school's bylaws the principle has to recommend to the board, dismissal of anyone that gets 100 demerits. I'm not sure what's going to happen but I do know that the only one who seems outright against me is the principle... everyone one else has an attitude of 'how can the school help you?'  Whatever... that's what's going on in my life right now.  Oh, I maintain that today was good :) pretty carefree, everyone was gone so I had the entire day to be lazy, sleep in and do some work around the house. ... The first non-stressful day in a good while.

      For the first time in a quite a while, I went to youthgroup tonight. 'Brought Adri with me too. Man, I was so down the whole night... A couple times I was almost crying. I don't know really what it was... No, I take that back, I know exactly what it was... Standing there singing, sitting there listening to the message, I couldn't quite keep my attention on what was happening around me. Mind wandering, thoughts drifting, faded memories coming back again to haunt my mind: I'm starting to think I really don't have a place anymore... Everything at church seems so vague, so foreign now, everything at school seems like wishful memories or weeping past, everything at home seems well, horrible. Everywhere I turn I'm reminded of something I'm trying to let go of, was trying to let go of. Then I begin to retrace my steps and realize that I shouldn't be trying to let go of it at all... Or should I? It's been almost eight months now and I still can't figure it out.  What's best for her?  What's best for me?  ...  God, why can't I just tell her how much I'm in love with her?  *cries himself to sleep*

      I'm pissed at my parents... On Monday my mom had told me to get to bed at 10:30, which I did. I couldn't sleep because I'm not used to trying to that early, and close to 11:45 I got up to get a drink. She arrived home, accused me of disobeying her (what the he... such a huge offence...) and then accused me of lying to her when I tried to convince her otherwise. Whatever... I just went back to bed and forgot about it, but then the next night she was out again, and sometime around 9:50 my dad was like, "Why aren't you in bed?" I just kinda  stared blankly at him and was like "wha...?!?" I learned that apparently as a punishment for not being in bed 'on time' on Monday I was supposed to go to be at the hideous time of 9:30 on Tuesday. My mom thought that my dad had told me and my dad had thought that my mom had. It gets even better though... My stupid stupid mom didn't care that it was infact my dad's fault, she decided to punish me for the 'offence'  again  on Wednesday by making me go to bed again at 9:30.  Now on Wed. I don't normally even get home untill past 6:30 and yesterday, my dad had to run a couple errands so I didn't get home untill past 7. I flat out told her that I wouldn't have enough time no matter how she sliced it and that I was not going to go to bed at 9:30. Oh, by the way, we're having a blood drive today at school and I signed up for it assuming my parents would be perfectly fine with it. I mentioned it to my dad, who didn't care, and again to my mom when I got home, right before I told her that I wasn't going to be able to get to bed on time. She mentioned that she had some concern about me being constantly fatigued and that it might make it worse if I were to give blood, but then had to run out the door to catch a movie with some friends.  I called her sometime after 9:30 to address the concerns that she had because I was getting ready for bed, but she steered the conversation to why I wasn't already in bed, not some health issues she might have with me donating blood. I was really hurt by that because it says to me that she cares more about her rules that she impetuously lays down than for me, her son's health. We ended up in an argument which consisted of me almost pleading with her to hear me out, but finally after she cut me off the umpteenth time and said no, I hung up on her. I know, I know, that was a bad thing to do and I already appologized to her. Regaining my composure in a matter of seconds, I kept from crying and went upstairs to my dad's room and right as I knocked on his door, my mom called him. She started telling him her side of the story and before I could get a word in edge-wise, he started doing to her what she had just before been doing to me: abruptly steering the conversation to another topic and blaming it all on her. He started on his whole partyline about how she was a horrible wife and mother and she should be home helping us kids with homework and such (btw, she pours countless hours into doing stuff like that, he just never takes the time to think through his name-calling, yelling tantrums) Anyway, he ended up hanging up on her too, but for a much different reason than I did.   Now would be a good time to clarify that my family's disfunctional.   Anyway, this morning I talked to my mom for a good twenty minutes about the blood donation thing, and she still is stubbornly sticking to punishing me for something that I didn't do and then wasn't informed that I 'did' by not letting me help save a life. Brilliant mom, just brilliant.

         Pictures will take a long time to load, please be patient     Today was awesome! I'll append this post with a fairly long approximation of the day, but it'll take a bit to write, so sit tight.  In the mean time, pictures have been uploaded to  http://members.lycos.co.uk/ccbyg    Painting etc...   On the way over to the Cornelius Community Baptist, I called Cam who had just woken up and invited him to come with me, but he unfortunately he couldn't. Once I got there, I checked the first room (which will become the worship room, but I didn't know that yet), then had a bit of trouble getting into the second room - one of the doors was locked and the other was blocked closed ... I called Mary who didn't answer then it dawned on me to knock. (lol) I did, the door opened and in the room painting were Mary, Jamie, Danie, Jon, Lenny and Alex.  Right after I got there, we switched back to the other room because we'd ran out of red paint for the moment and Over the next hour or so I learned why we were getting the rooms ready to be used - Mary and Lenny have basically taken it upon themselves to start a youth group. I'm pretty excited about it, we've already gotten a lot of it planned out and we're working on the rest - pretty good for an idea that was though up last week. (lol)  At some point Lenny, Jamie and I went out to get some more red paint and met Melissa coming in as we were leaving to go to Ace Hardware. She had her camera with us and all the pictures I'm going to post were taken by it. Speaking of pictures, a while after we got back, Lenny went out and got pizza, and we took a break to eat and take these pictures: (hover your mouse over all the pictures in the post for title)                             btw, the piece of wood that Lenny's hanging off of in "the Lenny Scale" is a broken tire swing. - This happens to currently be my background.    We went back inside and continued painting. Lenny could have almost been on a first-name basis with the employees of Ace for the number of times he had to go back there, but we finally got the rooms looking perhaps not we had planned, but good anyways. Here are some pics of us painting the to-be Game Room:                                        We were originally going to paint these three sides of this room red and one side light green (color of the other room) and then use the green to make the red a plaid, but we eventually decided to go with that blue for one wall and continue using red for the other three. The last paint trip Lenny took, Ace got the shade of red a bit off, so after we touched up the wall, we realized that we could clearly see the difference between the old red and the new. We decided to use handprints to draw attention away from the errors on the wall and it worked out quite nicely. The last picture here is the Worship Room and some stuff that's been donated to our fledgling youth group.               After we were finally done for the day, we sorta lounged around while Abby and Jamie washed all the stuff off. Our excuse was that there was only one sink, but in reality, we did do almost as much work as them, cleaning up upstairs, we were just done faster. (lol)               For some reason Abby and Jamie started running around outside, pretending to fight and Lenny ran after snapping pictures. It went on for like ten minutes - was pretty funny.               Once we had locked up, we went back around the front, signed each others already-painted shirts and took a group picture.             We left and went to Izzy's where Mary's dad was treating us to dinner... On the way there Becky called me and I invited her to come to the youth group when we start it. At one point I noticed Lenny's car ahead of me and to the left, signaling and people waving at me from inside. Eventually I figured out that they wanted me to fall into the lane behind then, and puzzled, I did so knowing full well that both out lanes were turning ahead and that the one I was in would have been faster. I was on the phone though and didn't feel like making a mistake and having to turn around if for some reason I was remembering the road wrong. (lol)  Once we got to Izzy's we were pretty loud and obnoxious. (I think anyway - lol) Oh, and we were REALLY slap-happy - made for a strange time.                                   Yeah, that was a really fun day...

      You know, there are words in geekdom, like in any other area that are taken from their original meaning and changed slightly to better facilitate release into the populous.  Words in question: Gigabyte and Hacker  LOL, I have no idea why I'm posting about this, but here goes...  First, gigabyte... having a little background on the root of the word helps to understand the problem: Computers are at the very basic, a huge, huge compilation of switches that can either be on or off, we call this base 2 (because there are only two positions that they can be in) or binary. In binary a 1 is on and a 0 is off. That's how a computer stores information, in a sequence of 1s and 0s. One space that can be occupied by either a 1 or a 0 is called a bit. A sequence of eight of these is called a byte. For reasons I won't go into here, eight just happens to be the 'magic number' of 1s and 0s that we use to communicate a standard sequence of information (like a number or letter... capital A is 01000001 in binary, lowercase a is 01100001).   The problem lies in societies' grasp of numbers, just as ancient societies used base 6 in mathematics (that's where 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour and other things like 360 degrees in a circle came from - all multiples of 6), so does our society use a base 10 system - all our mathematics are rooted in multiples of 10. Not so with binary, which we've already established, is base 2. Everything involving information storage in computers is figured in multiples of 2 - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc. As computers advance, more and more storage space is needed bigger and bigger numbers are need to describe that larger space... First bit, then byte, which is eight bits, the a Kilobyte, which is 1024 bytes, then a Megabyte, which is 1024 Kilobytes, then Gigabyte, which is 1024 Megabytes. Now, let's stop and think about this for a minute... A Gigabyte is 8 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bits... that's 8,589,934,592 ones and zeros... pretty impressive huh?  Now again, back to the problem... societies' changing of a word from its orrignal meaning to something that's better understood by the populous. Our culture is based upon everything conforming to us, us sitting back and just letting it all fall into place. Case in point: tech people are starting to realize that the average non-tech person (who I call the layman)  for some reason can't figure out that a standard like Gigabyte  can  mean exaclty 1024 smaller units, not just simply 1000. Because of this, they've adopted to calling 1000 Megabytes a Gigabyte, not 1024. This is apparent in everything from gmail (check the screenshot from the last post) to labels on hard drives. Now in the case of gmail, this doesn't seem that big, superficially it's only a loss of 201326592 bits (translates to 24 Megabytes), but consider the 200 Gigabyte hard drive that one of my friends bought a few months ago... Imagine if the makers had employed this "layman's gigabyte" but instead counted  every  multiple as simply 1000 not 1024... *grabs his calculator*   Now,  8 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 200 = 1717986918400 8 x 1000 x 1000 x 1000 x 200 = 1600000000000  The former subtracted by the latter is 117986918400 bits That divided by 8 is 14748364800 bytes That divided by 1024 is 14402700 kilobytes That divided by 1024 is 14065.13671875 megabyes That divided by 1024 is 13.735485076904296875 gigabytes  So what have we seen here? Societies' stuborn inability to grasp even slightly foreign concepts has cheated my friend out of   over 13 Gigabytes  .  Secondly, the word hacker... *looks at the clock* ... I'll append this post later.

       Saturday: Prom Night   I dont remember what time I actually got out of bed on Sat. but I think it was just past noon. My sister was at an all-nighter with her youth group and got back home around 2, by this time Id already showered and gotten my suit and everything basically ready. My sister needed a ride to my school at 3 for a fair so I took her over and stuck around for a bit to make sure some of her friends were there, then came back home.   I had eaten (my first meal of the day  lol) and gotten ready to go pick up Steven at 4pm, but Mahdi randomly showed up at our door. Now, a little background on Mahdi: We met him at the ethnic excuse-for-a church we attended almost all my life (well, actually we helped start it) until a couple years ago. Hes got some mental issues going on and my dads been trying to help him but Mahdis been getting into a lot of trouble with the police and other people lately. Like a week or so ago he randomly left his van in our driveway, with a brief note written to my dad, stuck on our door that said that his roommate had been giving him trouble. That was all. (Btw, he still has studs on his tires, several weeks after the latest date he can legally have them on.) Yeah, so anyway, he randomly showed up on our doorstep and started knocking on the door for something like six to ten minutes straight. I was the only one home and just ignored him; didnt let him know I was there. I was sitting in the kitchen eating and a thought occurred to me Hes persistent enough; he might come up on the deck. I though for sure that he wouldnt but there still was a possibility, and I needed to do something in my room anyway, so I took my food (leftovers from Wus Open Kitchen) and went down to my room to finish eating it. Almost the second I walked into my room, I heard Mahdi walking up the steps to the second story deck, right where I was moments ago. I called my dad and asked him if hed told Mahdi that he could come over and he told me just the opposite that he had told him specifically  not  to come. Yeah, I waited like twenty minutes and went back upstairs again (with a gun on my belt) and saw that he had gone and taken his van, but he left a 20 thousand dollar silk Persian rug on top of our cathouse outside Yeah whatever, odd fellow.  Anyway, because of this I was close to half an hour late picking up Steven. On the way to Beckys we picked up a camera from Cams house because my dad had mine and I hadnt seen my parents in two days so I couldnt get it from him. (Weird schedules where everyones asleep when I get home and everyones gone when I wake  lol)  We finally arrived at Beckys at 5:30 instead of 5:00 like we had planned, but twas all good cause Danie and Jon arrived just after us too. Mary and Mandy were busy doing Beckys hair so Danie, Jon, Steven, Edwin and I picked prolly the oddest of the  several hundred or so VHSs there  Yomega Yo Zone lol, It was a yo-yo infomercial type thing that we guessed and later confirmed, came with a yo-yo. Then came hanging around waiting for food to cook, eating and changing. (lol) I forgot a belt so I had to borrow one from Beckys mom. After that were couple and group pictures and driving to the random ballroom in Portland: Steven, Becky, Edwin and Mary in Beckys moms car, and Danie, Jon, Mandy and I in Mandys moms.  Once we got there just after it started at 8, one of the first things I noticed was the candy buffet on several huge tables in the first room, there were massive (Im talking like two cubic feet+) bowls of Skittles, M&Ms and other things. When we got to the dance floor we hung back for a bit for some reason and then decided to start right as the slow songs started. (lol) Slow dancing was kinda scary but fun  sorta weird to do it with someone whos just a friend, but yeah, twas fun. Then the at the first fast song, Baby Got Back, Steven and I were like Uh, were not dancing to this which was all good cause our dates picked that moments to run off with each other, so we went back to our table (LOL). The rest of the next hour or two was spent dancing again, but up in the back of the higher of the two-tiered stage. Cotton Eye Joe came on and all 70 or so of us up there started a massive line dance. So great haha. But yeah, I think eventually the six of us in our group that were up there got tired of the ear-shattering loudness and the heat, even though there was an industrial fan blowing on stage (girls randomly lifting their dressed in front of it or maybe by it whatever) and went back to our table. More walking and picture taking for half an hour and then we finally organized everyone and got group and couple shots. The group shot was interesting, the photographer was trying to fit four of us on a really tiny bench, and eventually just had Mandy and Becky sit on Stevens and my leg. Seemed really uncomfortable for the poor girls, they were almost falling off (lol, but the picture turned out good, so *yay*).  Around 11:30, when it officially ended, we all walked outside and waited for the moms to walk back from wherever it was that they were. They ended up needing to use the restroom so we waited some more, and while we were, some self-proclaimed pervert walked up and started asking us to all pose for a picture. (lol) He kept commenting about Beckys hair then after her took the picture some random lady with him started asking us what our addresses were and if we wanted copies of the picture. Were all like Um, you said youre a perv, go away then once the moms got back down we went next door to the parking garage and some random college guys started hitting on the girls and walked around a corner out of sight. When our elevator opened, we realized it was glass and they were hanging around the outside. To bad for them, all the girls dressed were floor-length, though Edwin was going to moon them (LOL)   Sunday: The after-party, Cams house, and hearing Mr. Weber preach   We made it to Sherri's ordered our food, ate, and tried many different inventive ways of asking for the check when we realized that it was past 2am, more than two hours from when wed arrived (LOL) - They were way understaffed. Poor waitress though, she was running around like mad.  When we arrived back at Beckys house, Steven and I went inside and grabbed our stuff and everyone else took off to take other people home.   *sigh* That was a really fun night despite the hotness and cramped-ness of the ballroom. For the record, I think my date (Mandy) looked beautiful and am really happy she invited me.  Side not: I saw a friend Hannah that I hadn't seen in... prolly more than 7 years... she got a picture with me but I forgot to get ond with her... should somehow get in touch with her and have her email it to me or something... Speaking of pictures, I'm prolly going to wait till I have some better pics (prolly scan of other people's and scans of the professional pics) before I post any... I don't have the camera with me and I didn't like the pictures I took.  I spent the next hour or so on the road taking Steven home, going home myself to get a belt (lol) and arriving at Cams house past 3:30am.  The first thing I noticed when I got to Cams house was the silhouette of someone with an AEG automatic weapon aimed out his window at my car, and the second thing I noticed was the automatic weapon firing rounds at my car  with very very good aim (or bad aim, depending on what he was aiming for Im assuming he was trying to hit  near  my car, but not actually  hit  my car. My only means of defense was my  million candle power spotlight, so a standoff was reached; every time theyd shoot at me, Id blind them and every time I blinded them, theyd shoot at me (LOL) This only ended when Andrew called me and I told him to send Cam out to help my carry my bags up (lol).  We didnt really do much, just talked till 5am then fell asleep. Cam woke me up at 9:45 but I didnt actually get up until 10:15, right as Adri called me to see if I was coming to a tiny Baptist church three blocks from Beckys house where Mr. Weber was preaching. He had told us last week that he was going to preach there and had tried to get as many people to come with him because the church was full of old people (LOL). So, we did and we highschoolers outnumbered the regulars two to one. When Weber was done preaching he called the 60+ year old Frank No-So-Hotra (LOL!!) up to give an announcement. Everyone applauded in hilarious agreement though when Weber proclaimed that Frank actually was hot. Man that guys so funny.  Later, I went back to Beckys house to return her moms belt. (lol) Before I knocked or rang the doorbell Becky opened it and our entire converstation went as follows:  Her: Dont *muffled, but it sounded close to ring the doorbell*. Me: Dont ring the doorbell? Her: Yeah my moms sleeping. Me: Ok, see yah. Her: Bye.

      Woot, I'm finally posting from my spiffy laptop hidden away in some remote corner of my house (My parents don't even know I have it ;) ). Yeah, anyway, the last couple days have been dandy for me...   Note:  All that stuff that I said about my mom, well I'm leaving it... I kinda have a policy here on my blog that once I post something, it stays 'cause that's how I felt when I wrote it and the whole purpose of a blog is kinda destroyed once one goes back and starts editing previous posts to conform them to their current frame of mind. Anyway, with that said and with the assurance that my mom and I are back on friendly terms again (We've fully discussed the incident(s) and have come to the conclusion that if given the chance to re-live them, we'd have done stuff differently), I'll go back to the part about the last couple days being dandy...   I got to drive my car again for the first time on Sunday! *Woot again!* I kinda ...erm, left early and went to Goodwill where I was extremely happy to find a connector for this laptop, the only part infact that has been preventing me from getting it on the web. Btw, I forget the processor speed, but it has 12Mb of RAM, a 154Mb HD, and a 640x480 display running at 256 colors. LOLOL Beastie machine huh? I can't believe it actually runs Trillian... and IE at the same time! Anyway, I finally got over to Calvary, stayed a while, saw Bwitty (that's always cool - she's fun to hang around), and finally saw Cam after almost two weeks... Man I was going through Cam-withdrawal (LOL) He was doing good, but now there's some stuff going on that's really screwing with him so... yeah sux.  Anyway, on Monday, I couldn't believe it; Gwen gave the message for Opening (our Monday morning chapel). I'm proud of her... that takes guts. It was about depression and conquering it through happiness in God's love... exactly the type of struggle I'm going through right now... and have been for the last two years infact. Yeah... Monday was awesome after that.  Today I got out of an entire day of school ('cept the last ten minutes of my last class) because we had an all-day field trip to the state capital, Salem. That was cool... during our trip to the actual capital building, they had an earthquake drill. That was pretty stupid; we didn't even know what it was... I was sliding down one of the huge marble ramp things on either side of the two flights of stairs (LOL, intended as decoration, not actually to slide down, though even out elderly tour guide admitted to having done so herself at one point..... HAHAHA), and some guy walked into the rotunda and blasted a blowhorn siren. We were all like 'um... wha..?' Yeah that was fun.  I've got a huge report for Spanish due... um today (hehe) that I'm having a very hard time completing... I don't get it, I have all the info at my fingertips, I just can't seem to compile it. Ah well, there's always tomorrow.  I talked to Mandy today too, FINALLY (lol) and we're still on for prom, same with Steven and Becky. Should be fun...  Goodnight world! I love  all  most of you :)

             Yeah it's been a bit since I posted last... Here are pictures of random happenings of late:   Mel's house tonight  *looks at clock* I guess it was last night actually. All the people in these pictures plus Gwen, YoungHee and Adri went to see Shrek 2... Fairly good movie actually, pretty funny. Later all of us minus Adri and YoungHee went back to Mel's (where the pics were taken) to watch Evil Alien Conquerors. Note I only happened to remember that I had my camera with me and subsequently use it   after   Gwen left, so though she isn't in any of the pictures, she was there with us most of the evening. o.O James, one of the guys in the pictures, gave me one of his shirts from back when he used to work at Wendy's! So cool... (lol)   My NEST group's last meeting on Friday  (a school mandated grouth group of sorts)   My cellphones on Thursday  (Note the plural... I got my phone replaced but forgot to back up the phone directory... It pays to have friends in Sprint: I got to keep them both for a day.)

      Listening to:  Plankeye - Call Me Liar    riddled with the pain of falling short i promised you i'd always try my hardest and do you think i'm trying no i wouldn't either call me liar call me anything you want my heart's on fire now everything is wrong flown and flung away the hardest sort don't think that i would hurt you by intention and do you think that i'm trying no i wouldn't be surprised call me liar call me anything you want i'm caught in the wires and everything is gone   Man, the last two days have been so surreal to me... especially Thursday night. I was crying for a variety of reasons almost the entire retreat - rarely actually in tears but my soul wept the entire time. Winema is always emotional for me, but this one was a thousand times more so. As I told someone, "I love/hated it"   Holy crap, I thought I was done, but no. (I'm crying again)

      I wrote this in 3rd period Senior English on Wed. when all the seniors were gone, going on the retreat one day early.    The Seniors    The times you've left me with Are all but passed me by, And you go on with life While I sit here and cry.  Eyes will dry, tears will pass And my life too will go on. Until that time, here, now, My mem'ries I'll ponder on.  For none can know what lies in store,      'Save but the great Divine Through trust in Him I'll tarry on,      On 'till the end of time.  And you with Him I know I'll meet      If never again shall see, Past the last day of this summer      When I a Senior, be.    Yeah, um... I was sad.

      The weirdest thing just happened to me... I was leaving my friend's house which happens to be four houses down from Mr. Olesen (my IT team leader)'s house and he started pulling out of his driveway. I passed him and a couple streets down he pulled alongside me because I was turning left and he was going straight. I waved at him but he didn't seem to recognize me and it was our turn to go, so I turned and continued on my way thinking I'd ask him at our next meeting if he realized later who it was. A tiny bit later, I turned left again onto TV Highway and started cruising in the left lane, when who should pull up alongside me, but... Mr. Olesen (lol) He motioned for me to pull over to the side of the road and started to do so himself so I followed suit by putting my turn signal on and starting to switch to his lane so I could get off onto the shoulder. Right at that moment some idiot it a raised pickup decided to gun it and swerve around him before he was even out of his lane, in the process cut off the person behind me and nearly collided with me. I swerved back into my lane as he roared past then signaled and finally got off onto the shoulder. Mr. Olesen saw the entire thing and had to drive up to meet me since I was a significant ways down the road after that idiot cut me off. The reason for all this was that he had loaned me a key to a storage unit that we were storing a ton of PCs in and needed it back - when he saw me he thought he'd come flag me down but "didn't anticipate almost getting me into a wreck" LOL

It's great for people like me and Steven... Though better for him than 'cause of his Pocket PC. Later I'll see about browsing their network, but I'm quite content now using it to simply connect to the web and get removal tools for whatever varient of Mydoom happens to be afflicting the laptop. Let their network get infected, not mine. *evil grin* ;) [/Edit]

      Powerful song that does a good job of capturing our youth's want-everything-now mindset (plus it's just plain beautiful)  Listening to:  Freshman - Verve Pipe    When I was young I knew everything She a punk who rarely ever took advice Now I'm guilt stricken, Sobbing with my head on the floor Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  My best friend took a week's Vacation to forget her His girl took a weeks's worth of Valium and slept And now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his Head on the floor Thinks about her now and how he never really Wept he says  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  hey yeah  hey yeah hey yeah   We've tried to wash our hands of all this We never talk of our lacking relationships And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our Heads on the floor We fell through the ice when we tried not to Slip, we'd say  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face And I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen We were merely freshmen

      Major prayer request: This is still just in the hear-say phase, but apparently an old friend of mine got accidently hit in the head by a flying baseball bat today and had to get 40+ stitches. 'Will keep people informed as I become informed, but chances are that a few of you already know more about it than I do.

      1. Go into your LJ's archives. 2. Find your 23rd post (or closest to). 3. Find the fifth sentence (or closest to). 4. Post the text of the sentence in your blog along with these instructions.    For the first hour or so, until Butters decided to show up, I was the only guy among, like 20 girls at the party.

      Listening to  Moby - Porcelain    In my dreams I'm dying all the time Then I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me... In my dreams I'm jealous all the time Then I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind   Wow, I just went back and re-read my  entire  blog for the first time in a couple months. A blog's alot like a picture album, though it's got more than just the good times in it. I've never really thought about it like that before.  At the beginning of the year I spend 10+ hours compiling a book-almost of my blog posts from the first time I posted to the end of last year. Heh, most of it's depressing, but that's alright because my life's been a depressing one so I guess it accurately mirrors it.  Eventually I will print it out and maybe even put it on the web I think its over a hundred pages (lol).

      Well I took the SAT 1s today... the math sections were a piece of cake, even though I *erm* forgot my calculator. (LOL) Adri was the only other person I know going to Beaverton to take it too and we somehow got into the same room. That was cool. I gave her a ride home and am looking forward to her party later tonight.  On Thursday our entire school up and went to see a play at Heritage called Happens Every Summer at 11:something. I love my school, so funny - mandatory play patronization. The play was pretty lacking in content, bad script choice, though the talent was wonderful. By the end of it I wanted to run up and punch the Georgian hoe (though the fact she was, after all, just an actress taking the form of the character held me back - LOL).   Thursday also, my mom had to take our orange cat Leo into be put down. Sux, but he's been in a ton of pain and stuff from his leg all his life so I guess it's a good thing. We got another cute cute black kitten a couple hours ago and my sister's occupying herself with that one now.  Speaking of pets, Gwen has to take Rascal, her dog, to the vet today at 2:30 to put her down too. Sux... That's gonna be a ton harder on her than my sister's cat has been on her since Gwen's had her dog for something like 12 years. Yeah, I'll see how she's doing at the party tonight I guess.   ... Heh, if I can go that is... My mom's being weird about homework again - might not let me go tonight.

      Listening to:  Taproot - Poem    overbearing panic attack entrenching my veins In an hour i'll be ok  I pray this pain will go away permanently someday  I'VE seen more than...

I'VE seen this on my own  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own... your own...  reoccurring drowning effect entrenching my brain, I hope you'll be ok someday, so I can say that you moved on in the right way...

BREAK...  this song is a, poem to myself, it helps me to live...  in case of fire, BREAK the glass,  and move on into your own...   Well, today was enjoyable. 'Got up around 10 o'clock, took a shower, headed to CCWC for the first time in ... forever. I saw Sarah (Steven's gf) for the second time there, the first was in Jan. (I think - lol) Later I ran into the Gadeholts and Ben, and followed them over to the Gadeholt's house where I stayed until past 9. Well, that's not entirely true, I did go with them to pick up Kat from Washington square and to go eat at Xtine's restraunt... but that doesn't count since I was with them.   Man, that was fun... I miss my sophmore year.

      Well, I went to  PCC 's youth group tonight. 'Twas a special service because their 80-person choir just got back from a tour in Cali - only went to 8 o'clock. There was a party afterwards at someone's house till 10... LOL That was a huge amount of cars for that small a street. It was only like 70 out, and some crazy people jumped into the pool anyway... the spa I understand, but not the pool.  Afterward, while I was driving home on TV highway, west of 170th, I saw a photo-radar vehicle on the side of the road and immediately checked my speed... under 55, so I didn't slow down. When I passed it though, the thing flashed and when I got home I checked with my mom and apparently that section of road's 45, not 55. Gayness... whatever, so I guess I have my first ticket... I'm upset, but not about the ticket so much as how little the thing was that I got it for... I wanted my first ticket to be for going 120 in a 45 or something like that...   Oh well.

      Listening to:  Story of the year - Sidewalks   I should prolly get to bed eventually. (lol) Yesterday morning I stayed up untill past 6am I think... Doubt that I'll repeat that this morning, but I'm well on my way.  I didn't really do anything today 'cept work on assorted computer stuff and clean my room(s). I removed that LAN I had running secretly into my upstairs room because I'm moving entirely down here and if I ever need it again, it's quite easy to reinstall... just need another half-hour with the house to myself.  Oh, Brent called me right after 11 tonight (... technically last night) and said that Tyler had run over to Bally but it had gotten dark and he needed a ride. Brent would have done it, but he was sick, so I got to get out of the house to give him a ride... I LOVE driving at night... hot nights. I'm getting better at driving with my knees; nothing beats blazing down TV highway at 70+ with the seat reclined and your hands behind your head with the windows down and the music blazing at midnight on a hot summer night. ;)  Dos cervesas~ ('two beers' in Spanish)

      I very *heart* this song...    Story of the Year - Sidewalks    The bridge is all crumbled.  The water soaks into rocks  that fell at the bottom of the road (At the end of the town.) The town that we lived in.  The memories shaken apart from the weeds that grow  Over the sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  Or   Out on the front porch,  watching the cars as they go by (Eighteen blue, twenty one grey)  Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive,  Out on our own,  To speed away   From the sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  Or   All of the days have passed us by,  All of the sun is gone... away.   Sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,   Sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  (Sidewalks)  The bridges are crumpled,  (Sidewalks)  The water soaks into rocks,  That fell at the bottom of the road.

      I really, REALLY need to update about the last week and a half and I'm at summer school and a poster I noticed up on the wall of all the graduates walking down the isle almost two weeks ago inspired me to finally come back and update this (lol).  Friday... I got to the last day of school at the beginning of the LAST PERIOD... I had set my phone (my suto-alarmclock) on vibrate the night before for my sister's 8th grade grduation, so when it went off to wake me up, it well... vibrated. My parents apparenly didn't see the wisdom in actually venturing into my room untill close to noon, but rather, repeatedly called my phone, which again, was on vibrate. When I got to school, I handed in a project and took a test, neither of which were for the class that I had that period... and spent the rest of the time walking around school with my video camera.  Later that night was Faith's Senior Graduation. As is my custom, I videotaped that in its entirety as well. I'm thinking about encoding it in divx and pushing it out onto Kazaa via my neighbor's connection... Might eventually get around to it, might not too...  Anyway, after the graduation, I went home, spent time doing... something, dunno what but in any event I spent quite a while doing it... packed up my computer and finally arrived at the first of 8 or so graduation parties I would be attending from then till Sunday night (Jon-Mark's) at around midnight. Yeah, that was great fun :) Many hours of watching random videos and tv shows, all off my computer, through the night. Mel was funny, every little while she thought she was leaving... in a little while, but eventually she just ended up staying the entire night with us.  I went back to my house, or at least I think I went back to my house... not really sure... whatever, in any event, Jon-Mark, Darren and I went to several more grad parties on Sat, ending up at Eric Zoucha's that night... I had had no sleep for over 30 hours by this time and had been driving them around most of the day while they slept (lol) So it's completely understandable that I fell into a coma-like sleep on Eric's chair... and could not be wakened by any means whatsoever... well, understandable when you know that other time that I've fallen asleep like that, I've been shot with bb guns at point-blank and not waken up.  Anyway, they got a ride home with their dad, and I woke up past midnight at Eric's... I should have just stayed there, but I went back home. Many of us met up again at parties later Sunday, but I missed the one at their church that I wanted to go to.  That pretty much raps up the graduation weekend... on to more events of the week in further posts.

      Well I just woke up about 10 minutes ago... realized taht I've missplaced my glasses and don't feel like putting my contacts in, so I'm sitting back in my chair, for all practical purposes blind to the computer, touchtyping a post (lol). Wow, I think that was  along sentence but I'm not sure because I don't feel like quinting to read it ;) Speaking of touchtyping, I recal a time steven was here, turned around looking at my tv, talking to me, and still typing IMs behind his back  ... he just wanted me to mention that ;) (It did really happen though)  TO give you an idea of how late I've been getting to bed lately, I got to bed at 12:30 last night and it took three hours+ for me to get to sleep. LOL The start of summer school was this morning... I didn't make it... woke up at 2:30pm  I'm realizing now that I haven't really posted anything realivant to anything going on lately for the past week+ soI'm going to do taht, provided I find my glasses and/or contacts in a timely manner (lol)  For now, goodbye~

              pics from today   Yeah, so today was the Seniors' last day at school, plus Senior Wills as an end of day assembly. I got willed a senior star (something put on their locker at the beginning of the year... special way to remember the person by when you get one willed to you) by Matt and Gwen, a t-shirt with paint on it from Lenny (from when we painted that church way back when...), some almost-finished bombs from our Chem. class from Gwen, and print of some of YoungHee's amazing artwork from... er... YoungHee. (lol)  I'm gonna ty to get my scanner online sometime tonight and post a scan of the print.  Later tonight I attended my sister Azita's 8th grade graduation.  Man school tomorrow's going to suck really bad and the graduation itself's not going to be much better. I shall be much crying. Hopefully the graduate's receptions later that night and the following day will cheer me up temporarily though.

       What if he was cradling a gun in his hands, mumbling, "Myyy preeeciousss" while he was walking around. I bet he wouldn't get mugged then.   o.O LOL!  ...found in  http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/30/2252233&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=137&tid=172 (a discussion about what geeks can do to help protect themselves and their valuables from muggers)  more comments on the topic:   In the UK, you are not allowed to own a gun, let alone carry one. Not even the cops carry fireamrs.  HALT! Or I'll be forced to yell HALT again, but louder!    --------------------------------------------------    That's not too far off from what I do. It's not jock-style, but it works for me.  I'm 6'2" tall, I have long black hair, a bullring style nose ring, a scuffed black leather jacket, a motorcycle and a visible knife clipped to my pocket.  I don't dress like I have money, and if I have to walk through a bad neighborhood, I make sure I look angry. My friends and I can walk past a gang, and they tend to part like the Red Sea.  I'm the scariest looking sysadmin I've seen in corporate america.     --------------------------------------------------    I have a friend that real life role plays. He was dressed up in his medieval armor and cloak garb waiting at a train station one day. A mugger came up to him with a 4 inch knife and said "give me your wallet". My mate stared him in the face and moved his cloak to reveal a 30 inch long sword. "I see your 4 and raise you 26". Should have seen him run.    --------------------------------------------------    I had a mugging problem when I was in San Francisco. Got mugged twice before I realized that muggers are very predictable. They like their targets to be predictable as well. I found that wearing a dirty shrunken wool jacket I got from goodwill, carrying extra bags, and yelling at people that wearen't there was a great way to avoid getting mugged.

       Excerpts from Paul Graham's ' Great Hackers ' essay:    "I've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two articles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not. And the second could probably be condensed into two words: give up."  "Really good hackers are practically self-managing. The problem is, if you're not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are. A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. I call it the design paradox. You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. But if you yourself don't have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer?"  "Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers."  "One place this happens is in startups. At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system administrator. That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah. You can't hire that kind of talent. But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders."  "They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why. I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft. And of course if Microsoft is your model, you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software. But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM."  "So who are the great hackers? How do you know when you meet one? That turns out to be very hard. Even hackers can't tell. I'm pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his own Segway. The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally). For Trevor, that's par for the course. But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot. He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his office so we could go to lunch. Robert says he misjudged Trevor at first too. Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere. He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet."  "With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell. That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects. When you get to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn pretty quickly how hard they hit them back. But hackers can't watch themselves at work. So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know. He's not just being modest. He really doesn't know.  "If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including him."     Greg Knauss 's rebuttle found on  waxy.org  :    You know what a hacker is? It's someone who enjoys solving problems. Great hackers do it elegantly. Good hackers do it at all. How they do it is irrelevant, and it certainly has nothing to do with what language they choose or what OS they run or if they're politically correct or not. To claim otherwise is arrogant, narrow-minded foolishness.  The fact that I'm learning C# and Windows.Forms does not make me any less of a hacker. In fact, it makes me more of one, because I'm able to solve a problem I couldn't with all the Python and Linux in the world. Oh, but I forgot: hackers only solve the problems that interest them, if they're presented in the right way and in the right environment. Because hackers are special.    also found on  waxy.org  :     Joshua  pointed out that while it may seem that every smart person I know is using open-source tools, it's a product of observational bias. Open-source programmers hang out with other open-source programmers. I don't know many Windows applications developers, so I've never met a Windows super-genius. But they exist, and to say they don't is a form of technophobic racism.

      "You just defaced property of the US government! ...You rebel" -Scully to Mulder  I woke up pretty late today... almost 11 or so, and headed over to school to get some work done. Jen and I were talking to Mel via IM around 2 and she invited us to come over to Washington Square for a bit with her friend whose name suddenly escape me and the friend's boyfriend, Joe. Anyway, we went sperately, and when I got there, I found them up at the Summit foodcourt getting well, food. (lol) I asked them where they lived and they responded Beaverton and North Plains and we were talking about how they were similar to Danie and Jon cause they live about the same distance away when I look up and see... Danie. LOL It took about ten minutes for any of the to notice us, but Danie, Jaime, their mom, their cousins and Jon were all there.            When we were done eating and such, we went down to Victoria's Secret to see if Cherry was there... Alas, she wasn't so we went across to the Mac store and messed with their computers. Now, anyone that knows anything about the difference between Macs and PCs knows that Windows cannot be installed on a Mac... at least not without an emulator, but that's complicated and a lot of people have no idea how to do that. Anyway, following Steven's example from the last time, I remote logged into first my computer and then both Steven's and my computers so it looks to the untrained eye, like the Macs have windows on them. I got a lot of strange looks. ;)

      I went to sleep this morning at around 4am and woke up somewhere around 8am. I spent like 45 minutes in the shower and so doing, made everyone slightly late to church. The little church we were going to is on the East side... just ten or so blocks away from my uncle's house. When we arrived there, we discovered that the service was going to be starting a bit later, so my sisters and I drove over to my uncle's house while mom practiced (she was playing for the service at the request of an old friend who attends the church). My uncle ended up not being home, so we called him and via his directions, met him and Natalia at a cafe a quarter mile away. That was fun, especially since I hadn't seen him in a month (due to his having been in Europe). We talked for a while, mostly about the impending divorce. I love talking to my uncle, granted he leans pretty leftwing-liberal in his thinking; he's got a good head on his shoulders and is very insightful.  My sisters and I ordered some breakfast along with them and only then discovered that the service was starting a lot earlier than we had thought. Eventually we got back to the church and quietly entered during the sermon... unfortunately for us, Mom and my Aunt were sitting in the very front, and I was wearing by far the brightest shirt in the building ;) Whatever, later my mom had us stand up while she introduced us, so attention wasn't to be avoided anyway.   Later, once the service was over, we got to meet my mom's friend's daughter Deanna her friend Patricia. Patricia happened to be their old foreign exchange student from Germany and was back visiting them (or at least, that's how I understood it).  Anyway, the plan was for us to all go to the Kabob Khaneh (Kabob House) in Beaverton, and my sisters and I rode along with Deanna and Patricia. That was fun... when I first got in the car the radio was playing Verve Pipe - The Freshman. Deanna and I immediately starting singing along with it to the other rider's consternation... LOL  We ate, walked around a bit, took pictures (which one or both of them hopefully will be emailing to me soon so I get them up here...) and got ice cream and Hagendaz (spl?) Deanna's dad had some type of PDA that had a hangman game on it... that was a source of entertainment for a bit too. (lol)  Deanna and Patricia are really fun to hang around... wish we lived a little closer to each other, though Patricia is going back to Germany fairly soon so that's event further than the East side (LOL) Apparently Deanna's an amazing artist... she mentioned something about getting space in a gallery on this side of the river that we passed by... I should ask her about that.  We parted company around 2:30pm or so and we headed back home, and Pat came over shortly there after. We set around for a while and eventually got some flowers and headed over to Adri's house (who just got her wisdom teeth out a couple days ago...) She's feeling better, but still looks like a self-described chipmunk (lol). She wanted me to take a picture of her and post it, but we forgot about it... maybe tomorrow or something.  Yeah and the rest of the day's been rather boring now that Pat left...

      Yeah... for some reason some of us felt like skipping youth group yesterday so we had a party at my house. I was talking to Sara last week and she mentioned going to see the Bourne Supremacy, Thursday night at midnight, so I thought why not have everyone else come too? Unfortunately Mandy, Adri, Katy V and Steven weren't able to be out that late for one reason or another so they came to the party but didn't come with Mel, Katie, Matt R, Josh H, Andrew, Pat, Allen and I to the movie.  The party was interesting... we watched two different movies at the same time, The Bourne Identity (since it's rather essential to see before seeing the sequel) and Good Burger. Then arm wresting and... er... leg wresting - something I'd never seen before.  The movie was fairly good... great plot, but I hated the ending and the cinematography during some of the action scenes was heavily annoying... infact the final chase scene was downright boring as a result.  Pat, Matt, Andrew and Josh stayed overnight afterward... we watched Kill Bill - strange, strange movie (directed by the same person that did Pulp Fiction) one of the scenes had to be black and white just to avoid an NC-17 rating. LOL  We woke up at noon or so and I took Andrew to work shortly there after... Then we that remained had fun shooting some bottles and fences and... houses with Pat's AEGs. Then came the water balloons... that kept us occupied for a couple hours (it's just a couple degrees shy of 100 today). I finally pegged a car that I was trying to hit for a while then we focused our effort on more... shall we say, mobile targets.  Josh, Matt and Pat left around an hour ago and I'm in my room listening to  American Hi-Fi - Nothing Left to Lose

      My piece of sh*t motherboard is yet again having issues with my videocard so my primary computer is out of comission until I have the initiative to remove every component and power it back up sequentially 'till it decides that it's no longer broken.  Gay computer.  On sunday, as you already know from the previous post, I woke up late and went to a local school where some friends of mine were hainging out. After everyone dispersed, Pat and I went over to Adri's to bug her and kill time before he had to be at college group at Pr. Drew's house. I decided to be adventurous and see if Drew would let me come too (though I'm still a senior) and after many inventive ways of finding his phone number, I finally was able to ask, and he yes, it was fine to visit it that night. I followed Pat over, driving my dad's ber spiffy car (hehe).   Yeah, that was a great night... been a long time since I played Mau with Sara & Beth(LOL) There were a ton of people there that I know but had no idea went there.  At the end of the night, Greg Anderson and I were talking ... mostly about my family and stuff, and I mentioned that it's like they're divorced, but still living together, infact if it weren't for us, they would be divorced. He had trouble hearing me and asked "but they're not actually divorced right?" ... Little did I know.  ... Which brings me to my next news flash... My parents are getting a divorce. I was informed that night when I got home ironically.  Man, I really wish I could join that college group... I need some people like them in my life right now.

      First, let me comment that blogger  again  has changed slightly for the better... but just the backend, so all you non-bloggers can't see what I'm talking about.   Second... Peter and Solana are gone, GONE... kinda. (lol) They be in Aussyland now. Here are some pictures from the airport today around 6-7ish:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      I had picked up Andrew and met Brady and Pat at CCWC to carpool out to Peter's to pick him up and go to the airport, so we (-Peter) went back to CCWC afterward, a bit after youth group started. Brady left cause he's old (lol), but Pat, Andrew and I stayed... at first in the 'Nursing Mom's room' (which is really tight... there'a one-way mirror so you can see/hear everything that's going on in the sanctuary but no one can see/hear you. Eventually though, the senior high went upstairs, so we followed, but skipped shortly there after (-Pat, +Matt &amp; Josh H) and went to Freddy's. On the way back we ran into the rest of our clique and here are pictures from then on:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Now for the stupidness... I had some spraypaint in my car which we had been lead to believe was water soluble. Someone had sprayed a big smily face on one side of the parking lot and we had set a big firework off ontop of it. Nothing much more happened for a while and almost everyone left. We were starting to get a bit more crazy (lighting firecrackers off between people's feet and such... LOL@Adri) when I got the great idea of writing some random words on the parking lot like L337 H4x0r and stuff... (lol). About that time, Steven needed to use the restroom and since everywhere else was closed, he went over to the gas station across TV highway. While he was walking over, Andrew set of another bomb we had made and crap, that thing was LOOOOOOOOOUD. Steven said he heard it echoing off the theater and other buildings more than a block away while he was walking across the highway. 'Twas so loud infact, that we pretty much told everyone still around that they should leave... NOW. (worried about cops)   Anyway, I was taking Andrew and Steven home... and Steven wasn't there, so we cruised around and eventually found him. We decided to go back to the parking lot after a bit whe we new it was safe and realized that the spraypaint and stuff prolly wasn't going to come off as easily as we thought. We spent the next hour (up till almost midnight) trying different things, even going over to a 7-11 to get Coke to see if it'd lift the paint. ... Nothing worked.   Here are some pictures of the mess:     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Yeah... that was increadibly stupid. I called the church office asking someone to call me back tomorrow *looks at clock*... today to see about how I could help clean it up.   'Ne wayz, I'm tired and it may not look like it, but it actually takes an increadible long time to post all those pictures correctly, so I'm going to bed.

             Yeah, I got an earing today... Summer school's gonna be interesting: my school's got this thing about guys and earings... they hate them. (lol) Apparently though I can get away with wearing a band-aid over it... don't ask me, I'm not the one that made up the rules. ;)  In other news:   Scheduled Downtime    We are planning to have 2 hours of downtime tomorrow night, July 13, between 8p-10p (Pacific Time). Blogging should resume as normal after 10p.  Jason G. [7/12/2004 04:36:27 PM]

It's really cool... there's a huge open reservoir (several hundred feet to a side) with banks going up to 100 feet tall... would be an awesome place to set off some mortars. There's also a wide street that no one uses yet that's awesome to try out skids and stuff on.  'Ne way, after that, I met Andrew and Jon at Wu's (a Chinese restaurant) and then went back to Andrew's for a night of fun. (lol) I just got home several minutes ago and felt like posting, so here I am...  Actually, I'm not that tired... that's not a good thing since I've slept through summer school this entire week. :P

      Yeah... I was at Darren and Jon-Mark's today for their joint birthday party... I *ahem* only found out that it was a party for  both of them  after I got there, so I only got Darren a present. (Sorry Jon, yours is coming - lol) Darrens birthday was today, Jon's is this Sat.  Btw, I'm operating like yesterday is actually 'today' again on account of my not having slept yet, so Darren's b-day is actually on the 8th.  I didn't get any pictures or anything because my mom has the camera at the moment... and I just found out today that my dad's taking our camcorder with him on his month-long trip to Iran in a week; a fact that I'm none to pleased about and that has me working like mad dumping footage onto my computer and editing it before he takes it.  Whatever... I've got summer school tomorrow morning and I've slept though it every other day this week so I'd better get off and at least try to get to sleep.  G'night world~

      Here's the pics and video from Adri's party...  7-2-04, 7-3-04 sleepover (33:46)  urlLink divx 233Mb  If you don't have the divx codec, get it! (you can find the latest version  urlLink here )                                                                                On Monday I went up to Brady's house for what was supposed to be another going-away party for Peter, but alas, Peter himself could not make it. (LOL) Anyway, Pat, Brady, Cori and I just hung out for a while. That was pretty fun. While I was up there, I tried to dl that fireworks video from last post and decided that I wanted to make a short video of just the cooler stuff fireworks that we set off this weekend, so here it is:  Cool fireworks (1:53)  urlLink divx 12.8Mb   Then, yesterday (the 6th... I haven't slept tonight - still consider today the 7th) James 'became a number'. LOL He joined the Navy... Jen, MJ, Melissa, Darren and I went to MEPS to meet him and his gf, Jessica, and went with him to the airport to see him off.                                             Andrew and I were talking afterward and apparently he still is really thinking about going SEAL... the only issue is his eyes, but he prolly can get Lasic surgery. I've got the same problem as far as joining the SEALs, and we're both thinking that if the draft does get re-instated next year that we're going to enlist.  Today, I woke up really late for some reason... totally missed summer school (lol). I went to my math teacher's house for a party with my Calc class at 7pm. It was to finish watching LotR RotK, we'd finished the class early and were trying to watch all three movies before school was out, but we didn't make it in time, so Miss O, being the awsome teacher she is, invited us over to finish it. Everyone but Gwen and Danie came (we had a small class).

      Ok, this is the first set of a long train of movies and pictures that I'm going to be posting in the near future...  7.4.04 illegal fireworks (24:48)  urlLink low 5.39Mb   urlLink med 18.1Mb   urlLink high 40.7Mb   I highly suggest a download manager like  urlLink Getright .  A word of caution too: these files are hosted off my home connection... If they become too much of a burden on my bandwidth, I'll take them down. So whenever possible, please try to keep your downloading to night time.  Oh, and sorry about the wmv format... I would encode them in something a little more cross-platform, but for all its failings, Windows Movie Maker does have the ability to compress video to insanely small files... and it only encodes in wmv. Contact me for a divx version of any of the movies and I'll post it if it's needed.  Thanks :)

      Listening to:  Story of the Year - Razorblades    Yeah, Yeah Walking example of you Wait for the silence Talking backwards to you It meant nothing to me Watching the world fall on you I'm keeping my eyes closed Now I can see what this means to you It meant nothing to me  [Chorus] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  Perfect timing for you You'll run 'til your legs break So here's my reminder of you It meant nothing to me  [Chorus] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end...GO!  We should've seen this coming We should've seen this... YEAH! YEAH!  [Chorus x2] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  YEAH! This is the END!   The last couple days have been awesome! Partying non-stop... On the 1st, Spiderman at the Redshaw's house then Spiderman II at the theater (good movie btw, I'm never watching the first one by itself again), then afterward back to the Redshaw's, then to Wendy's. And yeah Darren, the people sitting beside us were prolly confused as heck... ROFL ... Good times, good times. Anyway, after eating, a firework at the Redshaw's again then off to their youth group (short but fun). Still after, walking all over the place, hanging out with Tye, who I've not seen in years (at least I think...) and then finally blowing up a big firework in front of Matt R's unsuspecting house somewhere close to 11.  Then on the 2nd... Getting to summer school late, staying until 2, giving Kat a ride to Neil's house... playing pool and badminton for a while, then picking up Steven from his work and getting over to Adri's house past 5:30. Basically everyone from our circle of friends at school was there save Gwen who happened to have left for a couple-week long mission trip the same morning. We sneaked into the garage and surprised them by coming in through the back of the house... that was great fun. At some point we were messing around outside and someone stuck Adri in a compost recycling bin (ensuing chaos and funness... like the owners of the bin coming out of their house and us fleeing, and the girls getting into a water fight which led to them getting into the hot tub in the back). Josh and I went back to our houses and got several swimsuits, and we and Steven joined them. Then pizza and the fireworks....   HAHAHAHA... that was great too; I constructed a petebomb that had an actual piccolo pete as the igniter... Everyone had been warned to stay back and cover their ears - it would be loud, but the fuse took a while to work so when the peter finally caught they started to relax and think that that was the only thing going to happen... hehe, like I planned it. *evil grin* Then, without warning, BOOM the thing blew up and the entire cul-de-sac (spl?) was filled with little crackling fireballs. LOL that was so funny.  After this, Steven, Josh, Darren, and I came up to my house quickly (kinda...) to make a couple more bomb-style fireworks which we eventually lit off in the LDS stakehouse parking lot later by ourselves (the plan was for everyone else to come after we'd set it up and watch, but Adri's mom wouldn't let them. It was huge... we attached three 'normal-sized' bombs together.  We took Josh and Josiah back home less than a minute before their curfew and headed back to Adri's where we found a disgruntled crowd amiss at not having witnessed the big firework... so we took a walk all the way to Josh's house (but didn't go in... his dad didn't want him up... then continued to our English teacher's house outside of which we set and talked for a while and finally headed home and found Rachel, Jen and Mandy in the hot tub.  At this point, Steven and I were the only guys left and we didn't feel like leaving so ... er, we didn't (lol). I eventually got back into the hot tub only to get right back out again to go back up to my house to grab my glasses, contacts kit and chargers / batteries for both cameras and my phone (which everyone had killed by talking to Josh for over an hour - lol).   We just hung out and watched movies until like 7 or 8am when some people went back over to pick up Josh and Josiah again. Steven had to be at Sarah's at noon, and hadn't packed yet so I took him home shortly there after, and went back to my house and crashed around 9... Thus ending yet another co-ed sleepover. (lol)   I woke up past 6pm, took a shower, left, got gas, and arrived at Peter's in Forest Grove close to 9. Everyone just got back from an hour of warwalking a few minutes after, so I came at a good time. We spent a couple hours constructing and setting off fireworks... we got pretty crazy t'word the end... just dumping everything we could get out hands on into cinderblocks and throwing lit fireworks into them... hehe  *I wonder if the sparkler writing's still on the ground...*  I finally left past close to 2am and decided that I was going to do that speed test of my car right then and there... was tired of trying to set up a time for people to film me doing it. ;) But... after passing the second police car and encountering a lot of traffic on highway 8 before I even got to the section I was going to test on, I decided to call it off. I made up for it though by going 90mph on Rosedale and 110mph on 175th. :D ... That was great fun.  I'm sitting at home writing this right now, getting ready to head over to the Neff's for yet another evening of fun and fireworks...  I've got pictures of the last several days and I'm working on compressing the video I shot so I can get it up on my server... those will be up within a couple days pending the approval of everyone [read: the girls] who was at the sleepover that might be finnicky about it.  Bye everyone, cya ya'll soon enough~

       This is highly amusing...   A short list of my favorite 'things not allowed to do':   33. Not allowed to chew gum at formation, unless I brought enough for everybody.   34. (Next day) Not allowed to chew gum at formation even if I *did* bring enough for everybody.   58. The following words and phrases may not be used in a cadence- Budding sexuality, necrophilia, I hate everyone in this formation and wish they were dead, sexual lubrication, black earth mother, all Marines are latent homosexuals, Tantric yoga, Gotterdammerung, Korean hooker, Eskimo Nell, we've all got jackboots now, slut puppy, or any references to squid.  84. Must not use military vehicles to Squish' things.   87. If the thought of something makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am to assume that I am not allowed to do it.   94. Crucifixes do not ward off officers, and I should not test that.   100. Claymore mines are not filled with yummy candy, and it is wrong to tell new soldiers that they are.   106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CDs.   118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires - therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.   132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.   145.

      We got up this morning and vacated our crappy motel pretty quickly. My mom had gone out on a walk with Cynthia, her friend who lives locally in San Fransisco, and had just come back when we my sisters and I were waking up. We left our car at the Cynthia's and walked down the Fisherman's Wharf where we caught a tour ferry and rode around the bay for an hour and a half. Then we walked up to Ghiradelli Square, had lunch and stopped in at Cynthia's house for a while. She has a projector, screen and surround sound system in her bedroom! :) :) Exiting the city, we drove down Lombard street (the windiest street in the U.S.).  It took us over 6 hours to drive to LA (well, actually Vernonia - an LA suburb that Six Flags is located in). It's interesting: we've driven  exactly  1000.1 miles from my front door to the front of this hotel... We've got a picture to prove it. :)The hotel that I'm staying's within sight of Six Flags in a major way... it's like the only thing you can see looking out the windows (hehe)  Btw, my sisters and mom are trying to sleep so they kicked me out of the room and into the bathroom where I'm finishing up this post now ;)

      This is getting pretty rediculous... We reserved a room with this hotel here but they somehow overbooked, so they sent us to another hotel which didn't have room either, so now we're back again and have been wating for... over an hour... this is really starting to piss me off.

      Well, here we are screaming down the road at over 100mph.. My mom's at the wheel and it feels like we've got a couple jatos strapped to our butt. Our average speed's been around 85-90 the  entire way  out of Portland. It seems the max we've had to slow down had been to 70 in heavy ish  traffic. A bit ago we stopped in Redding to change our windshield wipers (yes, it was actually raining earlier, though the windshield's been coated with an enzime that stops rain from sticking so you almost don't even need the wipers). I picked up a pair of sunglasses for 99 cents (hehe). If they last me the rest of the week, they'll have been worth it.  Btw, I've had my eyes closed for most of this post... (spl check works wonders)

      Listening to:  Unwritten Law - Blame it on Me   Well, we're sitting here in the car on the highway just south of Roseburg... sitting, not really driving. (lol) The bright orange "Wreck Ahead" signs littering the side of the road and the fact that the left lane's blocked off with cones offers some explanation as to why.   This laptop's starting to become an annoying weight on my legs so I might put it down soon but I don't really feel like it yet.  Yeah, we just passed the accident site... from the looks of it, a 'fifth wheel' camper came off its frame and fell onto the road.

       No one has joined yet, because I've only just sent the invites but its new year in roughly 4 hours I think? Next year we have GCSE's and then starting collage/6th Form. How calming. LOL. Stress stress stress! Perhaps we should all take up yoga? Or learn another language fluently so that if we fail really badly we can move to that country and be a whole new person. Wouldn't that be quite good, if when your life got so bad you could just step out of it and into a whole new one! Brilliant.  Well, people, blog!!!!

Last year he went on a trip to Germany for the Christmas Markets, we have just got the photos back, and we have cellings, we have floors, we have parts of the human body (mainly feet and hands) and to top it all off we have a photo of the toilet on the coach. Amazing photography from my brother. If you want a high-resolution picture of the toliet (big enough to go on your desktop) please do contact me.  Something not quite right about that paragraph...

Everyone, I am adding a new nickname to my internet and text etc.. nickanmes: from now on, as wlel as Nicki, Nick, Sodapop and Emu I will be known as, NIKKO. Heehee.

       Aaaaaahhhhh, parents evening. My dad forgot most of it by the time he got home.  I ya want my opinion, the firefighters can strike for as long as they want, because the government are not going to increase their salaries by that much. Any twats that arnt careful and start fires when there are strikes can burn coz its their fault for doing it in the first place. The war I dont care about either. America are prepared to launch at minumum 400 missiles a day. Anyway, if the war starts when i'm out in America, wheyyyyy! We either: die. or stay out there until it ends :)  Toodles people, I hope you enjoyed my extremley motivational speech.

       Thats cool Tom, I think it looks good, because it creates the picture you want to see but has differnet effects and its own frame even! Wicked!  Well since I got home I have been playing about with my new 6 in 1 hair straightener. I love the curler and have been trying out leavers ball hairstyles! Yipeee. I gave up an hour ago though, kinda burnt my hand about 3 times or so.    I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.  It won't be canceled. War cannot be canceled, postproned but never canceled.

       I have (sort of) managed to scan in some photos and put them together to give you the view outside of my hotel when I went to Italy. The quaility isn't very good and the lighting conditions change in each photo, and I am missing one, and they don't line up,  urlLink but you get the idea . The mountain in the background is Mt Versovous (the one that didn't explode). The city next to it is Naples, and the town I am in is called Surento.  I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.

       My parents evening. Science (Moore) was ok, we had already figured out a revision thing after school. Art, she loves me. Heehee. History was good, he said that my coursework was very good and Q2 of womens suffrage was excellent. Then I moaned at him for not putting comments on it except 'reorganise'. LOL. Um, maths, my mum likes him, lol, she thinks he is really nice. He said that all I need to do is to get 4 more questions irght in the exam and I'll get a C!!!!! Yipee! English, fine fine, briliant, marvleous, excellent. Textiles, my machine work has improved considerably, everyhing is good, my paperwork is currently at a grade B so don't be surpise dif I end up getting a A or even A* apparently. Cool. Mr G is so lazy. Throughout the whole hour and bit we were there he spoke to 2 parents. The rest of the time he was just milling about or writing something. Tutt tutt. he shouldhave found something constructive to do.  Now Tom, I agree with your last paragraph in your previous blog. Very well said. Email them, complain. I might. Actually, about the firefighters. I agree with their strikes, I don't agree with how much they are asking but striking is giving them the attention and support they need. However, I do not agree with them going on strike now when we are about to go to war with Iraq, which I reckon will happen in about 10 days time if that. (They better leave korea alone btw, just look at what happened in Vietnam!!!!) They are tying up valuable troops. Even the Gerkuas or however you spell it are helping out and they are extremly valuable! These are the guys which is their sword is drawn they must produce blood with it or kill someone before it can be put back into its sheath believe it or not. Now I will continue to support the firefighters, my Dad used to be one and we tend to go to alot of the these firefighter things, shows etc.. but I really do think they should stop all this striking until tropps are available.  Have a nice day ya'll.

       Parents Evening, I didn't go as we where tight on times to get me there, but my mother gave me all the information I need. All the normal stuff like try not to stink of fags when you walk into the class room, and show some respect for the celling, use all four legs of the chair, all the normal. My favoruite quote from the evening; "he has a wicked sense of humor", my business studies teacher. She quite liked the idea that it's cheaper to use robots because they can work in the dark. (Bit of a nerdy business joke, so don't feel gulity if you don't get it.)  I know I haven't blogged for a little while, been very busy getting my head round completcated programming problems, which still have yet to be solved. Anybody with a logical mind please enquire within.  My favourite part of music lessons has started! Sorry, did I say favourite? I meant my most hated dreaded I-really-don't-want-to-do-this part of music. Composition. Sounds easy? You just write lots of notes down, play 'em and then you're done, but there are several probelems. First of all, I can't sight read very well so when I have to play them back to myself, I can't remember what I did. Secondly, I can't read or write bass cleff, I can barely manage trebble cleff! Thirdly, I can't compose! I don't know what to do and what ever I write sounds like a monkey wrote it. This is the kind of point where I think to my self I don't want to spend 1/4th of my 6th form eduction on the flipping subject. I enjoy listening to music, and to some extent I enjoy playing it, but I hate composing and I hate learning about it. The fact the clarient wasn't around in the Baroque period isn't important information to me. I really don't need to know that serialsim sounds like me playing the piano with my arse, and I really do not need to know that a Sitar is a guitar from India without frets! I don't care! I really do not care! I don't want to know this information, please, no more! That is the end! No more ever please!   urlLink How do you mend a broken heart?   The quaility of tabloids is really getting to me - it's crap. A Solicitor jailed for life for murdering her two baby sons is freed by court of appeal, Tony Blair today pledged that after dealing with Iraq, the UN would confront North Korea about its nuclear weapons programme, and The deputy prime minister John Prescott yesterday lost patience with the striking firefighters, announcing radical new laws which would enable ministers to seize control of the industry and impose a pay and reform package. So after all this in an amazing day of news, what does The Sun have for a headline and leading story? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook - the most read "news" paper (using "news" in the broadest possible manner) in the UK and all they care about is the realtionship between two people that I really don't care about. Yes, Norman Cook has made some pretty cool music, but I really think his private and work life should be seperated and respected.  Anyway, just got to say my bit about possible war and the monkey man himself.  urlLink This sums it all up  really, nothing much else to say other than what you can see in that cartoon.

       Lol. It is 8.06, and I literally have just  finished my tea, having just got home from a   very   amusing parent's evening! Highly amusing! Basically I'm awful and am gonna fail all my GCSEs is what the teachers said, and that I'm a rebel, trboule-maker, etc etc, the usual. But other than that, a VERY amusing chat with old Mr Westlife (his bame has been changed due to the fact he has called me Josephine twice this week), and then I couldn't stop laughing when I finally sat down to talk to Mrs HIcks, a) cos I knew what my mother was gonna say, b) it was quite funny seeing my mum smiling at Mrs Hicks in her 'Yeah, I'm smiling and acting pleasant but I think you are an absolute twat' way that she does, and c) my mum had said to me before hand that I could tell all my friends that she's sorry but she tried, and she couldn;'t get her hands all the way rouind Mrs Hick's neck!!! I just could hardly control myself, and Mrs HIcks probably wondered why I couldn't stop smiling at her! Anyway, hwo did eveyerone else go? Oh, and I  have found the route of my head pains- I need to stop grinding my teeth, cos it sends pains up my jaw, adn that is where it ius coming from! SO solution found! toodles peeps.

       Headache, you had a headache! I bet mine was 100000000000000 times worse than yours! Not only have I had it for a week now but i don't have an eyeappointment for another 2 weeks. An dto top that off when I was bending ove rto pick something up off teh floor in my room I whacked my head on the side of bed (has a this wooden thing around the edge) and now have a dent in it as well as a added to headache. Hmph. But I thought it was very nice to come in, put on the internet for a quick spin on my usual message boards and blogs to find that all my cool Ryan fans are really lovely and nice and don't argue with me for the sake of it. In fact they are all relaly suportive of each other, really helpful and are happy to help each other out. Then my cousin was on msn and it was cool talking to him as he is in North Carolina. His wife, dawn, has an interview tomorrow and if she gets the job they will be moving to....ready....CHICAGO! Wahoo! They are both really lucky!!! Brilliant. have to go and visit them then. :)

       No, I will not go to tan. But that site I put up was a American one and they should have a tan anyways. No I will not be waxing, I mean like dude, the pain!!

       Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!! May I just point out though, I willl be looking after my skin but I won't be going to the full extent of having a facial (way too expensive), I won't be having a pedicure (hwo much monye is this gonna cost?!), and I won't be waxing. Guys, if you think we all complain too much about pain, I dare you to try waxing your legs, and see how much pain you get into!! Not a funny thing, waxing. Ooh, and self tan- so not a good idea if youare accident prone (comme moi!)- probably won't be doing that either, unless it washes off if it goes horribly wrong! Anyway, I cnat be bothered really, cos I'm really pale anyway, and I generally can't be assed to go to all the ttrouble. I mean, my mum ends up with orange knees and orange hands and stuff, and at the beginning of May it is blatantly obviuos it is fake! Plus, I look ill (apparently) any way, so people will just have to accept me for what I am!! Nicki, Jackie, (and perhaps even Max??!!), are yoi going to be using fake tan? I know loadsa girls in our class have been on sun beds already, but there isn't a better way to fry your skin than to go on a sun bed, so that is a definite no-no. Anyway, I am just soooooooooooo excited about it all! I mean, for most of us, this is our first real chance to dress up in really posh clothes and act all posh and have a posh meal with our friends and ride in limos and scream adn dance all night wihtout our parents being there! Wooooooooooooohhhoooooooooo!!1 I am so excited!! You boys will have to time it so that we arrive at the same time as you  (near enough!), so we can all go in together as one   phat   gang!! OMG i am so excited!! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!! Yahhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey! Anyway, over-and-out from Jo-Jo!!!

       Well, I think pot noddles ae minging. basically. I agree with Jo, way to violent. It is making a mockery of Christianity. But yea Tom, that guy dancing is pretty amusing. Why is he killing them all anyway? Just to dance? How strange.  Anyway, I watched Ryan last night! Yaaaaay!  Debut on UK TV!!!!! Waaaaaaaahhhhhhoooooooo!!!!!! He died.                                                     That was relaly scary actually because you could hear him screaming and I was like nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Mind you I actually screamed at one point because the alien dude scared the bejeebus outta me. I'm so silly, I spend the whole program hiding behind my hands. LOL.

       IM BAAAAAAAAAAAACK. Well, this week has been interesting. Been making green sites with Tom, eating pot noodles as soon as I get up, putting myself to sleep with chocolate, flicking water at Jackie and proving to Mr Gallagher that chewing helps me to think. I have also seen a few incredible things like Nicki drinking from a David Brent mug, Andy and Jackie breaking a safety screen and people climbing D-block with hockey sticks (and me falling off and nearly breaking my back). I have just given my parents 20 to go and buy me the DVD Ratrace when they go shopping. So no prizes for guesssing what i'll be watching when I go to bed. I have a few pieces of homework, English, Science, Tech and um, somthing else. I'm not gonna write a long blog, as they get boring. Byedibye.

How amusing. Tonight Taken is on so I WILL be watching that. Not that anyone else will, apart from Andy probably. I'm off to town tomorrow with Jo C and Angela to spend my vouchers. Will it be fun? We'll have to wait and see. So, other than that. Chal for now.

       I went to the prom dress shop this moring and tried loadsa dresses on, it was soooooooooo fun! I'm now really excited about it all, but I have to wait till the end of February when she gets all her summer stock in b4 I buy anything. But anyway, I tried on some really pretty dresses and stuff, and it was quite a battle! There was this purple thing that was high at the front, and had criss cross straps, and I got totaly tied up in it, and the shop owner had to rescue me from it, it was quite embarrasing!! But anyway, that's me for you! It was this really nice little shop with posh clothes, no-one in there apart from the shop owner, and she picks out stuff that will suit  you, it's really cool! I thik that I'm going to go for a 2 piece, with a full (er) skirt and a boned-top (strapless) cos I tried this purple one on and it looked really good (even if i say so myself!), but it was too big, so it was being held in at the back! I'm going to go back when she has her new stock, and get one in a smaller size, and they do alterations and stuff there. BUT I am sooooooooo excited about it all, it was just such fun (apart from when I got stuck!!). Anyway, I'll stop rabbiting and go and do something useful!! Talk to ya later guys!

I don't really have the energy to blog right at this point in time, and I really don't have a lot to anyway.

       Maybe you s hold get your eyes tested nicki? Cos I had headaches a lot when I was younger, practiaclly every day, and it turned out i needed to have glassses cos my eyes strain too much. And anyway, its probably that you're stressed!  To be honest, I cacn't remeber nething about fame Academy (i onl watchewd a few), but i know i wanted Sinead to win, and I don't even remember who Ainsley was! Was he the black dude, or am I getting confuzzled with Ainsley Harriot? Um, dunno! oh, and I have just noticed it is Ainslie. But never mind, can't be assed to chgen it all!  I have watched very  little tv recently, only on the day i was off ill when I watched MTV and saw TATU's viedo (quite disturbing, not that i have nehting against lesbians, just its a bit disturbing). Anyway, tooooooooodles!!

       Pah. Yesterday was a bad day. I really could not be bothered to blog but I am blogging now so hopefully something I say may get othes to join in! I have a thumping headache btw. I have had all week. In fact its got me slightly worried. I mean, is it normal to have a headache everyday? Didn't Dr Greene on ER have lots of headaches before they figured out, that he, um, had a brain tumour? Crap.  But I mean like I wouldn't rule that out! Tumours are cancer yea? Well I think everyone in my family have died of some form of cancer. Pants. What a nice thought huh!  Well, on the TV just now they played all the fame acadmey videos. David, Sinead and Ainslie. Out of all three I must say that Ainslie has the best song and the video is quite nifty. It would be funny with Ainslie in the USa, they would not like him! I mean, he sometimes has on nail varnish but I think when performing he has just a hint of eye make up on. Which I don't mind. I think personally that if a guy has like eyeliner on it can make them look quite sexy.... or maybe that is my gothic side coming through. LOL.

       Well yoga has all different levels. From begininger to advanced. I guess when you start it you would feel silly becaause you aren't flexible but I guess the more you practise the easier you will find it to relax and once you relax the eaiser it wiwll be to become more flexible. And at the same time it improves your daily mood and way of dealing with things. :) Good way to chill out too. I'd like to try it actually although i know I said to Tom its silly but I have changed my mind. LOL.

       Go to that flexible club thingy, according to Laura it was good and she's gonna keep going, and there was only a few people there, so it was okay she said!  Other than that, I don't wanna sound rude jackie, but where would u put a trampoline? And where would u use it during the iwnter months? And when it rains (whihc is 2 outa eveyr 3 days in the UK!)

       Good morning.  Sorry, I just wanted to say that. My sister has this briliant radio which you can program as an alarm clock but te groovy thing is if you put a CD in it will wake you up with that CD and the song you choose!! Brilliant.

       He he he!!! WE have a limo bookedf, and it was affordable!! huuuuuuuuuuuuuge thanks to Natalie on that one! Yeah, i did my own enquiries tonight, i phoned numerous taxi services which had pretty crappy cars at high prices, and i phoned 7 limo companies, 4 of which were already fully booked for May 9th, the other 2 were veyr expensive, and one didn't answer the phone, Pah! But at least we r sorted with it!, and Jackie and NIcki, MY LIMO BUDDIES!!! How exciting! But yeah, I expect by May we will be too vbusy with revisio and stuff than to spend hours trapsing round lookming for dresses. I will get my dress asap, and do jewellery etc at a later date, i thinks! Ooooh, I'm so excited I cant think of nething else to sya, except tiiiiiiiiiiidles people!!

       Well the 'rents can be surpirsing. Maybe if you make a deal or something with them and say that you will try and save up even if yu only contribute a small amount. You never know! Good luck with it anyway :) I hear what you are saying about the prom thing. I mean pople need to book limos now because they will be gone by the time it comes around and I guess it same with the dresses, its best to get them early. I think everyone has just been in a leavers ball mood this week! I guess the phase will pass but it is someting nice to look forward to.

       ahhhhhh my parents ! As you may know i want a trampoline, now i have asked my parents for one as a joint christmas and birthday present. I have alos found one for 355 which is quite cheap for a trampoline, but all i get is No your not having one, No you dont need one and NO YOUR NOT HAVING ONE ! But the thing is i really want one and i know for a fact i would use it alot to practise on :( It is getting me really annoyed and frustrated and my birthday isnt until July ! lol. Anyway today was quite boring and i think i have really hurt my elbow cause when eva i hold something with that arm the elbow really hurts and is very painfull. But maybe im just a wimp ! And about the prom, its AGES away, why is everybody worring about it now? Im fed up of people going on aboutn it and who is going with who, we havent even been told where it is yet we have only heard rumours and stuff, we havent been told by the head of year or anything ! Knowing our luck it wont be where we thin kit is and it wont happen !lol bye

       Seeing as everyone has been talking about the ball for a while now, although not actually in the blog I thugh I would post up a few tips, for the girls anyway: (These are from my sister and from american prom sites I have been on)  After purchasing your dress, customise it with a elegant belt or maybe add decoration to teh dress itself depending on your sewing skills. That way, if someone turns up wearing the same dress as you at least yours will be slightly different, if not better.  Don't put on bright make up!!! Keep it simple and beautiful.  Earrings which dangle usually add to the elegance. According to  urlLink this  American prom site we should do the following:  4 Months Before Prom...  Make a checklist.  Find out how much money your parents will contribute.  Start saving money if necessary.  Pick out that special dress (put it on lay-away if necessary).   3 Months Before Prom...  Begin to maintain your hair and nails.  Pick out your accessories to coordinate with your dress.   6 Weeks Before Prom...  Purchase your Prom tickets.  Make an appointment to have your hair, nails, and makeup done.  If you are doing your own hair, start trying out different styles.  If you have not been asked for a date yet, check to see if the one you would like to go with has asked anyone, or ask a close friend before its too late. You can also go with a group of friends and have just as much fun and sometimes more.  Discuss your plans for Prom with your parents.   4 Weeks Before Prom...  Start wearing your Prom shoes around the house to break them in.  Pick up your Prom dress.  If you havent already done so, introduce your Prom date to your parents.   2 Weeks Before Prom...  Confirm all reservations and appointments you have made for the day and night of Prom.  Take care of last minute details: pantyhose, film, etc.   Prom Day  Pick up your dates boutonniere.  Go to your hair, nails, and makeup appointment(s).  Put some extra cash in your purse.

       I'm not leaving u out, and anyway, I didn't organise it, MIchelle asked me if Donna and I wanted to go in a limo with her, so we said yes. Anway, I did make a blog, but I could not for the ilfe of me work out how to format it, so i deleted it again! I was ognna try and teach myself HTML or whateva, but I couldn't! Never mind.

       Ah, now you see this is exactly what I mean when I say that I would get left, I already am being left out. People are organizing groups etc.. to go with in limos and stuff yet no one has asked me. I mean I happy to help out organize a little group but I don't want to be like THE one who does.  No, I don't think I will go to the ball after all.  Has anyone else made any other blogs no wthey have an account? If so what are they and I can link them to your name above instead of email or other sites.

       Well as I said anyway I am usually free as I don't have much of a social life. The dates I now I am out on are next weekend, March 15th and I am away at half term. That is the best I can do unless you want dates for half term? I leave on the Sunday come back on the Friday. Happy now?  And for anyone in the blog or anyone who reads the blog and thinks that the war on Iraq won't happen I will now quote George Best who I think has put this extremly well:  I wish all these people who are dithering about whether or not we should invade Iraq would stop wasting valuable oxygen. We  will  be going to war against Saddam Hussein, it's as simple as that. It's pretty obvious that the Americans have already made up their minds, and I'm glad they have the guts to do it.  And it goes on from there. And also please keep in mind that  you cannot prepare and prevent war at the same time .  [EDIT]I FOUND THE PICTURE! Its a picture of Ryan Merriman an dtis alien kid he tries to save for episode 4 of Taken, he gets killed, they both get killed, in a fire:  urlLink HERE .

       Oh dont worry, ignore that section of my last post.  I am trying to get an appropriate date for EVERYONE, so if I say, for example, 12th Feb, 3 out of 10 people may come, whilst if a small survey is carried out, then the maximum amount of people can come.

       What the hell are double line breaks? You don't need to post  like this. A simple new line is fine and much easier to read. It doesn't take up as much space either. And about skating, just tell me the date your going and I will tell if I can go or not. Its much easier that way. I don't usually go out anyway. I'm not socialble, really. I am out next weekend, hopefully I'll be in Croydon with Angela spending my vouchers. Or maybe I will buy a train ticket and go all the way down to lands End and back.

       Ack ack ack. I'm so bored. Just got back from the IWM which was okay, the bit I liked best was the 'secret war' exhibit about MI5 and MI6, and also the Post 1945 conflicts exhibit, mainly because although i think the wars were terrible tragedies, they don't really interest me all that much, I prefer modern stuff. So yeah, I had an okay day. Now I feel very car sick, and i had forgotten i had so much homeowkr, otherwise i would have done it yesterday and not left it till this evening!! Ooops. Oh well, off to finihs writing baout water boards. What fun.

       Can everybody give me dates that you CANNOT come ice skating. I will work out the most appropriate date for everyone then.   P.S: Includes weekends and inset days up til the half term in February.   Nicki, did you turn off double line breaks in this blog?

       Jackie, yea lets do that on msn. Max, fair enough but it would be handy if you could post brefly in the future to say 'I may not be on here for a few days' like Jo did earlier and that applies to everyone. Then we know where everyone is and I don't start thinking that this was a waste of time. No Tom I haven't seen LOTR and I don't want to. Oh and please don't write Ryan with " around it. He is a person not someone I have made up so don't talk about him as if he isn't real. And yea he is the Ryan I was talking about. I don't exactly know any others do I?

And you wanna get inside my head do ya ? I wouldnt want to, its full of crap and useless information that i have pickeed up in my childhood. lol. Anyway can someone else try and do the 2 questions i set please?

       *Sigh* You know I can't believe you asked that Tom. How many times have I told everyone who he is? About a bzillion. Thsi is just proof that people don't listen to me. Ryan Merriman is an upcoming actor, he has been atcing since he was a kid. He is known at all in the UK. I only know of him because when I went to Florida last year they were premiering a new film of his on zoog disney and I watched like 7 times. It was a brilliant film. So when I got home I looked him up on the ineternet and now I am a solid fan. Happy now or do I have to explain what zoog disney is as well? Armagedon has excellent graphics, it is not a silly movie. Just because something like that hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't etc.. so chil out and just watch it and admire Ben Affleck. Don't worry anyone, you don't have to watch Taken just because I asked people too or the fact that I have been reminding people since a week before the first episode. You are the ones who are missing out on a excellent program, by the makers of Band Of Brothers. No Jackie, you don't have to blog everyday. But it would be handy if people can try and blog at least every 2/3 days. Please.  If you could be one person for the day who would you be?  I'd like to be Ryan Merriman just to see what its like being him as he is filming a vew show at the moment. Or if I had to be a female it would be Jackie because I wouldlove to get inside her head.... :) Jo, yea you can pay 20.  I have another question for you all can you name one boys and one girls name for every letter of the alphabet?  A-amy B-belinda C-caroline D-dina E-erica F-felicity G-gemma H-holly I-isabel J-joan K-katie L-linda M-mary N-nicole O-olivia P-patrica Q- R-racheal S-shelly T-tina U- V-victoria W-wendy X- Y-yasmine Z-zaniah

       Good evening. He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl, can I make it any more obvious? We are in love, haven't you heard, how we rock each others world?  Armagedon really is pants, and a bit silly. I did not enjoy that movie, sorry. Girls, please explain, why are bras done up at the back, and not at the front? This evening, I went to a rather amsuing performance of Puss in Boots which Jo has been talking about, and it was very good - highly amusing. A few lines where wrong here and there, but it was all a good laugh. Nicki - who is Ryan Merriman?

       I'm here Nicki! Sorry I haven't been blogging much at all (and I can probably speak for Dave here too), but we have both been at panto every night this week till about 11pm, and by the time I have got home I have been knackered, and not had time to blog! So I apologise for me, and I am betting that David's reason is the same! I actually watched it last night (eveyr other night i have been changing scenery) , and it was hilarious! The Dame (who is always brilliant) messed up the end so much. They were singing this song about  'Where's the Cat'  to the tune of Robin Hood, and he came in at the worng time, so eveyrone was singing different things, and then he said " right, after 3" but ewhen he got to 3 they were in the wrong place in the music, so he had to say "4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9" really qyicly, and it was so funny! Also, they got the whoel audience stadnign up and sitting down in time to the music, and some bloke got totally out and stood up at totally thew wrong time on his own, and everyone laughed at him sooooooooooo much! Even the Dame started laughing, whcih he usually doesn't do (they're not supposed to laugh!). Other than that, the usual panto 'hitches' have happened (including the princess not turning up on cue, and then not appearing for a few minutes after that too!), but generally it is all a good laugh and everyone has a wail of a time! I have also made some new freinds, which is rather nice.  PANTO PARTY  next weekend, guys!" yay! Can't wait! Hah ha ha ha.  FREDDIE AND CHIRS. Ahem. Nicki, Are you sure you don't mind if I pay 20? I will pay monday, if that's okay. Yell if it isn't, or whateva!

       Max you are participating more than Dave but you kinda stopped cos of the argument you and Jackie were having. Anyway, its not friday anymore its Saturday. What does that mean for moi? Hmm, homework and cleaning my room which is disgustingly dirty and messy. Thatway I get tomorrow to 'relax' as Goff says. If you didn't get that when I asked her what she up too in the summer holidays it was 'nothing much, just relaxing' then I ask what are you going to do on holiday? 'Relax'. Bless. I am going to Croydon next weekend with Angela hopefully. I have vouchers to spend and hopefully I can get a computer game I have wanted for ages. I prefer games like the Sims where youa ct as god. LOL. Like Rolocoaster tycoon etc... I prefer them than fighting games. I reckon there are way too many of those games out, I mean how many can you possibly make! They are all the same! Your character justs goes around shoots and blows up people. Yea... that is why I like manger type games. You can make the Sims do so many things! You can design your own rolocoasters and see if people like them etc.. Much more mind stimulating I reckon. What things have I got to look forward too? Freddie Prinze Jr. and Chris Klein! Yay. And at half term I'm going on up to Norfolk to see my Auntie. I already know one day we are going up to this posh country club like we did before for a dinner. I love country clubs. they are so countrylike and posh. I already said that but they are. Honest.  Where is Jo nowadays? I mean I know she is helping her friend at the panto but now its the weekend! Shes gotta blog at some point, hasn't she? Hey guys, don't forget,  09:00PM - BBC2 - TAKEN . Watch it, please. Pleeeeeeease. Although its episode 4 I am waiting for when my love is in it. :)

       Good evening. How can this be? Why can this be? There is no other way, this can be the only way.   IT'S FRIDAY!  Come one people! Party! No? I know, it's misserable, it's January, it's cold, it's wet, it's annoying, and generaly, it's shit. There really isn't any other way of putting it.  Something to look forward to, I think my mum and I may be going to the lake district in the Easter holidays for some walking, yay!  Anyway, blog lots over the weekend, have a good one guys.

       I said to you as I emailed Dave, if you do not participate in the blog before Sunday you will be removed because there are other people I could invite to join who will blog. I had a crap day today and can't be bothered to moan about it right now.  I made someone happy today. That is something I am trying to do each day. I will be sending a video to a girl in Brazil. She can't get programs which Ryan Merriemn is in there so I am recording Taken for her so she can watch it. Shes now really happy. And these are some of the reasons why I wish to go to Antartica on a cruise:  urlLink 001   urlLink 002   urlLink 003   urlLink 004   urlLink 005   urlLink 006   urlLink 007

       Good evening. That was my brother lost in the rubble. That was my sister lost in the crush. That was our mothers, those were our children. That was our fathers, that was each of us.  Today was a normal day, for me. Not for others. Poor Jo wasn't a happy bunny this morning, so she went home, and I can't blame her really, the poor thing, being cold and tired isn't nice. I am sure she is nice and warm tucked up in bed fast asleep. Lisa hasn't had the best day as some of you know, but I won't go into detail on here. But, not to worry, because tomorrow is Friday, and also as Mrs Crouch reminded me, we are ever getting closer to February!  I really don't know what to say, so if I haven't got anything to say, I might as well just go.

       Ok, I thought it was clear but I obviously have to state it again. To anyonoe who is a friend of mine, I am a good listener. If people ever need to talk weather it be to moan or be angry, cry or just rant and rave I will listen. If they then want an opinion or suggestion on what to do about it I will try. If they want any help, I will try. I seem to have a knack of cheering people up as well which is always useful. And if the thing they rant about or want to get off their chest and tell me is a big secret, if they ask me to keep it a secret I will. i always have done, and I always will. So people, if you need someone to listen I AM HERE!!!! People forget that!!!!  Now that is said, my day? PSE was amusing with that homosexual video but when Miss Reid tol dus about that Major from the army coming in to talk to us I was like "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAA". Wooooo! Then 2 hours of English back on back, hmm, it was ok I guess. We had to do a mini-presentation on a poem which I found funy in my gorup. I mean Sean and Pat were in it! But I admit it, I do make judgements on labels etc.. no matter how much I tell people not to judge grungers just because of the musi cthey listen to and stuff because I judged Sean on the fact of who he hung aorund and he is a pretty nice guy. I was wrong, I admit it. Then we had lunch which was fantabulous wth our whole blockading the tech block in. LOL. Sooo funny! After lunch what did I have? Sciene! With Mr Gallagher, we made progress today. Now he knows my name...usually its simply 'Michelles friend' or 'Jackies friiend'. Heehee. Then German which is never that amusing anyway. So. Yup. There we go.

       Good evening, I been knocked down so many times, counted out 6, 7, 8, 9. Written off like some bad deal, if you're breating you know how it feels, call it karma, call it luck, I just don't give a  I never knew Virgin radio could be so dirty, extreamly dodgy stuff going on at this time, all kinds of things. Tune in after 10pm to 105.8 FM. It is the 16th of January, which means we are half way through the month, which means it's nearly February!  At this present moment in this thing we call "time" I am extreamly annoyed with myself, I really don't understand what is going on. Teachers keep telling me that I need some help, and then they decide that I need to work harder and that I don't really need any help, so I have no idea what to do, and it's rather annoying.  Jackie, tell all, I do, and look what happens. It is perfectly okay, we arn't exactly going to take the mick or anything, and so what if somebody sends an e-mail? I know people talk about me for different reasons (mainly bad things) but so long as I don't hear it, I don't mind. If I where you, I would get it all out of your system and really go for it. My problem is I never have anybody to talk to, there are so many things I want to say, but I really don't want to bore people with it, but I really want somebody just to listen. I am trying to convince myself of this as well, but here is a theory of mine; You are born, and then you die, and anything in the middle is a bonus. So I am going to live as long as possible, and if I muck it up, oh well, I am hardly going to be regretting it when I am dead because I won't be able to think.  Are we all in touch with the news? We are sending the biggest ship in our Navy to join the rest of the guys in the Gulf. The thing that is really annoying me, a question that Charles Kennedy raised, if the USA go to war, but the UN don't - will the UK? I personaly believe that if the UN say we should go to war, then we should "join in" and go along with it, otherwise we are going to be the misserable Brits who don't do anything. However, if the UN say "no" to war, and the USA go to war, we should definatly not go with them. Without UN backing, they are making an offensive move as Iraq haven't exactly attacked the USA.  But we don't need to talk about rubbish such as war? We need to be happy and smily, even if we are in tears. I need to dream, and I have just remembered, I haven't answered Nicki's question about honeymoons. For my location, like I said, I really want to be somewhere different and unique. Away from anything else, just completely me, my wife, and nothing else. Perhaps a deserted island? Something with beatuiful scenery, next to a beach, blue waters. For the perfect wife? I am not fussed about looks and colours, blue or brown eyes, dark or light hair, I don't mind, I have the same preferences as most people, big clear eyes that you can just stare into for hours on end. They have to have a good sense of humor, enough to make me laugh, however beable to be completly serious at other moments. She has to like active sports so we can go to interesting places walking and things. I really want to do some back-packing somewhere, like in India. Anyway, I could go on for ages...  Life is rather dull, January is always like this, nobody can really be bothered to do anything. Once we get into February and half-term, people will start to pick up again, and then it's home free 'till Easter, then that's it, pretty scary. I am curently sorting myself out for work after I have finished my GCSE (last one is on the 25th June I think) - what is everybody planning to do over the holidays? Remember, you have two months free.  Good night all.

       well what a fun day i had today ! 1. boys are assholes, you tell them something in confidence then a couple of weeks later you find out that half of their mates know and possibly half of the school as well. 2. Max your outta order i neva said you could tell anyone bout wot i said and that is why i didnt say anything to anyone else. 3.Im really pissed off today 4.Im not gonna tell anyone anything about how or feel or whats up with me from now on cause it will end up somewhere like an email inbox 5.Is life worth living? Is Ilife worth being born? Is it worth me being around? 6. No one cares about me and i wish i wasnt here

       Hmm. I can see you have put a lot of thought into it. However my thoery seems to work too. I mean, thepeople I care about in the way I think you mean don't care about me in return, someone don't even know who I am or have even heard of me! Now that can get you depressed...or you choose not to be. There are choices everywhere in your daily routine yea? Wheather to get up now or in five minutes, eat this or that, drink this or that, do this or not etc... So if someone doesn'r care for you in return you can either choose to be depressed or choose to be happy and just be glad they are your mate or something. See what I'm saying? And anwsering my own question from earlier: for my honeymoon I'd go on a cruise to the Antartica and my perfect husband? A bit of you-know-who mixed with a bit of you-know-who and then some of you-know-who. Perfect.

       Good evening. Don't point that hamster at me! lalalalalalalala dadadadadadad Today, in my little world, I discovered that being insane helps despression, or so says my camel, Steve. Life is shite. That is a fact, there is nothing I can do about it. No matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, things will always turn out for the worse. No matter how deap my bomb shelter is, or how many weeks worth of food we have. It doesn't really matter how many friends I have, and it doesn't really matter how much I talk to everybody. Nobody really cares about anything anymore, so why should I care about stuff others don't care about? Well I do, because I care. Now, caring about careing sounds a liitle odd, and you are all probably thinking "what is Tom smoking?" but no, I am have a strong theory. When you care about things, you think about them, which usualy makes you depressed. Think about that for a second, if you care you are thinking about it, which makes you depressed, unless you are one of the lucky ones where the person you care about cares about you. But other than that, you get depressed. Now, because you care, you keep thinking, so the best thing to do is to care about caring. Care for your care, keep caring about caring, and eventually you will care for nothing, only caring for others. Does that make sense? Perhaps I should draw a diagram.     Does that make some sort of sense? Simply, if you care about caring, you care for all, if you care for one, you only care for one.

       I'm here ma Chris friend!! I thought I had alread blogged todayt but i just have imagiuned it! Strange, eh? Anyway, i guess thaty's why I'm at home, cos I don't know what I'm doing today! Nah, I did take the day off not because I am ill, but I couldn't face over 2 hours with a certain tecaher, but I can't even remember her name now! Silly me. But anhway, thursday afternoon i will be happy and smiley JO (or as happy and smiley as I get, ha ha), and I will be until parents evening, when meine mutti is gonna turn the tables on that teacher whose name I can't remember, and i don't remember what she said to me yesterday either. It's all done and dusted.  So, basically I went back to bed having got up for breakfast, and slept in until about  10am, got up and wandered around for a bit. Had lunch at 12,  toastie cheese!!!  Um, then did a bit more of nothing, then watched neighbours, then put some very loud Eric Clapton on in my lounge, until my mum came home. She actually suprised me today, cos she thought I was actually ill, wheraas my dad got suss straight away (usually he doesn't pay any attention to my 'illnesses', but today he came to 'chat' cos he knew I wasn't ill). However, he wasn't cross or nething, I just said that I was entitled to take days off now and then, and he said as long as I am not gonna start doing it all the time, like a certain other member of my family. Ahem. So yeah., I oh crap. no. I was about to say I have just come back form my music lesson and am cooking my tea, when I suddenly remeber that I put my potato in the oven, and never took it out again. So I now have a very solid baked potato. Never mind. Charcoal, all the same. Um, and I am off to panto and 7.30, to help shift scenery around! I shall be doing that all thsi week, so I won't be on messengert after 7.30 every evening, nor will I be blogging or answering my e-mails. Just to warn you, in case you think I have all dissappeared.   not that ne one would notice, of course.    So, see you tomoorrow guys. I think it will be safe to put in an appearance tomoorow. As long as I am not going to be head hunted.

       Well boy did I have a bad day. Although you could say bad afternoon really. The whole us lot getting banned from the tech block has really peed me off, I mean, we don't exactly trash the place!!!!!!! Grrrrr. Where are we suposed to go now though huh? Our old corner? Thats a bit cold and wet. Ew. Fair enough if it were sunny but helooooooo this is england! We don't do sun! Much. Then bloody Chris in english flicking that candy off those candy necklasses thing. He was trying to hit Lee but got me instead an dit bloody well stung like mad. If I had looked up just at that moment it would've got me in the eye. Then when I anwsered Sir's questions and it took like ten minutes just for people to write it down. Geez. Now I am cream-crackered and wondering where our Jo has gone. Jo? Where you ma Freddie friend? And Jackie, I got ma Here On Earth DVD! Yay.

       Hello peeps, I am alive.  I do love this time of the evening. My father is sitting in the kitchen with some nuts and a beer, surfing the internet and writing e-mails. My brother is watching some strange programme from the 1980s on the Sci-Fi channel about this guy who can burn things with his hand (ouch?) and my mother is reading the newspaper and drinking her tea in bed - and this happens every single night. What do I do? Well I sit in here and type away on this thing all night before going to bed.  This is quite an interesting question you ask of us Nicki, our honeymoon? Well that is kind of asuming that we get married, and having a girl friend in the first place. So in a dream world lets say... First of all, the honeymoon. Well, as much as I loved Paris and other places like Prague, I would prefer to be somewhere unique for my honeymoon. I will explain all in the morning, it's too late. For my wife? Well let me make one thing quite straight, after previous experiences in that line of feild, she has to be more inteligent and an ape. I will explain the rest tomorrow as well.  Or I could be gay?

       Ollie has shoved a pen in her leg before...  Honeymoon, eh? Hmmm, I think a nice week or two in the Caribbian with you-know-who would be very nice. Need I say more?  Cinema. Im gonna have to think about that one. If its going to be organised so late that its gonna be during the half-term, I cant come because I will be in America.  P.S: Tom seems perfectly fine. I passed him on the way to geography today, and we both made a strange noise when we passed. Insane as usual. I think he is just doing his homework and coursework, which reminds me....english homework has to be in tomorrow! Aaaaa, look at the time! Byebye.

I mangaed to get his password and was then logging in so he turned my computer off, i did this twice and then it said that contact eh operating person cause his grace log ins had run out ! So he was pretty angry and then he shoved a pen into my back ! it well hurts now ! :( Well slightly later after our lesson i slapped him round the face cause he tried stabbing me again ! hehe well anyway a honeymoon, well no where cause im not ever gonna get married cause no one would eva fancy me or would want to go out with me

       Um, honeymoon would have to be somewhere quiet and romantic, maybe the middle east or somewhere (an Island of Thailand maybe?), as there are clear waters, nice sun, beautiful scenery, and you could just do nothing for 2 weeks or whateva! Would be bliss, I bet! And my perfect man would be tall, dark and handsome, with a wicked sense of humour, kind, inteligent and motivated!! COuldn't stand someone who just sits of hsi bum all day and never does anything! How about you, Nicki? AND answer it with no references to Ryan, Josh HArtnett or Chris Klein!!! Or anyone else famous, for that matter! Pure fiction here, deary!

       Hey Jackie, it's the mother of all stomach aches!!!!! Anyways, Tom didn't blog last night/this morning which is very unusual indeed. He better be at school today or I will get seriously worried. I hope it is simply that he hasn't had the time.  So onto maybe more fun topics, if you guys (and girls, heehee) could go anyway and I mean anywhere for your honeymoon where woul dyou go? Ooo, and who would your perfect husband/wife be?

       He hasn't really been on MSN all week, nor has he been on it since friday, both of which I find quite bizarre. Also, he usually blogs every day, and I don't think he has been on snooboo for a day or two. Hope he hasn't lost the will to live already, we're not supposed to do that until we actually get our GCSE results. No, I'm joking, where the hell is he? Hope everything's okay. I will come and see 8  mile if other peeps r going too!

       The blue writing is a link, for example  urlLink this blue writing here is a link to the bbc if u click on it . Does that answer one question? NAd btw, haven't a clue what safe mode is! On the other hadn, it looks like safe mode shows u the HTML of the page, so for example you can see the link written out properly, and each line break has the html for the line on it (minus the space, of course) . I think.

       S'all good. Freddie Prince Junior, I'm on my way to ya honey!!! Wooooooooooooohhhhhhhhoooooooooooooooooooo!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG. OKay, Sorry. Got tat outta ma system now I can calm down abit. Right right. I've just bought a load of books in a shop in caterham, cos I am gonna try and learn some Spanish before I go on holiday. I bought one of those CD-rom teaching type thingys this morning, but it doens' tell you the alphabet or the numbers or anything as basic as that, so I just went and got an everyday phrase book (typical touristy thing) and a voccab tool book. Whilst I was there I als found the last book in a series of superb books that I have read, and I bought a german phrase book for my trip to Austria with the music department! Das ist kaputt.Look at this:  "Eine Ruckfahrkarte erster Paris, bitte" how silly is that? Aking for a train ticket to a place in france, in german. Right. And don't say you can get a train from Germany to PAris, it is a bloody long way and would be a bit silly to do! Spiegeleier mit Zuckererbsen, bitte. Ha ha ha!!Die nummer funktioniert nicht. Ich habe verstopfung!! Ooooh!! I bet you canm guess that last one just by looking at the last word 'verstopfung! Achtung vor dem Hund!!! Mquah ha ha ha. OKay, I'm sorry, I'll shut up. It's just that, well, um, you see............. FREDDIE PRINCE Jnr!!!! and of course, for Nicki- CHRIS KLEIN!!!

       Chewing food is generally a good idea Nicki. I found that a while ago when I got a slice of salami rammed sideways down my throat. Not funny.  Anyway, the London thingy, I would love to go, just my mum won't book it cos she always ends up booking the tickets for things, and she has a lot to pay off on her credit card at the mo, oweing to Chrsitmas and our next holiday and all!

        Am I right in thinking this is a blog where you put down your feelings and stuff that has happened during the day?  Yes. That is right. The reason I don't want people slagging each other using the blog is because that is all that will happen. People will just sit here and diss people. If I let you and Max slag each other off now then you wouldn't be talking probably, ie: your previous post. You'd still be slagging each off. Fair enough if people don't get along but slagging each other off all the time isn't gonna help. I should know, just look at Lisa and I! Do you see where I'm coming from?  I am putting off my history coursework until tomorrow. Its all confused me, i don't feel we have done enough work on it. I mean for our Vietnam one we did like a terms worth of research etc.. So far we've had what, five/four lessons on it? Well. Tsktsk. And Jo, I relaly hope we can sort out that London thingy. I get hyper whenever i think about it! Heehee. And can we move the Imperial war Musuem trip to the next inset day? Ii am away at half term. Thats a point, what is everyone doing at half term? I'm off up to Norfolk to see my Auntie! Her house is so lovely. Actually, hers and Andy's are simelar! OMG, guess what I did thsi morning. I nearly choked to death [no, seriously I relaly nearly did!] on CORNFLAKES!!!!! That is outrageous! A few saturdays ago I nearly choked on a piece of rice while watching you've been framed and the evening before that I managed to get a chunk of chocolate stuck in my throat. I really should chew my food.

       Right, where did you get that info from Jo? If you got it from the front of that book, then you dont have to do the full course. (Dont take my word for that though). You should only be doing the full course if you have spoken to Mr.Parr about it. If not, complain.  Well, this will be my last blog of the week, as I will be going to America. See you folks!  P.S: IM GOING OUT WITH NIC.J!!! - I LOVE U!!!

       Then all of a sudden, a pellet goes flying through the animals head, sending him straight off the fence and into next doors pond. Looking across the garden, Andy is hiding there with his air rifle...       Wot a tosspot, killing foxes.  Fat Boy Slim is sad, all todays music is rubbish. Even my favourites like Puddle Of Mudd are total rubbish compared with Pink Floyd and other 80's rock.  Anyways, Ive got my job as a part time computer engineer! Yay! Ugh, the first task they set me was the one I hate the most. Replacing a hard drive and getting all the damn settings correct.

       I had a close encounter with one of the members of the fox family who live at the end of our garden. I think it was the daddy fox. Anywho, I was in the kitchen and he jumped onto the fence like our cats do as they jump from the drive to the patio. I mean this huge great big fox was on the fence! Amazing creature. He is in really good condition with a fluffy tail and a really nice orangy red coat. And he has huge ears!!! And lovely blue eyes. It was a bit scary when he looked dead at me though.

       That does explain it indeed. I haven't watched any of it yet. In fact I don't tend to watch particular channels, its the programs I'm after. Thinking about it now the channel I watch a lot is E4 with such great programs as ER, Friends, Smallville and many many more. Other than that I don't really have many other programs I watch other than The Royal. How fun. I am writing this at school by the way and Tom has a squeaky voice. LOLOLOLOLOL. That was funny eating lunch o 20 minutes ago as Darren and Jackie kept giving each other wedgies. Sooooooooooooo amusing.

       So Max, you don't like Johnny Vaughan? What about Dom Joly? Good stuff from Fat Boy Slim? Well the channel is designed for 20-30 year olds, so that could explain why you don't like it.

       Max watch your language please. Remeber, please only swear if you are extremly angry or peed off like Jackie earlier with his BS lessons. And I think it is up to Jackie what she does about it. I woudl suggest going to talk to Mr Johnston as he does actually do something about it but its her choice what she does. I just hope it works out for the better whatever happens and that what happens in her lessons don't affect her final GCSE grade.   "Halt, who goes there? BAAAAAAAAAA!" That is a quote from a very amusing true film based on the Apollo 11 mission, the film is called 'The Dish'. It is based in Austraila. We have uiton DVD and I think you guys should watch it someday. Put it this way: "Cliff! You just bulls***ed NASA!". Any film which lies to NASA has got to be funny. And anotehr film whcih is the total opposite of The Dish is Drive Me Crazy which I saw in 1999 with Angela. It is a good teen flick, which such lines as: "Well, I guess it's easy to be a bitch now that Brad's availabe again." "It's easy to be a bitch either way." and "Get drunk, have sex, be free... we're the class of '73!" and of course the great "Son are you stoned?" "Dad, wouldn't the correct question be, son are you ill?" along with ""I'm sorry Dave. I would have drove him home but I dunno how to drive a stick." "C'mon baby I'll teach you how....I got a stick right here!" "I meant a real car Eddie not a Matchbox!". HOW AMUSING!!!!!

       Max, you are not allowed to have an opinion of BBC THREE as you can't actually get that channel unless you got digital in the past few days. It is BBC Choice replacement, it has a couple of the programmes like Liquid News and 60 Seconds from BBC Choice, but also quite a few new programmes. It is 90% British made programming.  Also Max if we ski, we all ski together. Ski school is in the morning and afternoon, and if you want to you can ski after that for a little while. The slopes are 30 minute drive from the hotel. I have got 1 dodgy double audio jack and I am trying to buy another one.  Don't you ever get bored of watching The Office?  Jackie, nothing is going to happen unless you talk to somebody about it.

Basically in simple terms...........listen to fat ****, or listen to Bon Jovi :) dont forget The Office is on at about 10:30pm out there :) BBC AMERICA! Talking about the BBC, that new channel 3 is rubbish! And your opinion is........?  Tom, got any double audio jacks to plug into the player for America?

       OOOOOOOOOO lookie. First to blog for today. Well, well, well. Chilli, baby back baby back baby back ribs. And that kinda sums up the day. We repeated that phrase for most of it. LOL. I stayed at school until 5 doing some art courseowrk. But while the teach was working on it for me I cleaned up her side and now it is all nice and neat. Fantabalo. However I did learn today that the RE and German speaking exam clash. So according to Westy those who miss speaking appointments during the exam get to be put in isolation until we have done it so no one can tell us what is in it. Brilliant. I've never been in isolation before.

       I had Kazaa for a little while (1 day) it wasn't really the viruses that I was worried about, but there was just so many adverts and other rubbish it just wasn't worth it.  Guns 'n' Roses - Sweet Child of Mine - have you seen the video to that? Haha! It was made when filming the camera crew filming the video was popular, and they all look like they need the toilet, and they all do stupid little dances when they haven't got anything to do. It's on  urlLink KERRANG!  quite a lot at the moment, look out for it.  If any of you have ever wondered how mice find good sex partners,  urlLink this is how .  Other than that I don't really have a lot to say. Apart from Max, everytime you play You Give Love A Bad Name I will play the Popcorn Dance Remix. Now, You Give Love A Bad Name is a great song, don't get me wrong, and Bon Jovi rules, but I have heard it enough times to last me 'till the Summer. So, Max, this is your warning. You Give Love A Bad Name vs Popcorn Dance Remix. If any of you haven't heard Popcorn, or the remix, just ask for a CD and I will give it to you. It's cool the first time, but after that, it's just pants. I do have another song somewhere which I made with some dodgy music software that I will have to put onto CD for the trip.  Hey guys! Are we already for some  urlLink Spice ? "All five Spice Girls are reported to be meeting up on Monday for the first time in five years. Some pop insiders are even claiming that the once-legendary girl group will talk about reforming." Own up ladies, who was a Spice Girls fan in the '90s? I know I was! Don't be shy Max... you know those footsteps at the begining of Wannabe bring back good memories.

       Those 'Simple Minds'  tracks are my favourites! www.kazaa.com is where to go for it. I have not downloaded a single virus off there (not without intentionally looking for it!!!) If you havent already got a virus checker, you can download a good one off kazaa (like mine :), or I can copy mine to a cd for ya. (Norton Anti-Virus 2003). My fave guns'n'roses track is 'Dont Cry'. Kewl song. Heavy. I like almost everything 80's. Mostly the pop/rock part. New pop is just a loada bollox (capital fm, kiss, etc are rubbish. I listen to Virgin radio)

       I have to take life more as a joke? Omg. I am not even gonna reply to that.   "We say that the time of death cannot be foretold, but in saying this we assume that it is hidden in some obscure moment in the not too distant future, never realising that it has any connection with the day already begun, this very day that is so certain, and has every moment planned in advance." "CARTER YOU DICK!!!!" "Because of you I am still alive, Thank you." "Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay." "Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me." "Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked up God to take down this plane...A REALLY fucked up God." "Well FUCK DESTINY!!!!!!!!!!" "You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by it's tail. Every single move we make,from the mundane to the monumental...the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of...is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.

       Dont copy them from vinyl, get KaZaA and download em, you have broadband, so it shouldnt be a problem. Forget the illegalness :) of it because I have been doing it for yonks and the police are after FBI hackers, not general home users. Makes sense.  Hm, get some Nickelback on those CD's!!! As well as the Bryan Adams album "Reckless". Some specific Pink Floyd tracks perhaps, loadsa Bon Jovi as well.  Tom doesnt seem to know how much I will be plugging "You give love a bad name" on the ski trip......

       How do you know someone has seen Final Destination 2? They msn sign in name is: DEATH IS COMING. lol. Some of us went to see it earlier. Dave, Rich and Max got ID'ed and couldn't in! How rude! There was a bunch of year 9's in there because we saw Doe's bro. That is outrageous. Even Jackie got asked her age. Bless. Anywho, thsi is the review type of thing from the official site, if you haven't seen it and want to don't read, its a spolier, slightly:  For every beginning there is an end  Final Destination 2, the sequel to the hit 2000 supernatural thriller, finds Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) the only survivor of the crash of Flight 180 left alive. Locked away by her own choice in the perceived safety of a psychiatric hospital, Clear now lives in constant terror that Death is coming to claim her, as it did all her friends. Clear may be considered crazy, but she's not wrong. Death is moving toward suburban Route 23, heading south.  En route to a weekend getaway with her friends, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) watches helplessly as a logging truck careens out of control and loses its deadly payload, setting off a horrifying chain reaction that leaves twisted metal and dead bodies in its wake  including her own. A moment later, Kimberly finds herself still stuck in on-ramp traffic, with a line of commuters she saw die moments before trailing behind her. It was only a vision. But was it also a warning? Shocked into action, Kimberly blocks the cars from joining the traffic on Route 23 as a young police trooper (Michael Landes) arrives on the scene. The commuters begin to honk and complain until Kimberlys premonition comes powerfully and tragically to life before their eyes.  Death tears up the highway in a massive pile-up, with those left on the onramp narrowly escaping with their lives. But Kimberly knows its not over. Death won't be cheated so easily. Now this random group of strangers, who in Kimberlys vision were all meant to die in the freeway disaster, must join her in a thrilling race against time and their own paralyzing fear to do what all but one of the survivors of Flight 180 couldn't  stay alive.  New Line Cinema presents Final Destination 2, from the same producing team behind the original film, Warren Zide and Craig Perry (American Pie I-III, Cats and Dogs), with Justis Greene (Mission to Mars, Ill Be Home for Christmas) serving as Co-Producer. Noted second unit action director David R. Ellis (whose work has been seen in such films as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, The Perfect Storm and the upcoming Matrix Reloaded) directs from a screenplay written by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, based on the story by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress and Jeffrey Reddick. Returning from the first film are Ali Larter (Legally Blonde, American Outlaws) as Clear Rivers and Tony Todd (Candyman) as the mortician, Mr. Bludworth.

       Well recent posts have been saying something, then on a new paragraph changing subject and thats ok because it works. Its just rather annoying when people press enter as in enter for a new paragraph every time they start a new sentance!!  I am in such a good mood today. I'm not sure why. Lots of reasons I guess such as the fact that I am alive, my hair is curly today, its a nice morning, I'm going out with friends later, one week left until half term, my friends in other countries are so lovely, the pictures website has gone well and its all good as the americans would say. Talking of websites, Dave T has given me co-running the Year 11 Party Pics site, its just been re-done so go and check it out, tell me what you think. There are a few bugs we are sorting out  though.  urlLink Year 11 Party PIctures!!!

       I didnt think much of the new seats. Ok, so they were slightly more comfortable, but they didnt need to buy them.  I dont blog too often because there is nothing to blog about, I tend to say my own opinion on what someone has said (like i just did above). I got one valentine card, from Nic.J (can tell by the handwriting). I will blog once every two or three days, as there is no need to blog everyday. I just come on sometimes to look at recent posts.  The film will be good tomorrow, but I need to walk to Daves first (cant b assed to get the bus!) YAY! Then on Sunday i'm going bowling/croydon with Nic.J!!

I'mtrying, Jackie is trying so come on Tom, Jo and Max, blog!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't get any cards either not that I am bothered because I personally think v-day is a load of cobblers! Its just another excuse to feel special and for people to make money. So for people who don't get anything its worse. :( Anywho, I can't wait for tomorrow! I will probably hide behind someone during the film, I'm sure i'll get scared I always do when I see horror movie type of things! What did ya'll think of the new seats in assembly?

       It was a story a teacher from my juniors school use dto say that she was in a feild, lost her car keys, asked God for them, looked down and there they were. There is also the story of the onion but I won't go into that now. I don't know why people aren't blogging, Tom has already he is busy so fair enough but Jo hasn't said anything so I may have to email her a warning saying that she needs to blog soon. I went to the careers convention at school earlier. Very helpful it was!!! I was chatting away to the lady at the army desk for about 20 minutes!!!!!!!! Then I spoke to the RAF for a while.

And i dont commit myself to just oging with one person if i get another offer then i will go, i went with darren. Maybe you should set a date early then i wouldnt have gone to see that with darren i would of seen sometihng else. You gotta get in tehre early with me cause i go to the cinema all the time even if there is only me and darren.

       I'm suprised no one else has blogged today. Shocking. Max, that is short sighted I believe where you can see things up close but have trouble with things far away. Which is ok for driving I guess, not that any of us can drive officially yet.  Actually I'm really annoyed right now, I know that a number of you went to see 'Catch Me If You Can', I am led to believe Jackie and Jenny went. Thank you both of you, I guess people really don't listen to me, I'll repeat what I said to you both in January: 'I want to go see Catch Me If You Can, shall we go together in February' and you both said 'sure'.  Thank you, you have both just proved my point on how  no one listens to me .

        talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department.  Same for Mr.Hanson. Its like "oh, how is he doing in the I.T". Hehe.  Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  Probably Andy or Dave, Nic.J as well.  Ive forgotten what kinda sight ive got. I can see close up things easily, but looking far away looks really blurred.

        Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  That depends on what I do when I finish collage or uni. If I join the army then I would probably only keep in contact when I get leave etc... But other than that I like to think I'd keep in contact with Jenny, and Andy.   I had my opticians appointment today. very scary stuff. I am long sighted and have to get some glasses for doing school work etc.. They should arrive in roughly a week they said. The glasses are pretty nice. I think they make me look intelligent, ish. I am feeling relaly left out at the moment from our group. I know I am ill and that I couldn't go out even if someone asked me because I don't want to make my cold worse but no one even invites me anywhere. Although i must hand it to Jackie, as I talk to her now on msn she is inviting me to a film. I think.

       Well i didnt meet either of my targets from last year in fact i have got worse, and Tom at least you didtn have miss auld moaning at you saying how bad you did in ur RE test ( I got an F). Most of my grades from last year have gone down but i beleive that is cause last yea it was what we were attaingin in lessons not in bloddy exams when your under pressure ! I think these acedemic review days are a total waste of time espically for ur parents cause most of the time they just sit there and dont acually say anything unless they have a load of questions to ask. I got a phone call half way through my interview but me being good ignored it ! This years targets are to improve my science result to a B and to make a Structured revision plan and STICK to it ! lol Sod both of those targets ! Anyway enough said about bloodly school, i went to the cinema today to see catch me if you can, no offence nicki but it was quite boring although the storyline was good, it lacked action in my opinion but some films are like that so im not gonna complain. Question for you all : Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school? For me probably Darren buts thats cause we live so close to each other Anyway byebye

       Can't remember last years targets, and I can't remember this years targets. So good luck getting those sorted then. We spent 10 minutes talking about AS/2, how my GCSEs are doing, which subjects need what doing to them and then we spent the other 10 minutes talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department. I think I might just write "Jesus" 400 times on the exam and see what happens.

       I met, ready, both of mine! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!! Now I basically have to attend maths and IT revsion clubs along with textiles and art clubs AND other revison clubs including science. Argh! When will these clubs end? Especially as they haven't begun!   Anywho, right now I am multi-tasking!! I am writing a blog here, writing a blog for my austrailan type o one I am on, talking to 2 people on msn, watching last nights ER for the second time, drinking a chocolate milk shake (and may I say how marvelous it is) and wiating for a text. Ooo! I texted Paul (aka the Walrus) earlier saying 'aww bless, hes cute even when he is talking to his form tutor'. But I cunningly text him when he went in for his talk thing! Mwahaha. Bet he didn't have his phone with him. Mind you, you'll only understand that last line or so if you post on the snooboo.com forum.  I am trying my hardest to be in a cheery mood and it seems to be suceeding, even though I'm ill and I wil keep reminding everyone of that until I get the sympthay I want. LOL.

       I had met one of my targets from last year, which was to improve my maths. My other target was to get the science grade up. Didnt acheive that.  This years targets.... 1. To sustain the maths grade 2. To get grade up in science 3. To continually read books for English  *Sticks finger up for No.3*

       I have got no idea who the first person on my MSN Messenger list was. What did I do today? Cleaned cars - do I have to go into detail? Yes? Okay... We cleaned cars to raise money for our trip to Brazil in 2004. Sarah, Sophie, Law, Christable, Helen, Andy, Owen, Matt and myself. Neil didn't turn up, well he did at the begining for his meeting and then went home. We cleaned lots of cars and got very wet and cold, but it was good fun and it will be worth it in the end.  According to researchers, people bring good fortune on themselves by following four basic rules: maximising opportunity; acting on intuition; anticipating good fortune; and taking an optimistic long view of life.

        Who was the first ever person on your MSN contact list?  Dave T.  What a wonderful day I have had since this morning. Althugh I am still as ill as a foot and mouth ridden cow I have survived the day to London, thank God for Lockets!!! Ah dudes!!!!! It was soooo much fun! Me and Dave had a good laugh and our seats in the theatre were excellent, about 6 rows from the front. the show itself 'Contact' was excellent. The lights, stage, script, costumes, dance was brilliant!!! I have found a new found love for a) going to the theatre and b) swing dancing. Fabbo. Now I can't wait for 'This Is Our Youth' Jo, now I know more of what to expect at a theatre I am not as nervous so: FREDDIE AND CHRIS!!!! WAHOOOOOOOO!

       Tom, grow your hair. I would like to see what you look like "Sam McEvilly" (sp?) style. :)  At the moment, my only letdown is a huge ulcer on my tongue. I bit it in english the other day with a loud "crunch". I cant eat at all. I dont get hungry. Oh well, saves on the shopping bill at least.

       Tom, your hair. I think, from my fashiony designery point of view that you should go for something different. Perhaps get it highlighted and than the sides a bit shorter than the top then you can do a bit of a mohegan (sp?), a bit like Joe Armfeild, perhaps.   I had the worst night last night. I woke up at midnight because Dave text me damm him!!! 4am and 6am. I ended up getting up this morning at 8.30am. Darn it. If we were at school today I would not be going in I tells ya. I have a bloody sore throat, a stuffy erughy nose, stuffed ears (everything is muffled) and I am cream-crackered (knackered). Argh, I hate bing ill but I am going out today anyway. Lets hope I don't cough or anything too loudly in the theatre. LOL. Have a fun academic review day everyone.

       My day today: ok bearing in mind I am ill with a sore throat that is murder to me.  Anyone notice how I've been strangely happy though? I don't just spend my days depressed etc... Well I think I have figured why! I have been wearing this necklcae which is a happy face which I got free as a gift from the Hard Rock Hotel I stayed in. I'm always happy when I wear it. Check my hotel out  urlLink here !! Its was so awesome, the swimming pool has an underwater sound system and every few nights they have like a DJ at the pool or a dive-in movie/concert. They showed Harry Potter when I was there. Excellent. Love it!!!

            urlLink      This is Big Brother. The application process for Big Brother 4 is now closed. Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare your selfs for another summer of complete and utter rubbish.  I'm sorry, but the first time was quite interesting. It was new, it was a bit of a laugh, it was okay - but this is getting silly. Please, not another summer of strange freaks in a house trying to prove them selves to be somebody they are not. It ain't good TV anymore. What is good TV? Well the new channel BBC Three is sounding quite a good idea. Fat Boy Slim is having his own programme, should be very good. BBC Three's indents are made up of this strange creature called Blob (the guy on the left) - it's a bit odd, but if you want to watch the indents, there are  urlLink available here . Clip 3 is a bit dareing, and the BBC will probably get lots of complaints, but never mind. Anyway, if you are interested, BBC Three launches on Sunday 7th February 2003 at 7pm.  Unfortunatly nothing exciting is happening to my life, it just seems to be everybody else with the "fun" (as they call it). So I really haven't got anything to say, I might as well live in a ditch. However, we do have something to keep us going...   four day weekend!   but I am washing cars for money to go to Brazil! So it's all good really.  Jo, you asked me about the different sized text? I have made you all a little guide to explain size etc  urlLink here . Any other questions, just ask!  G'night peeps!

I love that program, the newer ones are better I think. Although the old ones are funny in the sense that the Pete characters says 'mate' an awful lot. Perhaps he is related to Mr Dicks? Talking of Mr Dicks him and Westy have taken all teh text bokos leaving Mr Bradwell or whatever his name is 2. LOL. How amusing.

Lunch was funny' etc... then it would be so boring! And I mean BORING. Whereas at least with this we can also have a good debate and not just a silly argument.

       I know you hit me deliberatly around the head, that is why I said  'a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head' . Yea I said stuff but that is because of your attitude to this. After a few days I'm sure I'll stop, I always do unless your Lisa. Fair enough if you have been brought up like that but just because thats how your parents act doesn't mean you should too. You know you are your own person, not just some clone of others.

       Ah, now Nic is a person I love, you are correct in assuming I will be very upset if something like that was to happen. I did not know the people in that shuttle, so ok, my deepest sympathy goes out to their families. The space program can go to hell, what is the point in bringing little insects like mice into space?  I have been brought up not to care about much, i.e: I have had to sleep in a broken bed all my life apart from when I was in a cot or whatever it is called. I am told to shut up and put up about it. I have to live with that sort of attitude, so I personally grow up with it.  In case you are wondering, I hit you deliberatly around the head because you had constantly been talking about me in science and playing some card game and saying "Max is the arsehole", not forgetting you threw that thing that Andy had  twice  at me.

       Actually, you will only be removed for the following reasons:   If you use a large amount of swearing for no apparent reason   You are quite blantently aggravating people, on purpose   You don't post at all over a period of 2 - 3 weeks even after I have emiled of reminded you to blog  Just because I disagree with what you said doens't mean I'll chuck you off. I'd like to hear what other people think on it. By the way Max, I didn't mean to kick you earlier it was a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head. So what would I like your views on? Well, I found out late about Columbia and when I was talking to Max about it all he said was 'o well shit happens'. I find that very disrespectful and rude. Its isn't everyday a space shuttle which was on a very important mission is destroyed and its crew killed. I could understand if it were a car accident because they do happen everyday. Put it this way Max, (and to Nic or anyone else I don't mean to upste you or be rude) if someone you cared about, ie Nic, was killed weather it be a car accident or not you would be extremly upset and greviving and would not want people tos hurg and go 'o wel;l, shit happens'. Thats like saying it doesn't matter. Ist like their deaths don't matter, or the crash itself doesn't matter. What about their families? 4 of them were married, what about their children? They have to grow up without a dad and that is something extremly hard to do. Then theres the space program itself, that will be put on hold now for a long long time. There are people in space now from Russia. The space station, also a very important project, what will happen to that? This has an on going affect, its isn't just 'shit happens'.  Argh, why don't you guys think before you say things?  -edit- Excuse me Jo? How can you come on here saying how all we talk about is depressing stuff when throughtout today and past week or so whenever I talk to you your always depressed! And you never give me a reason either!  "You can't go around being all depressed all the time, life goes on"  ha, thats a bit rich isn't it. I thought we were good frineds, so how come you never talk to me.

        I would just like to point out Max that BBC News is paid for by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   Not quite. I didnt say anything about TV, I was refferring to newspapers.

       I would just like to point out Max that BBC News  is paid for  by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   I have newspapers starting from the year 2000 till present day of all important events, local and national - such as Prince Charles riding the tram!  Silence...   Found this from an amusing article called 'How to... study' in yesterdays Gurdian. "Studying is copying things from books, and revising and highlighting the nouns what you have copied. But remember, your teacher probably wrote the book you're copying from, though when you've reduced his life's work to one noun, he might not recognise it."  urlLink How to... study   What did I do today? Well this morning myself and Andy went skiing! But just before that we played with his ferrets, they are soooo smelly! But quite cute. The skiing was very good, soon as Andy worked out how to turn he was fine. Then this evening my family and I went to my grandparents for a meal and to talk about stuff such as house prices. Did you know that a 3 bedroom house in the year 1976 was 17,000? How much did your last car cost? Crazyness.  Anyway, my view on war if it has been said already there is no need to say it again. But seeing has everything has been said I want to say, I bid you good night and sweet dreams - I'm going to have a bath.

       Yes agree with what you are saying nicki but do you not think that they go slighly over board, I know septer the 11th was a very tragic day but do we still need to read about it in the paapers for the next month? I think not all that does is put us in bad moods and makes us afraid of going out, just think darren was in america when that happened ! Here you go nicki it is back again for ya !

       Now isn't this good, we are having a constructive debate nota argumentwhere peopel insult each other while swearing. How nice this is.  Perhaps they do go overboard but things like the recent Columbia crash will affect many things, like September 11th. War on Iraq will constantly be in the papers like it is now I guess but that will have a lasting effect. Some people like myself, like to read everything that happened ie: minute by minute, others don't but they have enough there for everyone I think. Plus your point about darren proves how its godo to know what is going on. Say your sister was in New York when that happened you'd want to know, even if you knew she was ok, what was happening and what was going on. So they are goo din that sense but yes, they do have it on the front page longer than people want to see it. I see your point.   -edit- Jackie just deleted her last post which this was replied to

       I agree Jackie, they do print more 'amusing' stories, or a wider range anyhow. I read the Daily Express. But when something like September 11th or the Columbia tradgey occurs I tend to read the Daily Express, Telegraph etc.. I also keep the papers for that day. I have about a bzillion from September 11th, ranging from the actual day to about a week after, including an OK! magazine. I also figured that when I'm like 70 or someting (if I live that long) my kids / grandkids may be taught about it and I can say 'weel lookie here kiddo'.

       I couldnt care less if "shit happens" was written all over my gravestone because I will be dead and won't know anything about it. The 7 crew members were going in NASA's oldest shuttle and knew their lives were at risk. People die all over the world every day, so what so different about 7 extra people? That is my opinion, I will say nothing more.  I dont read newspapers, whats the point in paying when you have  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/news ?

       hello, sorry ihavent blogged lately, but im glad you all noticed ! To be honest with you all i reakon the newspapers just print the stroies to get attention, they arnt in it to deliver us news they are in it for money-- How discracefull is that? And to be honest why do they have to print about 12 pages all about how it crashed, why it crashed, when it crashed, who was in it, why they were in it, how their families are coping, pictures of it ( how rude is that) and then not fogeting they then write most of it all over again the next day. I used to read the newspaper every day with out fail but now i tend to read it if there is something good on the front page and then i only read half of the paper cause they write a load of shit in it ! What is the world coming too? Any way sorry bout my rant there just letting off a litlle steam, and id like to say im going naked to the ball ! bye

       I'm sure Jo is fine, didn't she go to see Chicago yesterday with Donna? A highly amusing picture of Andy.  I really can't get over how gay the Daily Star is. Every newspaper I have lokoed at today has the space shuttle on the front weather it be the picture of it breaking up or the crew but its there, theres a story, they are remembering. What does the daily star have? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook. Bloody outrageous and very respectaful. I may write and complian or email the bbc with my view.

Today I went shopping! I bought this really massssive scarf which is nearly as tall as me! I bought some underwear, some cosmetics, and had a good smooch around all my favourite shops - didn't buy an aurful lot because I don't have a lot of money at the moment, especily with a holiday coming up soon.  I have been talking to Andy over MSN for the past few minutes, so here is a screenshot of Andy, wearing a pair of breasts:

       Space Shuttle Columbia destroyed, crew of 7 dead. Returning from a 16 day mission. Debris scattrered over Texas.  A terrible tragedy for America and the space program and what does Max say? Shit happens. In that case if you ever die in a car accident or any other way what will be said on you gravestone? Shit happens. That is so inconsiderate. So fucking rude.

       Well I haven't done much at all today. I have been discussing purchasing a domain which I will be doing so once our exams are over. I have been trying to find, which I now have, a padded envelope to send a video to Brazil. I have annoyed someone in America. Oops. I have also, shockingly, tided up my room! dear god what is the world coming to when I tidy my room! Now I must make a start on my IT coursework after I change my 4 calendars over. Lets see, February: Josh Hartnett, Tom Welling, A1, Buffy. WAHOO! Don't forget Taken, 9.00pm, BBC2, Ryan's episode tonight.

       At least you got told the clocks went forward! I didn't know. Andy picking me up to go clay peigon shooting at 9:30am. Right, so if I get up at 8am, that gives me plently of time to eat, have a shower and perhaps make a start on some homework. Did that work? No! I woke up at 9am (8am GMT to what my alarm was set) and I had half an hour to do everything in. Crazyness. Anyway, the clay peigon shooting was brilliant! I did actually shot a fair few, but that shotgun does kickback quite a bit. Spent the rest of my day doing maths coursework, oh how exciting.

       It is a pretty cool room, one of the best teachers and it's the biggest room. I have cleaned up some of my New York photos that don't look crap because I used a film my brother hadn't re-wowned properley so I used it. You will see white things and parts of buldings and coaches in the background of the photos, and I have taken out the horrible bits.  urlLink Here they are.  All rubbish, but I tried.

I am going outside to have a look...  ..I think it's Croydon Council, but really, why now? There are other through paths, you really don't need to be digging up the road at this stupid hour.

       I can (sort of) do line vectors, but that's as far as I can go. You're right, you did say "Donna and I" I miss read, being worn out by my two cousins who are staying with us this weekend. Yesterday we went to Godstone farm, today we went to the park! Ah the joys... That restruant does sound like a good idea - what kind of food is it?

       Hang on a minute Jo - Donna had a massive pudding? Donna? Only the photos will show the truth! The dinner was good, and yes I was staring into middle distance rather a lot.  For the ball, I am still deciding between a suit or a dinner jacket - can't decide, what do you think?

       The meal woz brilliant, the food woz really nice and it definatly filled you up ! Only  thing i was a annoyed about is the bit where Angela's boyfriends Simon walked out cause Darren woz flirting with Angela ! Also we were stuck down the slightly boringer end of the table so we couldnt get in to the convosation as much... After the meal woz good as well cause we managed to get into the Bowling and arcade bit, we had a few goes on the arcade then most people left. Me and Darren couldnt leave until half 11 because that was when the Taxi was booked for, so we wne tinto the bar and ordered some alcoholic drinks ! Somehow we managed to get served even though not one of us looked over 18 !! It was just me, darre, emma, helen, penny left by this time ! We all look the youngest so im really surprised we got served. Unfortuantly it didnt last for long and a bouncer came over and told us to get out of the bar and to leave our drinks becasue we couldnt prove we were over 18 ! We didnt mind though cause we were oging to leave in bout 5 minutes anyway. I think that is the best night out i have ever had, but i suppose thats cause i dont go out very often ! Lol, what a sad life i lead !  Anyway today woz fun !!! NOT i went to croydon with Goff and Darren, David was meant to come but in the end he didnt so it was a bit of a nightmare ! Goff was looking for shoes for the ball which she found but only after 4 hours and it was in a shop we visitied when we first got into Croydon ! Arghhhh. She was quite funny at times though, like when we were going to the bus stop we saw out bus was at the stop bso me and darren started to run to catch it, but Goff said she couldnt run so i said well walk quickly then so she speeded up by  about 2mm per second! Luckily we got the bus cause there were lots of people geting on it so it didnt pull away. What was more funny was when we were actually on the bus it started to move before Goff had sat down and she neally fell over !!!!!!!! I had to grab her hand and pull her to a seat. I nearly wet myself laughing ! And in the entire shopping trip i didnt buy one thing ! Anyway thats enogugh of me for one day so bye bye see ya Monday

We ahev problems here we need to sort out, we had a bit of a domestic last night. Lots of shouting. My dad no has to work a 12 hour shift instead of he usual 7 hour. Fair enough with the war and all, they need heightened security. I hope this weekend turns out for the best.  Please spare some throughts for the 12 who died in the copter crash and the one american marine who was KIA today and their famillies.

And do I need to stockpile food, water, or anything else?   Anywho... Thomas is very busy at the moment because he is becoming increasingly paronoid about himself and all this work he has to do.

       Hey-ho. Well, hopefully they can avoid using weapons of mass destruction, they barely scraped by with the Cuban Missiles Crisis. Its out of our hands, just hope it gets sorted quickly. And I'm not that worried about war anymore. Well I am, I'm worried for all those soliders out there who could get killed at any moment. You see I figure why worry about it if we can't do anything directly? Its gonna happen, just hope its over with asap. I wouldn't worry too much anyway, the Iraq army would fold under the British and American. I probbaly sound quite 'oh I don;t care' but I do, I do care alot about this situation but there isn't anything I can do!!!!!! I wnat to but there isn't anything.   How are you all?  Very well thanks!  Have you all got your stuff for the ball?  I have my dress but that's it.  And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party?  I'm not going but I hope ya'll have a great time!  And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point ! But maybe thats just me being lazy ! LOL   I totally agree!!!!!!!!!

       Is it just me or are you feeling slightly worried about war? If BUSH is going on about how they have waepons of mass destruction, doesnt that mean if we attack him he will use them? Just think of hiroshima, all tehm people dies, we are close to london and that is gonna be the main place for an attack? They would get the royals and all the cabinit as well ! Im slightly afraid that if this war goes ahead then we are gonna alll die and painfully as well ! Not to make you all feel bad but im just slightly worried ! LOL Well anywho we better live our lives to the full now cause we mite not be aound for much longer With Love jackie ! x x x x x x Anywho Back to more exciting matters ? How are you all? Have you all got your stuff for the ball ? And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party? I sure am cause its gonna be fun dont ya think ? And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point !

       Finaly! I'm on a computer, wow. Spent most of my evening staring at my music coursework hopeing that a melody will pop out from somewhere and write its self onto a page - no such luck so far.  What a day hey? Robin Cook (British Cabinet minister and Leader of the House of Commons) resigns, UN staff at the Kuwait-Iraq border move out along with all UN staff inside Iraq. Russia and Portugal tell their staff to leave Iraq while diplomatic staff from other countries begin to leave the country. George W. Bush is going to issue a speach tonight where he will make a final ultimatum to Saddam. We are going to war. Now I ain't gonna go on about this for ages, but I am starting to be pro-war. If we stop now, he's just going to come after us in future years and probably cause a lot of damage. The people in Iraq are in great trouble and need help, what can we do? Sit around and wait to get blown up or gased, or actually stop him before he gets rid of us. Just the ice-cream talking probably, but still.  Now this is pathetic,  urlLink Dogbreath ad is withdrawn , "A TV advertisement featuring a man "vomiting" up a live dog has been pulled after record complaints from viewers ... chewing gum manufacturer Wrigley's decided to withdraw the advertisement, for its X-cite brand of gum, after watchdog Independent Television Commission (ITC) received more than 700 complaints ... 'Parents have been complaining that their children are scared by it, and some of the adults have said they were actually sick themselves after watching it'." I'm sorry, but that is pathetic, that advert is not disgusting or horrible, you barely even see anything at all apart from a dog jumping out of somebodies mouth. It isn't sick, and it's a fairly amusing advert. It didn't make me laugh, but at least it isn't as dull as Persil or a debt helper.  Anyway, this  urlLink Steve Bell cartoon  sort of sums up todays events to a certain extent. G'night.

       Jo you little f**k. What the f**k have you been f**king smoking or you just f**king high on f**king fear? You f**k.  Yes, sorry, problems with blogger this morning. All sorted now. Yes, yesterday. Ah, yesterday. Fond memories. An educated hour or so wandering around art galleries, taking in some culture. Especially that of the Tudors whose paintings all look the same. Then a five minute brisk walk through a rather pathetic peace protest. Well, they did try. And we were attacked by a few pigeons and we all now what pigeons mean. Then a wonderfull 2 and half hours of Freddie and Chris. Feel free to take Freddie Jo, Chris is mine. Hehe. I think his hair suited his character. Maybe it will be cut now they have finished the play. Or maybe his next film requires long hair. Who knows. Who knows why Mary owned a little lamb. Who knows.

       Bad moment today. We assembled the PC, and discovered we had incompatible memory. I knew this all along, but my dad didnt want to change the memory for the compatible modules. So he's suffering now. Tomorrow, my dad is going to go all the way to London, because he ignored me, and just to buy a floppy drive and replace the memory modules. (We didnt want a floppy drive at first because we have no use for it, but I need it for schoolwork).

       I got my business studies test results as well, mine being:  Unit A - How Businesses Operate - 23/35 (Merit)  Unit B - How Businesses Develop - 20/35 (Pass) ONLY ONE OFF A BLOODY MERIT! GRRR  Unit C - Business Finance - 25/35 (Merit)  So that wasnt too bad at all, considering I didnt revise for any of them. (Shhh, dont tell Dilley!)  My coursework for that is currently averaging out now to a BB grade. I could get an A*A grade if I put max effort in. I have six weeks :)    SHIT!!!!! AAAAAAAAA Just remembered, Gallaghers homework! bugger it. quarter to ten, erm, ok, plan of action.....have pot noodle, have shower, then do the work in bed. That sounds about right.

       I usualy watch MTV Dance, and quite often there is something interesting on MTV2, MTV Base just sucks and gives me a headache. But MTV for Jackass, a always.  I haven't blogged for ages, don't know why.  My business studies results are as follows... Unit 1 = 29/35 (distinction) Unit 2 = 35/35 (distinction) Unit 3 = 29/35 (distinction) Distinction is the equiverlent to a A/A*, all I have to do now is get me coursework up to distinction level and I will have my A/A*!  Unfortunatly my photos of New York didn't go very well because the film I used was the film my brother used when he went to Germany and he didn't rewind it properley. So I only managed to get 2/25 photos.  urlLink Times Square  and  urlLink a building a couple of blocks away from Times Square . I did have another film which is being processed now, but I can't remember what's on it, I think a photo of the Statue of Liberty's bum (that's all we could see the weather was so bad) and a park.  I have had my teeth operation explained to me. I am quite impressed with my teeth, I have a severe class three case on the top and bottom of the mouth, what ever the means, but it don't sound pretty does it? The whole process takes 2 years from start to finish. Braces for 1 year to align my teeth up straight, and then 2 days in hospital after an operation to move my jaw into the correct place, then back to braces for 6 months to finish is off, then to retainers for however long is needed (normaly 2-3 months). So that sounds like fun, I won't be able to speak for two days! How will I ever cope? Which brings me nicely onto my next point...  ...tomorrow Christy is doing a Sponsered Silence! So I am going to walk up to her and ask her a few questions which she can only respond to by saying "yes" or nothing at all. Mwhahahahhah power.

       HA! I have proof now taht shcool really is bad for your health. I have become slightly ill and the reason why? Instead of going home at the normal 3.35 I don't leave school until 5! Why? Because I stay for art, science, german, textiles and IT. Now i'm all run down and erugh :( And now the Inspectar Calls trip has been canceled I'm very annoyed. Well, at least we get our money back.  So what have I got to look forward to atm? My great friends on message boards I talk to who are teh most lovely people in the world! I am looking forward to Saturday Jo! Woooooooo! (BTW, if you can get dropped at my house at 10.15am or so then my dad can run us both straight up the train station). And I am emailing some people who have seen it so that we may have a chance of meeting Chris and Freddie! Wooooooooo!  What programs do you watch on MTV if you get it? I watch Jackass and MTV Cribbs. Love Cribbs. I was watching O-town!!!!!!!!!! really nice house!

       Curently i am also happy because i got my business studies results back. They are : Unit 1 = 27 (merit) Unit 2 = 29 (distinction) Unit 3 = 25 (merit) I am pretty  happy with that but that unit 1 was a bit annoying because i was 1 mark away from getting a distintion !  Overall i think i will get a B maybe if i try harder i can geet an A ! Yippee. Neway thats all i wanted to say LOL Toodles-  Jackie

I found all my business coursework hiding deep in the depths of the schools network. Yayyyy! My deadline for Geogrpahy coursework........Friday. Oh bugger. My deadline for tech.........................31st March. I think I can make that one. My deadline for I.T...........................Easter. Quite a lot of it to do, but its easy. Nic.J is almost over her flu, now shes just waiting for Pete to get back home so Nic and I can see each other again. YAY! The construction of our brand new PC is almost complete. All we need is a hard drive which should arrive in about 3 or 4 days. Byebye.

       I've decided to re-change my A-level options. Originally, in a perfect world, I wanted to do I.T, Electronics and AVCE Business. But no.... Vinton said I cant do electronics because I am not taking physics. Crap. So instead I chose to do Media Studies instead of Electronics. Now, as I have seen the application form again, I just want to do I.T and AVCE Business. Media Studies will probably not play any part in my life, so there is no point in doing it as it will be in theory 25% more extra work for sod all in return. P.S: I managed to recover 50 pages of Business coursework out of the 75. The other "lost" 25 pages I found in draft form on the schools network. Not bad. I'm getting happier.....slowly.

       Ugh, this week has been so crap. I wont go into detail because there is so much rubbish that I will type. The main reasons are: Nic.J is ill with the flu :( I hope she gets better soon! Tonsa coursework Plus losing around 75 pages of business studies coursework is icing on the cake. I sure damn hope my beloved MS-DOS program can restore the floppy disk, its done 100 times better than all 6 of my Windows data recovery programs! Oh well.

       I was talking to Blackburn the other day and he asked me what changed, why we are going home, and I said nothing. That's not true ya know, I think every things changed. I know I changed. Ya know a friend of mine asked me before I got here, when we were all shipping out, he asked me why are you going to fight somebody else's war? What, do ya all think your all heroes? I didn't know what to say at the time, but if he asked me again I'd say no. I'd say there's no way in hell. Nobody asks to be a hero, just sometimes turn out that way. It's not that i like em or i don't like em- I respect them. Look, these people have no jobs, no food, no education, and no future. i just figure that, ya know, I mean we have two things we can do. We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN. Right? Sometimes people ask me why I do it, they say what are you some sort of a war junky? I dont answer them cuz they will never understand. understand that its just for the man fight next to you. Only the dead live to see the end of the war.

       Any pictures are great guys, we can slot them into the categories or into Misc. We will put them on the site and see how they go, if people really don't like them we will have to take them off but we'll see how it goes. Thanks :)  My weekends plans are simply doing homework and recooperating from Thursday. London is really tiring. Today I did lots of art and watched Black Hawk Down. YES! JOSH HARTNETT IS IN A WAR FILM AND ACTUALLY LIVES FOR ONCE!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!! Yea, so that made me happy but now I am all very patriotic towards the USA. BHD is a true story film and they're motto type o thing: 'Leave no man behind'. Even if they guys were dead they defended them and kept the bodies safe until they could get them out of there. Now that, is honour.

       I took a couple in New York, and I didn't bring my little camera becaus I knew everybody else would bring something - which they did.  urlLink My diary of what happened on our trip, slightly edited.  The weather in NY wasn't good, so the photos I took probably won't come out too well, but I tried. I was going to make more recordings, but I only made one for some reason.  urlLink This is the group on the bus just after we landed.

       Tom, Max, please blog. You have been back for a while now and you have both been online so please find teh time to blog. Don't make me send out the warnings!!!!!!  I had an ok day today although there is one thing which is annoying me. And that is the fact that everyone keeps slagging off Mr G. Ok so he may not conduct the best lessons with his sarcastic comments and stuff but he is a good teacher and if it were between him or Mr M, Mr G would probably get us a better grade in the exam.

       Hello? Anyone out there?  Well I did not have any clue what was going on in our science lesson. To me it was a board of waffle and I sat there feeling like a total plum. So in the case of me being a plum, here is the song from Joey in frineds: "this hand is your hand, this hand is my hand, is that hand your hand? no wait thats my hand!" although in my case perhaps it should be more along the lines of is that brain your brain?

Jo, in your emails siggies you have the url for this blog, you need to take off the www so it is just http://el-bloggo.blogspot.com then it will work properly. Right now I'm doing textiles homework.

       Well today woz ok i suppose escept for the fact that i stayed behind after schoolfor 2 hours doing bloody IT coursework and im doing that again tmor. So help me GOD ! Once again i didnt do one thing in science i didnt even bother to unpack my bag, what joyus fun. I think Mr moore needs to get some control over the class. He never seems to teach us anything becuase he gets sidetracked and ends up chatting to a group of people in the corner dont ya think ? Everybody is getting well excited about leaving, we still have most of next week yet! I cant believe people are already bringing in cameras and stuff. Fair enough people bringing in the boooks for people to write in becuase it takes time to do that. Everybody is just going hyper and it is making me feel left out ! I am already fed up of school and i cant seem to get myself motivated i still have my french homework to do but i cant be bothered so that will be done on the thursday, which in fact is very stupid because there is loads to do ! Ahhhhhhhhh Just to  let you know Mr Moore is the sexiest teacher in the school other than Miss Kay of course ! Well im now off for my dinner cause i am starving and i need some nutrician (soz bout spelling) toodles

       Well I didn't have such an interesting day, infact I didn't really have anything interesting in my day. At all. I did quite a bit of work, doing everything I should have done over the last two weeks. I went for a swim, that's quite exciting, lots of water and stuff. So other than all that, everything is a bit alsage.

       No more days left, lol. Went to the Europa Centre today, have to say that although the journey was deadful and Ms Slark really irritated me, the centre was actually ok. Mainly because the people told me I speak good french. But it was okay. I booked a 2 week holiday to Austria to go skiing, and then Jackie and I are sharing a caravan tomorrow night, for 2 nights. What fun. I also bought some shampoo which cost me 18 (rip off!), and some coffee and cheese. Oh, and a hat. Jackie purchased the lovliest pink bag, have to say that it suited her so well! Ha ha. But the journey was awful. Hours of the tube (about 26 stops I think, on the smelly district line). Then it was raining, and the teachers didn't know whre we were going- they had to stop and ask for directions!! Then on the way back Ms Slark said we all had to  get off the train at East Croydon, even though the train we were on would have taken us straight home, and if we got off the train we'd just be getting striahgt back on it. But no, we have to get off. So after a lot of arguing I was quite cross. But then right at the last minute the 3 of us who wanted to get the East Grinstead train just announced that was what we were going to do and legged it before she could say much! But it would have been really stpuid otherwise, and probably ad ded about 30 minutes onto our journey. Bloody hopeless teachers. Anyway! What's everyone else been up to today?

       What would we do without the internet?  Yes, thank you Max for organising all that, jolly good fun - I would love to go again, perhaps in the summer guys? The photos I took should be around on Wednesday or Thursday, should be a good laugh. One more day left guys, then 8 school days and that is it!

       Good Good. I had a marvellous day, I really enjoyed it, and I was so chuffed that i didn't fall over! Okay, a few near misses, but at least I'm still in one piece (except for the blisters on my ankles!). I really enjoyed myself, haven't had a good bit of fun in a long time! It proibably won't be that lo ng before I go back, Nancy reckons I'm taking her next weekend, ha ha! No. Maybe later in the summer. Anyway, thanks to max for organising it, and thanks to everyone else for making it such an enjoyable day!  Tomorrow is the Europe centre, which will probably be as boring as hell. Providing that I can actually walk to get there, lol. But you don't know, miracles may happen! Anyway, see ya later guys, I'm off to get some beans on toast!

        I can do excitement! I can do excitement!   Well. Perhaps not. But at least I tried. But I am looking forward to ice-skating otmorrow! I've only ever been once before, so I'm begging people, please don't dessert me tomorrow!" I'll probably spend most of the day flat on my back, but hey! It's all fun really. I#'ve even bought a little disposable camera to capture everyone making prats of themselves, he he! Anyway! Nicki, that song is probably by Good Charlotte? If not, I'm guessing that's it's Drops of Jupiter, by Train? But it's probably the first one! lol. Anyway, busy day at work today, insane people wanteing to buy the most bizarro things meant I was up and down a ladder all day. Anyway, too knackered to talk and my fingers are all bleeding, I must go and bandage them up, till tomorrow peoples!

       Now that she's back in the atmosphere, With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey, She acts like summer and walks like rain, Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, Since the return from her stay on the moon, She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey. Tell me did you sail across the sun, Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded, And that heaven is overrated, Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star, One without a permanent scar, And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there.

       Well. Today i got up. Ate. Got dresssed. Rummaged through the bomb site (formerly known as my room) and tried to find my english book. Attempted the end half of and essay. Got bored because it was so dull and dreary. Gave up. Had a piece of toast for lunhc at 11am. Played midtown madness for 45 minutes. Walked to the village to go to work. Worked in shop for 4 and a half hours. Encountered some veyr strange people. Packed up. walked home. Played midtown madness until dinner. Tried to make CD work- it won't. Currently sitting here. Wondering what to do. It's rainging. Yuck. Might come back later. Might not.

       Very nice! Even though, for some bizarro reason, none of the pictures can be found by Yahoo. Stupid server. Anyway! Today I went to Croydon again wit my sisters, they were both bargain hutning. Nancy got a pair of those rave trousers (with the tassley bits and stuff all down them, strings and whot not, lol!) and they are blue, Louise bought a couple of tops I think? I really can't rememebr! We were in Alders hours and she tried on about 10 different things, but bought nothing! What a waste of time, lol. Seeings as I've got nothing planned now until Monday, revision starts tommorrow. Anyone who reads this blog regularly will notice that I've said that every day, but this time I really mean it :(  I'm off, see you later guys.

       I got bored so I did this:  We were supposed to leave the school on our double decker coach at 04.30PM.  urlLink Jack  urlLink ie  came up to say hi. I think  urlLink Darren  did, I'm not sure. Didn't leave until about 07.00PM. Why? Well the coach was late. Then they had to keep repacking the luggage bit because there wasn't enough room. Plus there was a big ol crack in the front of the upper section which they thought was dangerous. Because of the late start we missed about 3 ferrys to France. Eventually we got on one at about 10.30PM. While waiting to get booked on this ferry we had great fun at the front of the coach taking  urlLink pictures ! And generally being hyper. The coach trips there and back were probably the best bit of the trip!  urlLink Madness ! To get to our designated (love that word) hotel we had to pass through France,  urlLink Switzerland  and Italy. Long trip but fun. The hotel was cool, had to  urlLink get up  each morning at 7am! There were many o amusing moments throughout the week. In Verona  urlLink Jane  ate a Kinder egg. The toy was this Virgin Mary staute so we built it and put it at the front of the coach. About a minute later a nun crossed the road!!!!!  We even brought some football shirts and made our own  urlLink team ! If ever to go to Venice make sure you get a ride on the  urlLink gondalas . Take an art book! Do some  urlLink sketching ! Ever met  urlLink Peggy ? Of course we were  urlLink cream-crackered  on the way home. Maybe that was because were up  urlLink late .... But whenever you go on a group holiday, always take a  urlLink group photo .

       I saw Tom in Croydon! It was really scary, i was talking to my friend about e-mailing people and I was saying "I e-mail Tom alot cos he's always there", look up and who's walking towards us, but Tom? It was REALLY scary! Anyway. I bought a CD today but it's for Lisa's birthday so I shouldn't really post here what it is just in case someone accidently lets slip, lol! What else did I get? Oh yeah, a beanie baby Babboon as a late easter pressent for my sister, cos she was moaning abut me not getting her one, and it was cheap, lol. Cheap-skate me. Other than that I got a little book too! For all you lot to write it, ha ha!

              I bought this album today in Croydon. It's really good, tell you more when I've finished listening to it! Good film, Johnny English, kept a smile on my face for the whole time, very good. Atkinson as good as ever, I don't think I've seen him in a new film or movie for ages? I also bought a little book for all you guys to write in on the last day of term - getting excited now, year 11s almost over! Nothing going on much in my life really. This looks quite interesting, somebody is going to turn the whole Who Wants To Be A Millionaire thing with the cheater into a movie  urlLink Millionaire scam to become film  - should be interesting.

       Lol. Tom, did you know that Julz's oboe teacher is Pete Long's girlfriend/wife (can't remember which)? Pete Long being a member of Jool's Rhythm & Blues Orchestra? She is going to have a sneaky word with her and see what she can arrange, but nothing promised though, but wouldn't that be cool?!! I cannot wait! Seems like everyone has got Jools fever at the moment!  I can't wait for Bon Jovi either- that will probably be the best gig that I've ever been too, although we will probably get deafened!! Yahooooooo!  In the end I didn't see the 300th episode of the Simpsons last night, I went to bed and watched the film about Anne Frank, which was qutie interesting. I might try to read it again, I  think. I read a lot of it when I was in year 4, but it was a bit advanced for me then and I didn't really understand all of it, and eventually my teacher told me to give up and read something more normal (teachers for you, eh?!). But I might get it out the library and read it after the exams of something, seeings as I will probably have a lot of spare time on my hands! Anyway. I've just come back from clearing up the kitchen, I went down there annd there was dozens of bowls, plates and glasses on the side, so I opened the dishwasher and found it was full of dirty plates (or so i thought). So, I washed and dried up all this stuff, took me over half an hour to do, only for Nancy to walk in and say "What are you doing that for? The dishwasher is clean, y ou've just got to empty it" and I thought some very rude things then! i was also quite cross cos I'd squeezed a couple of plates, a glass and quite a bit of cutlery into the dishwasher, so I had to try and decide which was clean and which wasn't! Worst thing was, I was about to run the dishwasher cos I'd filled it up with the powder and eveyrhting, so I would have been re-washing most of it! Geez I am so thick sometimes! After all that I have decided not to do any revision this morning seeings as it is nearly lunch anyway, I will just mess around playing computer games, and after lunhc I will do some serious revision! (says she who has said that eveyr day yet done none properly yet). Anyway, toooodle-oooo guys.

       When I went to see Jools Holland in the Royal Albert Hall they where 45 minutes late, so the crowd decided to start a mexican wave. The only problem is the Royal Albert Hall has circular seating going to whole way round the building so the wave didn't stop until the music started, just kept going on, and on, and on. The best bit was when a group of people tried to start another one going in the other direction, it lasted for a little while until the two met and it fell apart a bit.

My job is at a little DIY come homecare shop in Warlingham, I have been there for three weeks now and I'm enjoying it! Anywya, can't really type veyr well cos I've just burnt my middle finger on the sandwich toaster and it's gone all funny already, I will probably end up with a blister which is not going to be fun on the pad of my finger! Anyway, I really ought to do some revision today, so I'd better go before the Simpsons at 9.30! Bye guys

       Just got back from a few days up in Manchester. I went with mother to see Ronan Keating at the MEN Arena. It holds 18,000 and looks small but you don't realise at first that there is a second tier up above you! It was a good laugh. The stewards were trying to get a Mexican wave going, eventually they did and it was so fun. The concert itself was better than at Wembley. Maybe it was because he had some more dates under his belt I'm not sure. Maybe it was because there were more people? And that the audience was younger? But it was good. Veyr good atmosphere, everyone was up for it and jumping about. When he came on at the back of teh arena for the encore 'Pump It Up' and the whole audeinece was clapping and stuff I could just picture this track being shown somewhere like the Hard Rock Cafe. What is your job Jo? Max please blog. That is a request. A couple more and sposh, you'll be gone.

       lol, it was quite funny. Dad kepy piping in about burying giblets under the patio, for some reason. Nancy was throwing up in the lounge cos she is really ill, she has been up since 3am crying, she is so hot you could fry eggs on her, and she has been sick numerous times. Also she is being very "mummyfied" today, and won't be in a room without mum, so when we were eating lunch she was sprawled on the sofa. Which wasn't a good idea, seeings as she could see and smell the food.

       Really? Cool. I've just had my yummy lunch! Roast Turkey with bread sauce and lots of roastie potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, and gravy! And to finish it off yummy mini eggs! we had a really weird discussion though, we were tlaking about digging the patio up, and thne mum started saying she doesn't know why people bother to bury bodies under the patio cos it's so much work, then we started talking about how you do it etc etc. Then it emerged that Louise had gone to get a cloth out the sink, but she reached into the sink and grabbed the turkey giblets! OOooh it was funny! All this while poor Nancy is throwing up in the lounge. Marvellous, I love Easter.

       It is next Monday he comes home, or perhaps even Tuesday. I'm not sure, but I am quite positive it is one of those two days! Brad Pitt's bottom sounds like a very good piece of artwork, anyone fancy a trip to Madame Tussauds sometime soon........................??! Anyway! I've been at work all day and my knees and feet are killing me, but I really enjoy it cos it is so interesting and I'm active all day! Beats sitting on my butt watching the tv or whatever! Anyway, she has decided she needs some extra help next week, so I'm working Friday as well as Saturday, and possibly even Wednesday and Thursday! So extra money coming my way this week, lol! Its quite nice though cos Tina (who works there) likes to gossip, and sometimes when its quite we just chat about stuff! She's always asking my what I'm doing tonight (as in Saturday night) and it's quite sad cos I always have to say "staying home and watching tv"!!! At least at the mo I have the excuse that I'm too busy revising for my exams, lol. But she was quite interested to hear about the BonJovi concert that I've got lined up! Weather is horrible today, it's been threatening to rain all day, and even when it wasn't drizzling it was soooo windy! half the pots outside the shop decided to blow away, so one of my duties today was chading them all down the road! One of the wheelie bins also decided to go for a roll which was quite annoying, it wouldn;'t stay still! In the end I tied it to one of the metal bins. I really shoudl shut up now because you lot probably really don't want to hear about my dustbins and whotnot but hey! My faminly aren't in a listening mood cos they've been digging up the patio all day and are now comatosed on the sofa, so I thought I'd come and blog to get everything out of my system! That's the problem with not talking for a lot of the day- you have to let it all out eventually! Anyway, I really will leave you in peace now, have fun tomorrow guys and don't eat too much chocolate! We've got a novel new experiment going on in our house- no chocolate of any sort for easter. Whoppee. But I guess I'll be thankful in the long run! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

       It's either this Sunday or next Sunday. Just catching up on the news and I have found that Madame Tussaud's waxworks are not made of wax! Only the head and hands are, the rest is fibre glass. Only one exception which is brand new this week, Brad Pitt's bottom, which is made from a foam and silicon mixture to make it squeezably lifelike.

       Well so far this holiday i have not revised one iota ! Really i need some little person at my side to come up to me and go : Rivise you little scoundle u, or i will rip your head off and flush it down the loo! I think that way i would sit down and do some revision. But my problem is i find it so god damn boring! Id rather sit outside and burn my eyes out than revise !  The reason i dont come on during the day is because it costs a bomb if you dont have broadband, which idont have so therefore it means i cant come on during the day. I have only just realside that because it is a bank holiday today i could have come on earlier because it is cheap! But neva mind at least i am on half an hour earlier than usual.  I went down the park today with a couple of friends but it woz sooooooooo boring that we ended up coming back early ( i mean like we were down the park for less than an hour ) That dobbins hill really does your legs in even if you are used to going up it ! I think in toal i stopped like 20 times because i got knackered after going up like 3 steps. Nicki isnt coming on here today or tonight because she is up in Manchester i think and is seeing another Ronan concert with her mutter. Tom is on holiday in the Lake districk (I think) with Andy Pandy. Max is with his lovely girlfriend Nic at this moment in time so is probably too busy to deal with blogging! LOL ( they make a really good couple ) I have nothing else planned for the holidays although i want to go and see Jhonny English, hopefully dat will happen and i also have that Europa trip to look forward to on the extra day we have off. Oh what joys, I am begining to think it was a bad idea becuase you dont get to choose who you go with in a group, you just get shoved in a group as you go through "Customs". Which means i could end up with David Andrews or even Joanna. Ahhhhhhhh. Only kidding Jo ! I am dreading the french speaking cause i cant even understand what the teacher goes on about in english let alone what she is saying in french ! But hopefully i will get half decent grades in the other bits to give me a decent grade overall. You must be bored by reading this by now so i will leave you to blog for yourself or to ignore everything i have just writen ! hehe bye

       Where is everybody?!!! Is everybody revising? But surely you can't revise all day, everyday, and every night? Get a life peeps! Okay, I admit, I have been nrevising a lot, but I am still fiding time to pop in here and blog, to let whoever bothers to read the blog know what's going on in our little world!  Well, today it is still sunny but there is quite a strong wind, therefore it is nowhere near as hot as yesterday. However, sitting in a south-facing room with all the w indows shut, I am sweltering. Mother and Father are destroying the patio (it has one end missing now and a big hole in the middle) with sledge hammers, apparently it has sunk and they need to re-set it? Well, I haven't a clue what they're doing but they've just discovered it is built on mud (ha ha, yet another botch job from the builders!), and dad has got all of next week off to do it. Except he is going to a motorbike show on Monday. Louise is lying in the hammock (very suave) wearing a suntop, sunglasses and a towwl (not quite sure what happened to the rest of her clothes), and reading Harry Potter 4. Nancy is at the bottom of the garden wearing a pair of polythene gloves (??) And playing with a friend's guinea pigs that we are looking after while they are away in the Peak District. I suppose I sholudb't complain that they're down the garden, earlier Louise marched in and demanded that I held one of the pigs whilst she made a cup of tea. Animals are fair enough, but when you have to hold them for long periiods of time you begin to wonder how strong their bladders are. But I guess guinea pigs' bladders are stronger than my little cousin Matthew's (aged 2 1/2, visited yesterday), as sometime yesterday afternoon he managed to wee down Louise's top. That's a bit worrying, cos I've just realised that Louise is wearing the top again today and there was no wash load done last night..................... At the moment I'm in the middle of writing out ALL my geography case studies onto little cue cards, so I can play snap like games! Yay! I have done 3 out of 6 of my French aural topics, so I'm gradually getting there, I just need to go through them all and get mother to tell me how to pronounce half the words, lol! When I've finished the geography case studies I think I will go on and do some more on the Cold War, as I need to brush up on the space race and the arms race. It's always the things that you haven't revised properly that come up on the damned exams, so I'm gonna try and make sure i know everyhting inside-ou by the time we get to the exams! I have a month till the first exam (Music and RE on the first day), and then another week before any more exams (thank god for half terms!!). So really I'm stressing about things that aren't really gonna be that big a problem (I sincerely hope!). I just need a bit more sself-discipline, so I can work for 2 hours instead of giving up after and hour and then playing 30 minutes on this fab game called 'Super Bounce Out'. Oh the joys. Please blog guys (do I sound like Nicki?!!!) cos I am as bored as hell, haven't spoke to any of my friends for ages, and I'll go insane if there's nothign to do apart from play with various virtual multi-coloured rubber bouncy balls. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee guys.

       Well, I'm here, well for the moment anyway. Yes i have been sunning myself although it woz a bit to windy to do it today. I have been to the cinema with Nicki today to see: Blue Crush. It was actually better than expected, i thought it was gonna be a really boring film but it wasnt ! I have already got myself a tan, but i can always improve it and it will be better if i have a tan b4 i go to majorca cause that way i will come back looking fine! (hopefully with some boys numbers) Hehe In fact i cant wait for my holiday, which is not that long away now ! Woooohooooo But first i have the boring task of revising for my GCSE's and then the task of actually doing them. eek well enough of my boring chit chat ill be off now to leave u in some peace.

       Me again. It's 11am and I've done 30 m,inutes revision on teh Cold War, it's suprising how much I can remember, having already revised it thoroughly twise (for yr 10 exmas and mocks) so I don't actually have veyr much to worry about it! On to Germany next I thinks! Anyway, weather is beautiful again, but I am hiding in my room all day today because my aunt is coming (which is always a complicated procedure). She always phones up and invites her and her 2 boys (both under 5) round, they make a fowl mess, she talks absolute rubbish, mum doesn't like her, and they never leave (plus they always arrive at least an hour early, and frequently phone up at 8,30 when we're all still aslepp). Fun. Mum has told her today that I'm revising all day (I really don't feel like seeing them), therefore I'm staying in my room all day, I don't think I'll even venture down for lunch! Much safer to stay up here when she's around. So, back to history I guess, thought I'd just pop in here for a bit while I give my eyes a break! Acutlaly, beeter go and get some drink supplies if I'm hibernating all day. Later peeeeeps.

       IYo peeps. I have been having such a busy week I haven't had much time for revision yet, alrthough I have done bits and bobs that I needed to sort! Proper revision starts tomorrow though, when my sis has no more hordes of friends round (thank god!). But, at least we have glorious weather! Mum and I sat out in the garden this afternoon, we are both as white as sheets so we have decivede that we needed to tan! Unfortunatley I'm still as white as when I started, but hey, I'mm looking after my skin and I 'm not gonna look 40 when I'm 20 (me hopes!!). Anyway, gotta go, people to go, places to see.......bye!

       I'm here. Have been here all weekend, apart from yesterday when I was working from 9 till 5, and when I got home I was knackered so I ate dinner and then watched Harry Potter that someone had bought yesterday. Today my uncle came round as it was Lou's birthday, and among all the nice pressies she got 2 dance mats and the Ps game, so we have been on that all afternoon, and I mean since about 2.30! It's now 5 and I've only just given uip, ha ha! Tomorrow I'm going to France for the day with a firned so I probably own't blog as I will be back late, and when I do get back I will try and fit some revision in! That is what I'm going to do now- revision. After a second helping of that triple-chocolate-truffle-900calories a slice-Thornton's-cake..........................

       Ah yes! I was wondering where Tom was, and I've just remembered that he has gone to Thorpe Park too, so I'm all alone, :( No worries though, I've had a lazy morning! Got up about 9.45 having been woken up by Nancy shouting "Bye Jo!" about 3 million times before she went out to school, and got woken up by Louise charging around like a looney in order to get a 7.50am train- crAzy!!! So, I got up, leisurely got dressed, did some washing (aren't I helpful?), read a magazine, had a veyr long phone call to my friend Sarah, ate lunch, now I'm here! What fun. It's flippin' cold outside, hope you guys haven't frozen to death yet, cos that wouldn't be very good.  I've got everyhting sorted out for the ball now, and I'm sooooooooooo excited! My hair is gonna be so cool (even if I say so myself!), and I think I'm gonna look quite different, he he! I'm also going to pick up my dress this afternoon, so everthing will be perfect! Yay! My friend had her ball last night (Riddlesdown) and she said the limo was fab, they were all hanging out the windows and waving at anyone possible, so that's something we've gotta try guys! I think it's gonna be brilliant! Who si eveyrone having their photos taken with? Or are you lot having them done on your own? Sarah said they managed to get about 7 people in theirs, I'm looking forward to seeing it to see what it turns out like, ha ha! Generally she had a fab time, but I think ours is gonna be HUGE! Really posh place, nice food, good music, all our friends, having one heck of a time!  Right, I reallly shoiuld go and do some work now. I'm going to start by copying up Nicki's history, so I can either post it through her door tonight, or it will perhaps be Sunday? I don't know, gimmie a yell if you need it before then Nicki! Tooooooooodle pip guys. Don't really know why I'm saying that, seeings as none of you are here, but hey. Tooooooooooooodles pips.

I am going to be wiped out by the end of the day ! anyway ill be off now i may as well start getting my stuff ready, that way i will have more time to do stuff in the morning ! HeHe see ya all tmor !

       My nose hurts. And I have just discovered I have an infection in my eaar (as in actually inside my ear lobe)- it was really hurting so I was rubbing it, and discovered this big lump inside my ear lobe. Mother says it is not normal, and I htink it is because I am allergic to alot of my earings. I have just thrown most of my earings in the bin. But how my ear hurts- Nicki I totally sympathesise with you.

       I was in a good mood earlier anyways because  1) I'm going to Thorpe Park  2) American forces are in Baghdad and Brittish have now taken Basra. Its great!!! Now I'm not because of the dumbass lot round the other conrer who decided to push down our human pyramid. You have no idea how much my head hurts now. I really hate Marc, JFK and Flandrews right now and I will gold this as a long term grudge.

Even the set 5's of our year know that the summer exam is going ot be on everyhting we've done this year! Geeeez, he irritated me today. We've been doign forces to death when we coudl have been revising more useful things, like the stuff no-one gets in waves and radiation. Flippin' heck, dudes.

       I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel. Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you. I was dreaming while I drove, the long straight ahead. To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. Is that all right? I drove all night.  What in this world keeps us from tearing apart? No matter where I go I hear the beating of your heart. I think about you when the night is cold and dark. No-one can move me the way that you do, nothing erases this feeling between me and you.  I drove all night, to get to you, is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. I drove all night, is that all right? I drove all night.  To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. Is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room, woke you from your sleep to make love to you.  I drove all night. To taste your sweet kisses you arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night.   Honey love love, ooh it'd ease my mind. I need to find time, someone to call mine. My mamma said you can't hurry  love, no you';ll just have to wait. She said 'love don't come easy, its a game of give-and-take'.  urgh this one is way too fast for me. Never mind.

       What lovely weather today. I went to Andys breifly today because he needed to give me the money for the photos. I got to see the pups. They are so lovely. Helen was with me because he needed to give her a birthday present. I got to pick em up and stuff. Holly is lovely, she is so sweet. She kept coming in now an dthen tocheck on them and when they started whining she came in. Bless. You can see their personalities already, the lazy one, the attention seeker, the bully...lol. I'm feeling really down though at the moment. Everything is just so, pants.  I have found that every year my hayfever is different. This year my brain feels like it is wrapped up in cotton wool.

       What do you do if you think a friend needs help? Like serious help, not just that she's struggling at school or something. What do you do? What if this friend pushes away all the time, won't let anyone in? What if she won't speak to you, won't tell you anything, yet you thought you were her trusted best friend, just as you trusted her? What if she's changed so much you just don't know who she is, you don't understand her? But what do you do if you think this could turn out very badly for her? As in she might do something very stupid, but you can't talk to her, nor her family about it?   What do you do??????

       Well, what an interesting day. At least it is hot now, and I've been doing maths and history i the garden all day, now I am a bit roasty, but hey! Our phone line is dead, no-one can call us, and when pick up the phone you just hear nothing, not even the dialing tone. And it would be on a day that I need to call loads of people to sort stuff out! Plus my phone battery just died. And I discovered I only had 3p credit so I had to go out and buy some more. The umbrella shading me from the scorching sun in the garden keeps falling over. And then to top it all, a bird flies over and craps on my history book. Oh the jiys of living in the Great British countryside.  Hope whoever went to the cinema had fun, that film sounded good at first but then the trailers looked a bit silly, and hope people who went to the fair didn't get too burnt, and didn't spend all their hard-earned money!!

       I think today most people have either gone to the fair or to the cinema to see 'How To Loose A Guy In 10 Days'. I hope you all have fun! I am doing revision today because I was out yesterday and will be out tomorrow. Wahey. Ttyl.

       Hey guys! I've just got back from Legoland, and boy did I have fun!! Firstly I got in free (saved me 19) and then the first ride I went on, I got so wet I had to walk round wearing wet underwear all day!! all in all it was a great day, I won't bore you all with the details right now!

       I had a fun day today. I went shopping with Pennie and got a new top and earrings. We had a nice pizza hut buffet lunch which was nice. On my way out I saw Angela so I spoke with her for a bit. Her and Simon are so sweet. Speaking of Simons, Jackie......in fact I will pester you on msn now.

       Aww, poor Jackie. Sometimes it does that to me when I am on msn, if teh connect cuts out for a second you are signed out and I never realise so I start to wonder why no one is talking and they realise I have been offline for about ten minutes. Which can be crucial. I didn't know Tom was leaving and this may be late to Tom but: Have a good time! I was forced into science revision earlier. I have done all the enviroment topic now. Bet I won't remember it but I tried. I can't handle the history. Its way too hard. I may go and find Mr Weston after half term to ask for any revision tips for history. I am drinking the most disgusting drink. Lilt. Yuk! I am only drinking it because its fizzy. I am meeting up with Pennie tomorrow to do our Sk8er Boi stalking and then to buy a new top for Friday. It should be a laugh.

       lol okay bey bye Jackie! I htink Tom has gone to Greece sailing, although I ahd totally forgotten that he was going on holiday, i had just heard him mentioning it! But I think that must be where he has gone. Um, nice weather today, sat in the garden and did some revision for about 3 hours, the most I've done yet!! Weather was nice but now it's come over a bit cloudy, hence me being on the PC now! Got to go and pick Nancy up from Guide camp later, so the peace in our house will be broken! aww!  I'm off cos I'm eternally bored. Bye bye!

       Oh Bollox, just great. I write a nice long blog press post and publish and then reaslise that my connection to the internet had stopped and i have lost everything i wrote in there. FUCK ( scuse the language) Well Tom has gone to a hot country, but unfortuantly i cant remeber which one. I actually asked tom to write where he was going and what he woz gonna do but he obviousoly couldnt be bothered. Well i went to my cousins yesterday, they live in Oxted and have a mahoosive house and garden. I love it. Btw Jo one of my cousins is gonna be in the upper 6th at Oxted. Jo i will wear themed clothing if that is what you wish foir, although that will mean i will need to  go on another shopping trip into Croydon.... Thats not a bad thing though :) Have any of you been invited to a party at Goff's house on the Saturday? ( day after Helen and Pennies) I have been invited but i dont want to go if no one is gonna go ! Oh yea, i still cant work out how you get pictures on here, its too confusing Well that is it from me - The wisdom woman, farwell and goodbye

And half the people who I thought were my friends have either refused to dress up to my party, or are putting me second by saying, oh btw I'm only coming an hour before the end cos I can't be assed to turn up for the whole time. Great. Thanks a bunch, 'friends'. I am really pissed off righ tnow.

       Admit what? Did Nicki fancy your friend Jackie? Is that what all the strange italics is about? Anywya, Jo's party was brill last night, it was a proper house party (ie parents cleared out and we had the run of the downstairs etc and the garden), and all in all it was a good laugh! Today I went to work and i've been on my feet all day, they are aching sooooo much! There is sod all on the tv tonight apart from the Euroviaion thing that I WON'T  be watching, especailly as those gay Russian girls are singing. And of course dad is so busy cementing the patio he can't go out to blockbusters, so it looks like I'm going to be reduced to doing some revision tonight. How marvellous. Anyway, cya later guys

       German reading yesterday. They spent about half an hour faffing about. Idiots. But no more German! Ever!!!!!! I wnet to see The Matrix Reloaded with Jackie as she said. Yes it was nice seeing  a boy from my primary school that i havent seen for 5 years ! It was nice seeing him after all that time.  Hehe. Mwahahaha. I loved the film. I don't think it was better or worse than the first. I think its partly because of the way the directors designed the triolgy. As with most trilogys the first film like X-men introduces you to the characters and the story. In this case its helping us to understand the Matrix. Now the 2nd and 3rd films will be jam packed of action as we see neo work out he reasons why he is The One. Btw, Neo is an agagram for one. Hehe.

It was nice seeing him after all that time. The film was great, lots of action and suspence, although i do believe that the first film was better as it woz more interesting. Now all i have to do is wait until The Matrix Revolutions comes out in Novemeber. Well for those of you that went to Jo. C birthday party, did you have fun? or woz andy's party better? Big Brother has finally arrived, YAY. I already hate one of the housemates called anouska, she is so annoying and loud, she is up for eviction so that is good.

       Yeha, I though that was quite okay actually, easier than the praactice exams that we were given!! I thought the ROll of Thunder question was a bit tricky tho, asking all this nonse about how much has Cassie learnt of the right and wrong wasy to live? Ridiculous. Anyway, I thought it was okay. I never bother to plan cos it just wastes my time, and I never pay any attention to the plans anyway, so from my experience it;s more worthwhile for me just to start writing, and worry about what I do next when I do actually get stuck, which thankfully dind't happen. But I guess everyone is different! I suddenyl think iof random things to write.  So, History revision class tomrrow, I hope you're going Nicki otherwise I'll be lonely! Then a week off- bliss!  CAn't wait, havent' got all tht much planned though because I want to do a lot of revision.

       Oh yea baby! I kicked ass on that exam!!!!!!!! Eng Lit is the only exam I ever look forward to you know because I never find them incredibly hard like maths or science. The only problem I had in that exam was that I kep forgetting to start a spiderdiagram or a list of things to include in the essay so each time I wrote the introduction THEN did a small list above that. I think it will be okay though. That lepricorn teacher and another English teacher are so rude! They stood right by my table chatting away, flapping pieces of paper right by my ear while I was trying to work. How rude! They could have distracted me (which they did) and damaged my chances of a good grade! Then the lepricorn put her cup of coffee ON MY DESK. HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I had a good mind to knock it off 'by accident' but couldn't be bothered. Too much effort really. Good luck everyone! I hope you did well!

       Yes! never ever have to sit through another music lesson ever, anything I do to do with music will be strictly voluntary from now on! And to celebrate, Tom and I have had simulatneous book burnings! I burnt my book which wasn't entierly successful, firstly it wouldn't light, and when it finally caught light some dead leaves caught alight too, and set fire to the fence!! OOPS! when I'd finished, I cam back up and found a folder full of notes and songs from choir, which of course I had to burn too! This was a little more successful, I went down behind the wall at the bottom and created a nice little bonfire, whihc burnt very well for about half an hour until it started to rain. But all my music is now reduced to ashes, which actually feels like a great relief. Ok, so it's vandalism. Ok it ruins the atmosphere. And ok, a few flowers got singed. But hey,. it'ss a weight off myh mind!

His genius is only surpassed by his love and understanding of other people.  He makes for a great companion with much affection, plus, the baldness *is* kinda sexy.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate?

       Morning. I hope Jackie's PE goes wall today! And anyone else who has an exam!    Your ideal mate is Bobby Drake.  With his innocent sweetness and his boyish good looks, how can any girl go wrong?  He's the type of guy to supply you with all the TLC that you can handle, and he'll always be there for you when you need moral support, or just a shoulder to cry on.  Though he is still young, he lacks the experiences of life, and can be naive.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate? (ladies only)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Well, i had my french oral today, it woz well hard and i hated every god damn minute of it. I think i did okay though, probably got half marks? I got health and Eduaction, i would say they were the best 2, cause environment is well hard and so is youth culture ans future plans. Well my next exam is PE so i really have to revise a lot for that, i want to get an A and i know that i can get it if i try really hard. I would say it is my best subject so fingers crossed. Does anyone want to come Job hunting with me? I want to go into croydon some time next week and have a look. Well thats it from me.

       well wht lovelly weather today. I got up about 9am this morning and pottered around for 3 hours, then decided to clear out my room, seeings as I have a huuuge amount of junk stashed away.I started with under my bed, where I foudn a ridiculour number of plastic carrier bags and loads of old chritsmas cards, then I moved onto my desk which contained thousands of unwanted, unloved, unused pens, which promptly went in the bin. NOw if you come into my room you can see the carpet, and it is possible to find what you want in my desk, which is quite an achievement. I also got round to changing the sheets and vacumink all the dust of the paintwork, and then I did an hour's revision before lunch and Neighbours! Since then I have been reivising/chatting on messenger, cos the weather is so foul I can't really be bothered to do anything properly at the moment. I've got to go out before 4pm to be at school for our first Austria rehersal, which I am so not looking forward to. If I get stuck in the front row I will scream, I really will! Also, Mrs Hicks reckons we need a bass guitar for a couple fo songs, so I dread to think what she's got in store for us, probably a shed load of stupid gospel songs that require singing stupid words and waving our arms around like loonies, cos that's what we usually end up doing. Only this year we've got Mrs Kent too, who altough she is nicer than Mrs Hicks, she picks out the most ridiculous songs for her choirs to sing.  Oh well, the joys of music. Even though my street cred is going ot be ruined after this, at least I'm leaving you lot here!  Must go finished some revision before I have to go and suffer torture, toodle pip guys!

       OOOH, also they do it so the first 2 people get the first set of topics, then the second 2 people get the second set of topics, and so on. So if you're clever enough (but it's a bit c onfusing) you could work out what you may have! But that is a bit too confusing!

       Well thank God the aurals are over and done with! I think mine went quite well, or at least Madame Slark was grinning the whole way through, lol! Jackie, in case you wanted to know, the topics that go together are: Self and Family + Environment Health + Education Youth Culture + Future Plans Anyway, for the rest of the morning Tom, Doe, Alex and I sat on the grass and had a laugh at Mr Weston who seemed quite embarrased that we all knew about the poster- nice one Nicki! Alex then walked home, and we went to my house via the chip shop, and had chip butties! I can't believe that Tom and Doe hasve never had chip butties! They weren't the best I've ever had cos really you need thicker bread, more butter and hotter chips, lol! But next time, we have to have fish finger sandwiches, they are just the best!! Bananas are ucky in sandwiche tho! Anyway I've got to do some revision tonight seeings as I've been out all day, lol! See y'all later guys (hope your art is going ok Nicki!!)

       That was amusing. While talking to Pete last night he said Mr gallagher saw it, looked suprised but thinks he took it down. My sister said Seaward left the one on his door up and I think Mr Weston found his one amusing. It was fun while it lasted. I got an email from Mr Bennett because I sent him some of the ball pics as he wasn't there. He wante dto know what Helen was doing in one of the pictures and I quote him when he says: "what is helen doing with her face in the limo?". I couldn't stop laughing at that. Anywho, yes. Got up about 20 mins ago. I have German second lesson then I'll be over to collect Jackie for lunch and revision. I have already have 2 texts from Doe and a phonecall from Jenny which didn't get far because her battery ran out. Brilliant. See you all later!

       Lol, today was fun, French for me was a waste of time, i thought we were gonna go through the oral topic so i was kinda annoyed at that. Nicki put the photos of the scicen lot drunk up round the school but within bout half an hour most of them had been taken down ! :( I dont think they like them much although Mr Moore did. Well after the french i went back to Nicki's house and we have now organised a revision session tmor in Croydon library, I cant beleuve im doing it but there ya go ! Hehe. Well nothing much more to say. I'm off

       ok Well I finally got my necklace back (he he!) after Jackie forgot, so I went to science revision and Jackie went home to get it for me. I went to french second lesson which was actually quite handy, and then I went to see Miss Bashir with Scott and ssarah which was VERY helpful! She's set up a few more dates when we can go in adn see her to go through loads of stuff. Which is useful. Tomorrow I'm doing some more revision (wow!) and going in at 2.30 to see Miss Bashir. Then more work on my french aural, and then mum and I are going to spend the whole day on Wednesday going through them all so I'm fully prepared for Thursday, cos I'm soo nervous about it!  Other than that the day has been really boring, cos I've been revising all day! Not much to say really, so I'm going to go now! Bye

       Yeh he he he he! I had so much fun last night, boogeying and mingling and socialising!  It was absoulately fab, far better than I thought it was going to be! The teachers were hilarious though, all smoking like chimneys and half of them turning up pissed or stoned! What a bad example to set! Anyway, I thorogulsy enjoyed myself and I will remember that night forever, I really will. It was absoultely brilliant, even down to the last details like Mrs Kent beeping at us on the motoway cos we were all waving out the windows like looneys, oh and of course Oliver winning Best Smile, he was in his element last night! I really thoroughly enjoyed myself, thank you all for making it so special for me! I got to go guys, my hair is still a mess, see you at Andy's!

Well is it only me or are the peeps coming in my limo slightly pissed off?

But anyway im looking forward to seeing you all at the ball your all gonna look fab. Make sure you look ur best for tmors photos.

       I think it was nice of him to write that because he was putting something personal about you rather than a simple 'good luck' like some teachers. Like in mine he wrote something thast really only I would understand properly. Madness. Well ya'll know about my wrist problemo yah? Well I got my mom to look at it (she used to be a nurse) and its def swollen so its def worse that it was! Nooooooooooooooooo! Oh yea, Tom you havn't finished writing in my boooooooooooooooooooook!

So Nikko, see me tomorrow and you'd better get writing! Anyway, in maths today I think Mr Blincoe was trying to suggest that we devise a method of cheating in the maths exam cos he said we need to have a signal to show what is wrong. OH dear, I really hope he wasn't serious, but he sounded as if he was. RE was ok cos we wacthed 'My Big fat Greek Wedding' which is such a funny film! None of my class seemed to get the jokes tho, I htink it was a bit wasted on them! I'm not writin gmuch cos I'm so excited about tomorrow and FRIDAY! I'm gonna just be a ball of e xcitement! If you can be that! But hey! Got to go cos I think Neighbours might be starting soon, bye!

       P.S: If I'm totally insane tomorrow, it's because Louise has spent all morning downloading tracks on the net and burning them onto a CD. It wouldn't be so mad if these songs were decent, but they happen to all be by Alvin and the Chipmunks, and range from things such as 'Play that Funky Music' to 'Macarana' and 'Time Warp'. They are truly dreadful, and to make it worse they're sung by cabbage chipmunks.

       Awww! Very amusing. I didn't do that IQ thing either, I didn't know it was on. I can't actually remember what I did last night. OHyeah I can, I was revising with mother, which was actually helpful. Today I got up about 9.30, ate a leisurley breakfast (cos everyone was alrady up and in the garden), oitered around my room listening to music and chilling, and finally got dresed aboyut 11am. I then did 2 hours on maths before lunch. After lumnch I lay in the hammock in the sun for an hour, then I got attacked by Nancy cos apparently I was a pirate and I might attack the ship she was sailing round the garden. So I grabbed a plastic sword and started fighting back, and it ended with her walking the plank. I then took over the sh ip, but got bored after a while a decided to jump up and down on the exercie trampoline. Then my legs got wobbly so I gave up, went back inside and did some more music appreciation, ha ha. Then I went out for a biyccycle ride with my down all across these fields and stuff, and I can tell you, boy does my back-side hurt. But anyway! I'm going to do some history revision later, and I'm going to do some more science with mother tonight. Toodles pip for now guys (seeings as MSN isn't working), and see you all tomorrow!

       Well I stayed in bed for about half an hour and then my dad convinced me to help him in the garden. Lawn mower doesn't work. So lets go inside and see if I can get the computer to work. Oooo, I know what the problem is, why don't I just move the hard drive into the other computer and then look at it? Good idea, I thought. So I did. Then it caught alight and smoke started to rise out of the computer. Back to the drawing table. Bloody cabages, should have stayed in bed.

       Very good. Unfortunatly I can't do these tests without getting a false mark, so I won't bother. For the following paragraph, replace the word 'cabage' with something that ryhmes with "ducking" and starts with "f". A terrible day. Tried to dig a cabage hole for a cabage plant in the cabage garden, but some cabage idiot built the cabage garden on cabage clay so I can only go about cabage 10cm. Another one of my cabage computers has decided that computer-cabage-life isn't just worth cabage living and is now sulking in the corner of the room not doing anything. I have a cabage head-ache and I can't cabage think straight. It's half past cabage eleven and I'm going to cabage bed.

       Jackie, seeings as I have only just got onto Blogger I will still answer your question! We went into Croydon this morning because you wanted a necklace and a hair accessory for Friday's Leavers Ball. We looked in every shop possible (lol!) and in the end you bought a clear clippy thing that you can put in your hair in about 6 differernt ways for an 'up-do'. Let me know how it goes and how you're going to have you hair! You didn't buy a necklace though. Tom bought some stuff in Next and something in Smiths that completely escapes my mind, and then he bought Die Another DAy in HMV, where he also paid for my Harry Potter CD because he had a voucher to use (but there is money sitting here next to me waiting to be given to him on Tuesday morning!). Then we went home because I had a rehersal to get to, and by the time I had got home I had 10 minutes to eat lunch before I had to go out again! I then went to a rehersal for my concert next week, and I think it's going to be a really good one, even if I say so myself. Imagine 6 clarinets all playing melodiouys and spectacular tunes, and that's what you;'ll get next Sunday! One boy is totally hopeless though, I think he's gonna be kicked out and replaced, lol!!!  Anyway, I have just done a make-up trial for the ball and have decided against weird and wonderful makeup, I'm just gonna go with natural colours on!! Nothing blue or purple, I'm gonna look normal. ANyway, my hair is gonna be quite, um, different, so I don't wanna over do it. Other than that, I'm all sorted now! yay! I'm so excited about it!  I'm going to do some revisoin this evening, and apparently we're going out for a family day tomorrow. Yippe. ACtually, we haven't been out anywhere for ages, so it should be good. Better go, I think I have to go and cook a vegetable curry!

       Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Well today I went to work again. Interesting day in all, encoutered the Warlingham May Queen, a very sexist man, and an old lady who links singing and bendy toilet brushes. Other than that the day was pretty routine, and I get to learn how to use the till next Saturday! How fun!! Sounds sad, but it all looks quite fun really, swiping credit cards and stuff!  Um. Other than that, I was awake half the night last night because I kept having dreams about the ball, and I was so excited about leaving I hardly slept a wink! Hope I get some more sleep before Friday, otherwise I won't make it to the ball! Anyway, we're having a ridiculoursly early dinner otnight cos Nancy has friends round, so better go! Byeeeeee. BTW, see you 10,.30 tomorrow morning Jackie!

       I may pop over to see you but I need someone to go with me. Jackie?? Any takers?    This Is Your Song   Live your life to the fall With a lifetime of smiles Made us know right from wrong Always knowing a lie  You made us to be tough But never too rough Rise above what you said Never easily lead.  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  So I'll try and go on Loving all that we know Through the hardest of times you put on a show  You made us stand tall When all around us would fall Even when you were alone You believed you could fly  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day Just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song We wrote it for you It'll take all our lives Just to help us get through You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song.

       Well if you want somebody to come I am around on that Sunday - chat to me on MSN. We are leaving school! Finished required education! The fact most of us have 2 years of 6th form followed by 3 or 4 at Uni doesn't really matter, but you get the idea! Hehe. I'm actually nervous, and I know I ain't the only one! I've changed my book writing thing slightly, I'm going to buy a book with lined pages for peeps to write messages in and I'm going to use a blank book for signitures from random people and staff, plus I want people to draw a picture of themselves - just something slightly different from the normal thing. I have the photos from the skating, however I didn't use a fast enough film because the shop didn't have it, so unfortunatly they came out really dull, which I am quite annoyed about, but I have got some much faster film now - just got to try again! Jackie was talking about another Thorpe Park trip in July sometime? I can't remember the date, but what do we think? Anyway, I need my beauty sleep, about a decades worth, g'night.

        Well. HEre I am, at last! What a disguisting day. Raining, all day long. There was a brief period of glorious sunshine at about 4pm this afternoon, but since about 5pm it's been simply horrible! Dioesn't crap weather just make you feel awful? I really hope it doesn't do this next Friday, cos a) we're gonna get our outfits soaked, and b) my hair'll get ruined!! But hey! I've got the camera sorted now, mum says I can borrow hers cos it's easy to load and stuff, and she's got me a couple of spare films for lots of snapping away! They're gonna be my last memories of Warlingham, so they'd better be good ones, he he! I am so excited about next week, I can't wait! eveyrone I know has to write in my book, plus put their phone numbers and addresses and stuff! And I'm gonna get some of my faveourite teachers to write in there too, ha ha! So nothing too rude in their guys! And of course camera is coming in every day, to be put to good use! THink I should have a couple of good piccies from today at lunch, all of us girlies!  Anyway, tomorrow I am going to work, again! Then I will probably try a bit of revision in the evening. Sunday I;'m revising and then I've got a rehersal for a concert that I'm playing in next Sunday. Does anyone want to come? I know you probably all don't, but just in case you want to find out what I work my guts out for all the time, you can come along to All Saint's Church in Sanderstead at 3pm, Sunday 11th May to watch me play 1st in a sextet that I'm playing. But none of you lot will proably wanna come, but hey. LAst ever chance to see JoJo in a concert, ha ha! Other than that, not much, sounds sad but I'm really lookng forward to getting back on Tuesday so I can see eveyrbody and jump up and down with excitement and stuff! Lastly, are we gonna have a group photo at the ball? Or shall we just go in 2s or 3s? I don't think that we'll get eveyrone from our gruop in, so maybe it would be best to decide to go in 5s or summink? I dunno, I'll talk to donna see what she wants to do! Talk to y'all later guys

       ha ha ha yes. I think that verba; abuse was from me, in the form of "Tom you're a bastard!!!!", "fuck", "I bloody hate you" and "piss off". Needless to say, all those insults were when I was on a ride that scared the crap outta me, and Tom had lied to get me on there! So yeah, once again excuse the language but I feel it was justified!!!

       We had such a kewl time at Pork Farm today!  We got there, and I went on Collossus 3 times, Nemesis 5 times, and Quantum 4 times. Also went on rapids, loggers leap, stampede, detonator, tidal wave.  The journey home was HILARIOUS! We were taking the piss outta richard, and we found a dumped babies pram in the bin, so we pulled it out and, um, well....used it.  As shown here....Honestly, I really wish I had my vid cam.......

       WE GOT STARTED ON! Basically we were sitting on the bus and there wioz this lairy girl on there. I was supposedly staring at her so he told me fuck off ect... Me being me, i rolled my eyes at her and muttered whateva under my breathe. She then goes " Dont talk about me bitch or i will knock you out, so once again i rolled my eyes and said "ok". Then the girl shut up and us lot carried on talking. The girl moved forward though and started listwening to our convo. We started talking bout tom and thorpe park. She then comes out with: Is that Tom going out with a girl called amy. So i replied no not likely. Then she started having a go at me cause of the way i said it! Us lot continued talking and then she came out with: Dont talk about me so i replied erm i wasnt! then she went on bout how she was gonna knock me out so Darren started laughing, then she started having a go at him ect... Then she shut up and wee continued talking until mine and darren stop, as we went to get off the bus she said: Don't even try looking at me or i will get off and beat the shit outta you. So Nicki decided to get offf the bus with me and darren! The whole time she was talking in a black persons voice thinking she woz well hard. Grrr i really hate peeps like that, she is such a hoe! thats it.

I hope you get a smashing tan on your holiday, its nice to have a tan, it makes you feel generally better about yourself. Oh, and I will give you my address when I next see you if you don't have the full one already. That is if you even want mine!  Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy!  wa? Can you flesh that out a bit please..... Glad you guys had fun at the concert :) I was listening to my sisters Bon Jovi album and it is pretty good. I prefer Bryan Adams though.  Bless you Max you really are obsessed. Posting on ere at 3 in the morning. Outrageous. Do you not sleep? Well today I am doing sod all so if anyone wants to go to the park to sunbathe and generally just mill about down there contact me before 1. LOL.

       Nothing can beat the tan I have on my waist :D Ok, ok, odd place, but its natrual and it kinda fades as it goes up my body. :S strange. Oh well, Nic likes it, lol.  There is a section of carpet in my room which STRONGLY smells of cheese, its awful. So, I went downstairs and under the sink was this Febreeze stuff (u must of heard of it on TV), so I thought I would give it a try. I sprayed it on, and the smell has gone all round the house. I now have a headache because of the strong Febreeze smell. I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH IT TONIGHT, ITS RIGHT BY MY BED :@ I would need Nic in bed with me to take my mind off it :D  Talking of Nic...   :D  P.S: That first picture of nic is the desktop background on my laptop :D

       I don't miss any science experiments cause they were always rubbish and most of the time we did them wrong ne way! And yes i admit i did the hands on bit except if it was to do with water and then i ended up having water fights with andy and max and getting shouted at by either micheele or Nicki to come and help! Oh the joys of science. I believe that pigs cannot fly as: 1. They have no wings 2. They are fat 3. they are useless 4. they just can't okay? Now i think i have eaten my dinner too quickly as i now have a rather annoying stomach ache which is pissing me off, maybe i just need the toilet??? LOL, jokes. No i don't i only went 10 mins ago! Now i am making an effort today to write as long blog as usually mine are really short and boring and i'm sure none of you guys/ gals read it cause i always seem to write about the same things! I would just like to say that i am really excited about Thorpe park and i can't wait to go on collosus and Nemises inferno... Again! I am also looking forward to my holiday as it will be great fun and i will come back with a smashing tan to put you all to shame! hehe. The only thing i'm not looking forward to is WAXING me legs ect... Cause you know i have to have beautiful legs cause i dont wanna be walking around all stubberly and looking like a man wearing a bikini/ swim suit. Now i would like to know your adresses so that just in case i decide to send a  postcard i can send one to you lot, usually i dont send postcards but i thought i would try something new this year! hmmm... What else can i write about? Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy! But i wont cause that is just boring. Now me i like the boy that was wearing the top with no arms, he had a sexy look to him, although i know for a fact he wouldnt look at me twice! Now i would like to say school sucks and that i hate it, but me being silly i am going back to take some stupid subjects then i'm gonna be even more stupid and then go to Uni. Although i havent decided on that yet as i dont know what i wanna do. That makes it slightly difficult when choosing courses and stuff. Now by now i should think your all thouraghlly bored stiff from reading the crap i have writeen above so i will sign off here!  Goodbye

       Hmm. Well as much as I need to get a job really I can't this summer because I will keep asking for days off here and there for that U-Project trip I am on. So I would probably get sacked within....2 weeks? Well I will def get a job towards the end of the summer/begining of sixth form because that is when all the Uni folk will quit their jobs as they head off to uni and their holidays with their friends. Hmm, this shall be interesting because what I am actually do right now is just typing so I can see if people actually read the posts on here. So I am going to ask and say random things, I will only know if you have read it by you mentioning it so lets have a lookie and see where this experiment goes. Speaking of experiments does anyone miss science experiments? I know in our set 1 class they could sometimes be hard but I thought our was of actually doing them was funny. Geting in one large group of 7 rather than the 3/4 we were supposed to be in...LOL. Then of course everyone has their own jobs. ie: I would take results, Max would time, Andy would refill the acid of whatever, Jackie always did the hands on part. It worked and made it fun. Hmm...can pigs fly? That's a scientific question. For my birthday this year I want to do something crazy...yes...I want to go horse riding! Woo! I have never been before and I think it would be a laugh. Hmm..I wonder if they have any jobs going at the nearby stables. That would be great. Working with horses. Ok ok, so it'd be mucking out but hey, its stil work and its physical work so it would look good to any future employers. Wahey! Sorted. I think. Moose.

       The 6th form induction days were ok. I took on that day ICT, AVCE Business, Media Studies, Design Tech. Then we left for daves at the beginning of 5th lesson for a sleepover. That was great fun; we dragged the dancemat, PS2, TV, DVD's, laptop and some other stuff downstairs to muck around with. In the morning, I got up and went down to the newsagent to get a copy of PCZONE UK, which has previews of Max Payne 2! Yay!  On my way home from Daves (I has to walk from Selsdon to Caterham) I thought to myself "Ah, I bet im gonna see somebody I know walking down Limpsfield Road, I bet it'll be Robert". Sod's law came into play; so yes, I saw Rob with his boyfriend walking down Limpsfield Road. At the bus stop just before I saw Rob, I thought I saw Nicki.J at the bus stop, and as my eyesight isn't very good, I couldnt make out who the person was, but I thought it was Nic. It turned out to be Robs mum! :-/  Hey! I walked through the park today on my way home! It was about 12:00 ish. When did you lot get there?  I can't resist posting this: (Sorry Nic!) :D    YUMMY!!!   My plan of the week: Saturday - Cry because Nic is going away for the whole week. Sunday - Nothing. Monday - Thorpe Park. Tuesday - Nothing. Wednesday - Nothing. Thurdsay - Nothing. Friday - Cry because i'm so happy Nic is coming home! :D Saturday - Talk to Nic. Sunday - Go to park with Nic!!!!! YAY!!!!!!

       Well guys! Won't be here for a while so I'm apologising in advance Nicki! Won't be around at all tomorrow, might make it Sunday morning, but after that I won't be around until WEdnesday night or possibly thursday due to my hectic schedule! Anyays, Gimmie something for the pain, gimmmie something for BLUEEEES, gimmie me somethig for the pain that I feel when I'm hanging on a hangman's nooooose, gimmie something for the pain, gimmie something I can usseeeee, can't remember the rest! oh no! Back to the CD! I'm listening to the White Stripes "Elephant" at the moment, it's really good! 'Seven Nation Army' is wicked, but there are some really good acoustic tracks on it too, I would think that Max and Nicki would proably like it, not sure whether Tom and Jackie would though?! Anyways......... Hmmmm. Cinema was good last night, 'Bruce Almighty' wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be, actually had me laughing quite a lot! Anyways, lolooking forwa rd to BonJovi soooooo much! I Can't describe how mcuh! Plus thorpe park too, h eh ehh e! Bye now, gtg to work!

       Today - park (hopefully but it looks like its gonna rain, grrr) Saturday - nothing Sunday - nothing Monday - nothing Tuseday - Keanu Film Day with Ashleigh Wednesday - Thorpe park! Thursday - nothing Friday - nothing. And that is next week planned out. Go me and my brilliant social life!  I thought yesterdays taser lessons were interesting. I am loking forward to the art and textiles courses although I was not impressed with the textiles taser. I mean, it was like being in a taster lesson for year 7. I sat there and weaved for 30 minutes. I mean, aaargh! Its so feminine! And sterotypical of women! Yes yes, I know its hard for the teachers to do taster lessons but still. And they were doing that typical thing teachers do "Oh how lovely!" next person "That looks nice!" next person "I like that colour". Argh! They don't actually mean the compliments!!!!!! EEEEEEEEEE! But anyways, histroy was amusing. Westy couldn't spell my name right, he did Nicky, Nickee and Nickie. Duh. NICKI. Geology was well, chaos because I had no idea what to do and felt stupid all over again so here we go back into the same old science routine of me being dumb. Art taster was great, I produced a nice chalk and charcol shell whcih I am rather pleased with and Miss Starky seemed to like it as well. English Lit I am really looking forward to. War literature and all. Engjoyed that. Amusing lesson.

       Well well, what a busy girl I am! Did practically nothign all day apart frmo go out for my nan's birthday lunch, and read HP all avo! However, tomorrow I'm booked in to read all morning (lol!), working from 12.30 till 4.30, going to a rehersal at 4.35 until 6pm, and then going to Michelle's house for a 'groupie' until 11pm! Wow! Then I need to be at work by 9am Saturday until 12.30 when I will depart so I can get a train to be in London by 2.30, ready to run in the gates of Hyde Park at 4pm, and screaming at BonJovi support acts by 7.30, then hollering at THE BonJovi by about 9-9.30ish! Wow! Then home by about 1ish, hopefully. Sholudn't be too late. Then I'm waitressing Sunday afternoon, 2 till 11pm i think, who knows with the lifestyle I'm leading at the moment?!!! At least I get paid. Oh yes, then Monday Thorpe Park. Oh and Tuesday rehersal at 12.30 till 1.30, shopping until 3pm, then back to school for another rehersal at 3.30. WEdnesday I've got an induction day at Oxted so I have to be out of the house by 7.45 in order to get the 8am train to Oxted! Then I probably won't be back before 5pm! Yay! Thursday I'm working all day for my dad. Friday I've actually got a day to relax, providing I'm not called into work! Woweeeeeeeeee I'm going to be exhausted! Anyways, how were the taster lessons today? Can't have been any more boring than my day, mind you! I'd like to know how Tom's unplanned history lesson went, lol! Nicki, what was art-textiles like? And how many external students got lost, ha ha?! Anyway, Tom I am coming to the rehersal tomorrow but late as I said earlier, I phoned Mrs Hicks (aren't I good!) to let her know, just so she doesn't have my head off when I finally arrive! Anyway gtg now, toooooodles!

I feel sorry for the external students, they won't know where half the rooms are! Bless! Slight panic last night. The fire alarm went off!! But there was no fire. So I am knackered now for wondering what the hell was going on. Hey, at least we know it will wake us up if there was an actualy fire.

       Well hello guys. I don't actually know why I'm saying hello though, seeings as you're all at school for your induction day, in which case: hope it's going/went well! I've just got back from my mum's work- I went to see if Harry Potter was delivered but it wasn't; so I've come back annoyed and I'm now munching through a box oc chocolates to make me feel better, lol. Probably just end up feeling sick. Oh well! Anywho, weather looks a bit grim today, cloudy, threatening to rain, and where I am it smells like a bonfire, yet again! Yuck mocha. *bins current chocolate* I dunno what to do now. I was hoping to read hp, but it isnt here so I'm annoyed, as previously stated. I suppose there's always the tennis to watch, but the minute I turn on the tv it'll start raining in wimbledon and they'll have to abandon play, it always happens when I sit down to watch! Anyway we know what'll happen: One of the Williams sisters will win the ladies, Tin Henman will do a dramatic crash out in the quater finals, and some obscure russian will win. Probably. well like I said, hope everything went ok today, I can't wait for my indcutvion day next week, hopefully it'll be good! talk yo y'all later now

       Aww, sorry your Alton Towers trip has gone wrony. Maybe in that summer between collage and uni you guys can actually go for a weekend? Stay in a hotel and all that jazz. Jenny has a birthday on 7th August which I am not here for because of my summer trip. I get to go go-karting! Yippe! Proper helmets and all! Yes I agree Tom, they don't realise how lucky they are. Even if their birthday is in the summer most people are free to go to the cinema or something. Birthdays in Decemember just don't work well. But i am used to it now so I don't bother with my birthday anymore. Its pointless so no need to make a fuss. As much as I would like a surpise party or something it just wouldn't happen. What is everyones plans for the summer then? The induction days are on wed and thurs. Tomorrow I am going shopping in London with my sister. At some point father and I will be going to the war & peace show which I can't wait for. Tom and I have 2 trips planned which should be a blast. Jackie and I will be off to Thorpe Park next week with Ben and Si, yay! That is about it.

       One of the best things was too see everybody so relaxed! No more exam stress, just chilling out. So thanks Jo. Unfortunatly Railtrack or Network Rail or whatever on earth our train network is called at the moment, have moved a few stations around and in the doing so, they moved the train that goes to Alton Towers. So now, not only is the journey longer, but we get less time in the park, and they put the price up! The cheek of it! There is a big difference between 33 and 38 for a day out. So I'm giving cheques/cash back to people because I don't think it's really worth it any more. Grrrrrrrr. Flipping trains. The next birthday I believe is Jackies? 23rd or 24th of July? Followed by Max's on the 23rd or 24th of August. All these people with nice summer birthdays! Lucky things you are. Don't know how good they've got it, do they Nicki? ;)

       This is a celebrity blog as I am blogging from Andy's house! We taking part in the Warlingham Fate tomorrow and our Brazil team have a stall there. We have crockery and a few bits and bods to throw balls at. Hopefully get a load of money to help towards our trip. The ICT exam was pretty much as expected, only one question got me was "Name four features of the 1998 Data Protection Act" which I could not remember at all, but never mind. After talking to Barry, I am on the C/B border. That's it! All over! No more exams, and now a nice relaxing extra long summer to look forward to. Andy is watching every word I type, so I better not let out too many secrets, hehe. Looking forward to what should be a very interesting party tomorrow!

       Hi Hi Hi. Well today I accompanied my friend Sarah job hunting, she's so fussy though! She can't work saturdays cos she dances, she can't do after school because she dances, so basically she wants a holiday job that lets her leave at 3.30 everyday, and no weekends. hmmm. We started off in Hamsey Green, but no luck their, just a lot of application forms. We then walked down to sanderstead and we thought we'd got osme luck cos there was s sign in the bakers, but they said they'd already filled it, they just hadn't bothered to take the sign down! So no luck in the rest of the shops in Sanderstead, so we hopped on a bus into Croydon. Clarks said they take on holiday people which was good so we collected a form, and Clintons had a vacancy but it included a Saturday, so no luck. every other shop (Marks, BHS, Alders, HMV, Virgin, Waterstones etc etc) said they haven't got any vacancies till August/October/Christmas. Fun. So we then walked out of Croydon along the Brighton Road to go to 2 music shops, and no luck either! Collapsed into a bus stop on the Brighton Road, looked up and saw a restaurant had a sign in the window advertising for waiters/waitresses, so we went in as a last resort, cos she could do that as it would be evenings! The people in there were so nice and I got a free drink while I waited for her so I was happy after a long day! She got a trial, and then the bloke told me I could aswell! So we're both trainee Waitresses now, lol! Very strange day. Went all round the world, ended up with a job I didn't know I wanted, and then spent the rest of the afternoon in Selsdon Primary photocopying log books from 1955.  Can't be assed to go to IT cos I went yesterday and it was pants, so I'm going to do some revision of my own. Perhaps. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?!

       Well hello people. What a bizarre day it was yesterday weather-wise! Sunny and warm in the morning, but by the time I got off the tube in London, it was chucking it down! Then, when I came out of a shop, it was beautifully sunny again! Fortunately my friend and I avoided all the rain, because we decided to get a bus back to Victoria instead of the tube, cos we couldn't acutlly find a tube station and we didn't fancy getting wet! The bus was quite odd, we got a seat so it was the first time we'd sat down all day, and it was some dodgy old bus that took us practically half way round london on it's way to victoria, but at least we got to see some nice places, lol!  Today the weather is beautifully sunny again (although it's quite windy), which  is a damn good job too, cos I'm going to be out and about again today! The only problem is the wind, so I'll have to go and do a wind test with my clothes- put on one outfit, stand in the garden for five minutes and see how cold I get, then change to the next outfit and so on until I get a combination that I'm happy and warm in, lol! Anyone else have any strange methods of deciding what to wear?  Anyway, must go because my hair is an absolute mess and I've got to deal with it pronto! Have fun at the park (whoever's going!) and I'll probbaly talk to some of you lot later! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

       Ok Jo. Fair enough.  Today I am going into Croydon with Jackie because we both have some shopping to do. So that should be a good laugh. I never did go to the garden centre because I went to Jackie's house instead and went on her dance mat. I cannot do it at all!!! I get all confuzzeled. While I was doing the lessons Jackie was whooping at some kids in their paddling pool. Hmm. Anyone guess what Jackie will be when she is older...... LOL. Jokes.

       What lucky folk you are.  I have been having a bit of a bad weekend to say the least. But I will discuss that in a mo. First of all tomorrow I have a textiles exam. Woppe. In the afternoon I am going to the garden centre with father because I need to get a proper cactus house for my cactuses because after 3 years of neglect they are alive! So now I intend to keep them all nice and healthy. Tuseday I am going to Croydon with Jackie to get Jo's pressies. I am also intending to but myself a few CD's and some matrix posters....hehe. Wednesday we should have the park. Loads of people haven't emailed me back on whether they are coming or not yet. Grrr. So spread the word people. Thursday I am not sure what I am doing. Friday is the day of reckoning with the Information Communications Technology test. Sorry, I think it sounds so much better athn ICT or IT. LOL. Today I have been reading on of my books. Did you do in WHSmith you can get any 2 books for ust 10? That is a good deal, and they have some good books on the shelves too!  So my dilemea. I have the sixth form letter. And guess what. I have subjects that clash. Wopee. But then guess what. The 2 subjects which clash are the 2 subjects I reeeeally need to do for my future career. Grrr. I wouldn't care so much if I had to drop Geology or English lit but I have to choose between HISTORY and ART/TEXTILES. HOW THE HELL DOES THE FLIPPING SIXTH FORM EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? I MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE COURSES!!!!!!!!!! I will be on a rampage tomorrow as I must go and complain to Miss H then to Mr V. Anyone care to join me? Grrr.

       Grrrr, i hate my computer. Well i went to Croydon today, the main reason was cause my sister forgot to take the photo chip with her to wokr this morning, so i went in and gave it to her. The most surprising thing was that she then payed for my bus fairs and ALSO brought me lunch !!! I then went on to buy myself some nice shorts for which i am wearing now and a top, which on the back has written: kik my arse, or something to that effect. I have also sunbathed today although not for too long as it was a bit too hot unless it weent hazy! Ne way enough said by mee, until the next time i blog...

       Today I have done nothing apart from get up, eat, and turn my hair a bizarre colour. Other than that I've been relaxing in the garden, now a small matter of exams is out of the way (well, apart from that thing called IT that I really don't intend to revise for!). Got quite a busy week planned, what with heart scans, day trips, revision classes and birthday parties all in the mix, but I'm looking forward to it because I only have to step onto the school premises for one occasion next week, and that would be the thing they call  IT, yet again. But gtg dry my hair now, and hope it hasn't turned green, cos it sure smells mighty funny at this moment in time. Toodles peeps

I also managed to get a top for Jo's party but the only problem with it is that I have to get someone else to tie it up at the back. Lol. So no one better un-do it. Grrr. I also brought some fish net tights! Again LOL. And I got some hair straighters which are cool because yes, they actually work! Wooo! What a really nice day it is today. Who wants to go down the park next week? So long as it is hot that is. I am thinking Wednesday. Tell me what you think.

       Grrrr, im a tiger! Well in my head maybe? I'm kinda bored at the moment, there is nothing to do anymore unless you have bucket loads of cash to randomly spend, and even if you have bucket loads of cash you still can't go out cause your mates havent got any money! You just can't win these days.  Well i have a very weird dream last night and it involved Ben Webb, i won't go into too much detail, but he was in jail in the peodofile unit and i was in a seperate bit but aslo in jail! Unfortuantly i woke up so i can't remember much more than that. All i know is that it was quite weird. I don't even know why we were in jail! grrrr. Well later on today i am going into Croydon with Darren to get a Father's day present for my Father and hopefully i am going to get Jo's present also, But i might just not bother getting Jo anything. ( I hate her) Nah i'm jokin, it all depends on whether i can find what i am looking for! Today looks like it is gonna be good, hopefully i can top up my tan so that when i go on holiday i will already be tanned and people will think i have be there for ages already! Lol. Well thats all i can think to write about at this time so i will sign off! GOODBYE

       Goodness me! Goff is still on MSN Messenger! Dear oh dear. History. I'm not really sure. I'm pretty confident I got at least a C for paper 2, because I was very revised up on that (thanks Jo!) but paper 1, I'm not sure I did very well at all on, like everybody else. So I really am on the C/D border for that. Not particually happy, but hey, either that or go live in a ditch. Yes! That's it, exams are over apart from some random ICT paper. All done and dusted. So now is the time to start planning the summer, and then at the end of the summer think about all the things you were going to do but never did because you spent your whole time going to parites or recovering from parties. My back really hurts now because the chair I was sitting in for all 1 hour and 45 minutes of that extra tireing Austria rehersal was all bent in the middle, so I couldn't sit up straight at all! Felt like somebody was poking me the whole time. Maybe it wasn't my chair and David was just being kinky. Hehe. Kinky sailors - why weren't hey in the history paper? One of my primary school buddies who I see every month-or-two was over this evening with her family, always good to talk about the good old days. Sort of miss them, but they were all snobs apart from a few of us. All at Trinity and other posh schools now. Don't care about us lot no more.  Jo - remind me about seeing her because she said something really nice you want to hear!  They have moved the 6th form timetable around a bit since I last saw it. So I am doing AVCE Media, Business & Economics and Geography. The plan is to do ICT, but I don't really fancy it, it's just the only thing I'm actually any good at. But it's either that or something else from 12B and 12D. Grrrr. I'll shut up now. One too many Cokes and a whole lot of ice cream!

       I had a veyr nice day thanks, sat in the sunshine and revised with Tom all afternoon. Thankfully the history exam today was a lot easier than the first one, uuuurgh. After the exam I got the bus into croydon with michelle cos I was supposed to be meeting my friend Sarah but Michelle ended up tagging along, and what an amusing day it was! Michelle made it her policy to try on the most ridiculous outfit in every shop, and boy did we laugh a lot! Quite a bit of a relief after the exams, and I'm happier now cos I know that Sarah is going to get on with my friends at ma party! yay! A week to go, h ehe! Gtg, I've just dropped ice cream on me keyboard so I bette clear it up! Be!

       I am 16 too. I have been so for 5 months (I think..is June the fifth month?) and 13 days. Welcome to the club Jo. I hoep you had a lovely day and I will give you your present at your party. Which I am looking forward to greatly. I have a skirt. Which is like a belt. Heehee.  The history exam was ok I thought. It went well. I have noticed something rather amusing in the history exams. Everyone does it including me. On each question no one just sits there and writes it all. Everyone tends to just sit there and not write or anything while they try and figure the question out. Its actually quite funny to watch. All these students with papaers open, only about 20 mins into the exam staring into space. LOL. How amusing.  Could Tom and Max please blog.

       Well, what an utter load of b******s that history exam was. Weston and his bloody 'Only revise the beginning and the middle cos you don't have to do questions on the end' and then what happens, the whole friggin' lot is on the end. Dammit. Well, actually more than damn it, I am very upset and very peed off with history teachers right at this moment in time. DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT. and a whoel load more of 4 letter words. you know, I actually opened the paper, saw the question and said "shit". I was that annoyed and upset. Reall pissed off. sorry to keep going on about, but I've worked so hard and it's all been ruined.  Other than that, It think maths was ok but it was definetly harder than the first paper, but that wasn't really a suprise to me cos I was expecting a hard ppaer, lol!  not looking forward to french tomorrow, but at least it's the last one, then I only have two more exams to go! yay! Plus it's my birthday on thursday so I get a nice relaxing day with no exams!" yay!

       I get freaky dreams. They are even freakier when they are about people you know and love and something bad is happenng to them. That's really horrible, when you wake up in a sweat and crying cos it's so scary and it seems real. I hate those type of dreams. Anyway! Science this morning was okish, harder than the other exam but Mr Stickland succeeded in messing up my questions 4- the minute I had done it anbd turned the page he said "I#m sorry to say that we've just noticed a mistake in question 4" and i thought 'oh bloody hell, here we go' and then I had to re-write the whole of the quesiton and made a mess of it. 5 minutes later, "I'm sorry but we made a mistake, there  wasn't  a mistake in question 4. So I had to re-write the whole bloody thing again, except I was out of space cos I had already written it twice. Honestly. Flamin' teachers. Right now I need some food. Marmite on toast followed by chocolate fingers sounds like a good idea.  Oh guys you will laugh so much when you see my birthyda cake, it's going to be so funny and soooo sickly!! he he he he!  Good luck in english everyone, although I'm sure no-one will need it cos you just make english up as y ou go along, being creative and arty-farty etc etc. Toooodles!

       I remember Umbongo, just not the song either. Just that it was hilariously funny. I had a freaky dream last night. The first bit was that Michelle didn't have a calaculator in the science exam today. Then this bit is to do with Jackie. It was  that day  in July and when the four of us got off the bus at  the destination  the other two circle of love members managed to rush off into  the lines  and we totally lost them. Hmm. It does not bode well hey? Well I am wetting myself about the science exam today. I will probablty be really depressed on my departure of the exam hall. Wopee. Althouogh I am looking forward to Thursday where Jackie and I will be shopping with the circle of love. That should be fun. Very fun. If you know what I mean Jackie. The group can bond. Heehee. Well, the internet is kinda boring lately although I have taken greatly to  urlLink faceparty.com . That is rather fun. I will also be getting my own domain in a few weeks which should be good.

Just been looking at all our family photos from when we were really young and stuff, quite funny cos I was the fattest little child with the most awful hair ever, and i was always covered in food! lol, not much's changed then! Well work today was fun, Tina bought her daughter Kinnou in who is three, and she is sooo sweet! She's got cerebal palsy which means she is quite backward (being brain damaged), she is very very tiny and she can't talk properly, but she is such a happy and cheeky child it is soo funny! She was driving Tina beserk today cos she was tripping up all the customers cos she's so small and doesn't register what's going on around her, and then having sung happy birthday to herself and been told off by a customer for making too much noise (jokinlgy), she ran round and round the shop screaming it at him, following him everywhere, and then stood in the doorway and screamed it a t him as he walked off up the road, then turned around and burst out laughing- she is soo cheeky cos she knows she's been naughty! Anyway, to keep her out of the customers' way I tried to get her to help me dust the shelves, by giving her all the products and getting her to line them up on the floor. This was fine for a while until she decided she wanted to help me take stuff off the shelves too, so I gave her the small stuff to do because she can't managed anything else. She was taking the little liquid ant killer tubes off the shelf, and dropping them down onto the floor, and then she stepped forawrd to try and rech the ones at the back, and trood on the reast of the ant liquid tubes, and they exploded everywhere, covering the floor, my trousers and her ickly feet in sticky ant killer stuff. Yuck. And what does she say? "oopsey" and smiles cheekily at me. Kids eh??!

       Maths annoyed me. There was a question about the mean number and all I could think of was the advert where that man goes 'can you spot the mean number' and one number takes an ice cream from the other then hits him. Dammit. I would've been so depressed last night if it weren't for lovely Jackie. 2nd July.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Jo's party. 21st June.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Party In The Park. Whenever that is......hehe. Then I was reading the email Si sent me aasking fi I did actually want to go to the cinema or was it just Jackie messing about. Hehe.

       Well maths! Yay! I am actually quite relieved now cos I was dreading maths, but then I found it easier than the mock and it seemed to be largely based on algebra, which I find ok! I didn't get twhat a box plot was though, only to be told by Dina that it is the same as a box and whisker!! doh!!  That's annoying, but it's only 3 marks and I sholdu have worked that one out anyway, lol! So yyeah, ii am ok with that. Tomorrow I have englsih in the morning and Geography in the afternoon, 3 and a half hours in total of essay writing- not quite my idea of fun!

       yeah. French was quite blugh too. Evil. And then we got our ball pictures back which cheered me up. However, the lady in pupil services tried to bite my head off, so that wasn't good. But yeah it's a really nice picture that we've got, yay! And I saw Nicki's and she looked fab, I didn't see the rest of people though! I've just got back from makros and ASDA. In makros we bought all manner of fizzy drinks and sweets for my party (including 600 marshmellows!!!), and then in ASDA we bought lots of crisps and stuff, so we now have everything we need for a party! yay! I even pursuaded mmu to buy me my own personal supply of alcopops! yay!  Anyway got to go cos my eye is giving me grief, hope maths goes okay for everyone (I'm gonna fail). Bye!

       Wisewoman hey?  Yes, two things you should know about the wisewoman, first she is a woman!  Ah ha.  And the second...  ...she is wise?  Yeah! Do you know her then?  No, just a wild stab in the dark, which incidently is what you'll be getting if you don't shut up and tell me where she is.  My holiday was lovely. Best bit was when we took a yacht, found a deserted bay and went swimming - fantastic! Piccies back on Thursday so I'll post a few at the weekend or somethin'. Exams: blugh. 'nuff said.

       Rah well I'm guessing this is going ot be my last post for a while, as I'm off to Spain tomorrow morning! Yay! I bet it rains for the whole journey down there though, which won't be very interesting seeings as we have to drive cos my dad is too stingy to pay out for air fares. But hey ho, that's life I guess. Um. Other than that, I haven't been doing much at all! Yesterday I went to CAterham to the dentist, and that was a bundle of laughs as usual. Then bought a book on M15 since the Cold War and the changing faces of espionage whcihc will take my mind off things when GCSE results are out. Um, fun. Yeah, life seems to be all doom and gloom atm, i'm sure it's not really, just through a teenager's eyes it is. Well I can't really thnk of anythign else to say cos my jammy dodgers are yelling ast me from inside my tummy (i think I ate too many in too short a space of time), and, um, just to say hi Jackie an dMax have a nice summer, Nicki hope u had fun on your trip thingy, and Tom don't forget to go to work! Bye!

       I went into town yesterday, and I bought me a cosmic  urlLink ColourSplash Flash . It's like a normal flash, but it flashes different colours, making the subjects in your photos come out in beautiful ab-normal colours. Cosmic stuff. I also bought a pretty cosmic hippy top to add to my new look. Deep red, with black and white patterns. I've got all my Austria photos etc back! This photo below is taken outside the Tate Modern. Read the bin.   I'll look though the others and post a few goodies later.

       Homesickness is a pain, 10 days into the Morocco trip and I was missing Nic. (And home of course; they dont call it homesickness for nothing).  Well today has been interesting. Went to the park with Nic and she got a lift back to her house at the end, which as you know is like 200m up the road. I got very upset, considering I had to ride 2.5km back to Caterham. Ah well, that took me exactly 6 minutes to complete the journey :D  Onto other things, I'm painting Nics bedroom tomorrow. Should be fun :) Whey! About a week ago I got my Wireless router. I can now rome my house on the laptop using the internet wirefree and not have my main computer on to do so. Merry Christmas folks.

        I smell like water lily and lavender.  I just went swimming and my dad brought with us water lily and lavender shower gell. Cosmic. The tour was not as good as Prague, probably something to do with the weather (or at least I can blame it on the weather). A very alone tour for me because I didn't have all that many people to talk to. When I wasn't pissing Jo and Donna off, or hanging around with the year 8/9s I was all by myself, which isn't fun for a week. So I got rather home sick, which I don't usualy get when I'm away. My photos come back in 3 days time, so I'll post 'em up then. I've text Nicki to see how she is, but no reply yet. Glad to be home.

       Raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah everybody, I'm home at long last. Austria was ok, not as good as Prague, hotel was horrible, food was yuck, trips were ok, hanging with friends was a laugh. Other than that, raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah and now I am extremely tired even htough I've had about 24 hours sleep since I got home at 7am yesterday morning. Raaaaaaaaaah. Anywho, just bought some vegetable curry from Somerfield so must go cook and munch before I start on packing (yes packing raaah cos I'm going away again on Friday raaaaaah). Raaaaaaaah. Ask Tom about week, he knows more than I do generally raaaaah.

I'll wear it, well the top half anyway, under my clothes in Cumbria so if I do get chucked in the lake or something I won't be too wet.  I'm bored. Minesweeper anyone?

       Well, it has been a somewhat interesting week. I'm having Nic round on Friday, and we r going out for a meal :) I also sprayed one of my PC's black:    The white bits on the case is dust. The type of spray paint I used makes the dust stick like shit to a blanket. Also, I have yet to spray the CD-ROM drive. As you can see, it has been removed.

We all got into teams of 5, our team was me, Helen, Pennie, Shelly and Ashley's girlfriend Stacy. We lost. But we had fun! I have two nice bruises on the inside of my knees now from where I kept hitting the steering wheel, painful but worth it! I drive like a man apparently. Hehe. You know, instead of going around the corners nice and slowly I rip around. Well, I try to. Lol. I didn't crash! Woo!

       hmmmm, What to write? Well, my holiday was good, it only rained once and that was for 3 minutes. Getting a sunbed was bloody stupid. Each morning my dad got up at about 6 to try and get a sunbed with an umbrella. Of course they had all already gone! So in the end he gave up and got up at 8 instead to get one without a umbrella. We visited Palma, the main town of Majorca, but it was an hour and a hlaf bus journey from where we staying! grrr. Our hotel was very nice, it had a big swimming pool, stage area, tennis courts, football courts, lots of shops, a burger bar, a pizzeria, a park, a volleyball bit and lots of bars. Also it was so close to the beach it took you about a minute to get onto the beach if you got out of the swimming pool! Erm... Didn't really meet anyone which was a bit annoying, but it didnt bother me too much as i was never bored. The simming pool had a slide! YAY I got my hair done again like last year. And the good thing was that it was 20 euros cheeper! Plus there were trampolines outside of the complex up the road so i was happy! I think i spent to much money on them though. well thats all i cant hink of to write at the mo so if u wat more details talk to me

       Cooooool, good for you Nicki! Very amusing picture Tom, you make me feel like an adolescent alocoholic. Ha ha, but it's only a bit of fun! OOoh still got to pack camera. Must remember that. Camera. Camera. Camera. Right! Um. Well work today was ok as per usual, nothing really exciting happened, and I didn't even get to do the trolley again (having been so chuffed with myself last week). But it was ok. Got a couple of good books from the library to take to Asutria, including George Orwell's "Animal Farm" which I hear is a historic read. Other than my toilteries and my lunch, I all set to go tomorrow! Should be fun, but I'm not really looking forward to a 24 hour coach journey now I know what it's like (havign done it for Prague). Well I sholud go cos I haven't got much else to say, I won't be back to next Monday probably. Then on the friday, I'm off again! yay! So have a good week y'all, and chat to ya when i get back (apart from Tom who is on the same trip, duh). Byeeeeeee guys! Oh Jackie hope you had a good holiday, tell me all about it when I get bcack!

       Wahey!  3500+ military vehicles on display, tanks, jeeps, ferrets, champs, weapons, explosions, living history reenactors, huge arena events, 1940s fashion, 1000+ stalls, world war two memorabilia, military models, 1940s history, fun fair and more!  Yesterday I rode on a tank, 5 which seems alot for a short ride but its well worth it! I have developed a new liking for tanks now. And Hummers. I love Hummers now. Hummers are basically like the jeep just ALOT bigger. You can see them in Black Hawk Down. This year they had a Iraqi tank there which drew a lot of interest. People come from all over to see the show, Dutch, French (pah!), German, even American! One day i hope to be involved somehow, maybe with my own vechiles. I wouldn't mind owning a  urlLink jeep  or  urlLink hummer  (big ol beasts!) when I'm older. Maybe ever a half track! Now  urlLink half tracks  really are nifty little things.

       Well well well. O to be an army brat hey? Spent the day at the War & Peace Show. Going again today. Got some 2 used combats, 2 for 10, not bad and today I will hopefully get the camo jacket to go with it (5) so I'm happy. I got to ride on a tank yesterday which was so much fun. The track was all bumpy and dirty and we were whizzing along I tells ya! That was my second tank ride so far, its worth it. I am eyeing up a job with tanks, the great beasts of a armored vechile!  Jackie comes back today or tomorrow. Not sure which but I'll be soooooooo happy when she comes on msn. I'll be all grinning and cheering.

       Hello guys. Long time no blog, etc etc. Well. Today Paul came round and we watched a film and then stuff, ya know?! Without wanting to go into too much detail, just letting you know what I'e done today. Seems the Great British summer is over all ready, it's been overcast, raining and windy all day, but I can see just an ickle bit of blue sky over there now?!  Oh no, just disappeared beind that big 'orrible cloud again. Ah well, we'll have to see what tomorrow brings I guess. um.  Tomorrow I am working from 12.30 till 4.30 which will get me some extra dosh, then working the usual hours on Saturday. Then Sunday- I'm off to Austria!!!! Yahooooooooooooo! I'm trying to pack at the moment but I'm having a bit of a crisis cos I can't find my little black vest top anywhere! Where the hell is it? I've turned my room, my sisters' rooms a=nd the bathroom upside down, still no sign of it!  I can't go without it! Other than that, I think I'm decided on what CDs to take, what clothes to take, I definetly need a hair drier, Thais bites and dried fruit, then after that I will bung in as many more clothes that will possibly fit! he he. Clarinet is not going in suitcase this year, I will just shove it in the hold on the coach, seeings as last time I wasted precious suitcase space by trying to get it in! Was so devestated when I found out I could have left it out and taken more clothes! Anywho, that is about it. My top 5 CDs for the trip are going to be "Jagged Little Pill" by Alanis Morisette, "New Jersey" and "Cross Roads" by Bon Jovi, "Idol Hits" by Billy Idol and "Meatloaf and friends" by various artists (duh). Top beauty product: Nail file. Best holiday book: yet to find it! Ah that reminds me- got to go and get one!!!

       I don't see the point in Sky subscriptions etc. It'll be shown on the BBC or somthing soon anyway. When I move house, i'm going to cancel the liscence subscription, I hardly watch any TV.  Lee and I have made our own office in Warlingham school! yay! Its a bit like the server room, only more organised. Currently Lee is making his custom made "Compaq" and I am writing this.

         urlLink What a twat.   This idiot says that there is nothing good on BBC and that they don't provide any good TV.  WHAT A LONELY WANKER.  I bet he curls up everynight with his Sky subscription and watches porn. Sad man.  Sorry but it matters to me.

       Ahhh, packing for holidays. Finding out how much of your walldrobe you can fit in your bag. Deciding which music to take, removing the ones you probably won't listen to, then put the whole lot in. Making lists of everything you are going to forget, and then forgetting it. Ah the joys.

       Brilliant Jo! Excellent news! What amusing pictures Tom. Very amusing! The park yesterday was allright. It was too hot to do too much. Lora and Darren dumped a bottle of water over me. How amusing.

       Cool, sounds wicked Nicki! How long is it for, and when?! Well, I've got four whole days left until I set off to Austria, which should be fun! howvere, I'm not looking forward to the concert side of things, a) because I am veyr unsure of the words in some songs (ummm!) and b) because I am apparently 'middle alto' so I have a little part all to myself (oh and Sally and the girl who can't sing), I can't hear either of them, my sister has deserted me, I didn't know I was supposed to be singing it until Friday, and um, I can't do it! Other than that it shoudl be fine. Oh apart from the small matter of Chango Mangos which I can't do either, me and bloody volunteering for solos. Ah yes, news flash: David T blatanly fancies Louise. PERVERT! Will explain when I see people; " just wanted to let you know your sister sang a solo, she was the better than everybody else there and I coludn't believe it was her". We all know what you're like David.......

        BLOG PEOPLE.  Yesterday I had my first meeting for the summer u-project. It was awesome! Everyone clicked right away, there weren't any little groups. We were all laughing and chatting and I am really looking forward to go-karting with them all on Sunday. We also learnt that for our trip to and fro Cumbria we have a  l u x o r y  coach! Woooo!

       The park wasn't too bad today. Dave D came down which was nice to see him again. It was all nice and hot. Good to see Pete, Jen and Nic after their holiday. Their pictures are really funny if anyone saw them. I miss Jackie. I hear Jo you are having a film day tomorrow. Have fun.

       Well I had a fun day at work, met the lady who has been on maternity leave, was quite interesting actually. Alpa has had a baby called Shey, and was covering for Tatuna today so she could take her kids out for the day (btw Tatuna is Tina's real name, I can see why she shortens it to Tina instead of Tuna). We got a lot of work done, and had a laugh at Alpa who couldn't remember a thing after 3 months off and swore quite a lot!!! Anyways! Tom has just accepted to do my job while i#'m on holiday, which proably means he'll get to meet Kinnou and Kishan, although kishan won't speak to anyone anyway, kinnou just throws herslef at random strangers!  Anywho, yes. hot day,. Lovelly. Got a headache. Marvellous. Fun. Mystery tour 14th September. Yay. Whaey. Must go. Alcohol. bye

       We need Jackie. She keeps everyone talking or rather posting. Plus her posts can be rather amusing. I miss Jackie.  Well, right then. Wednesday. Tom and I went on up to London and he has already said what we did. The guns you can move were great fun. My arms are all muscly now, lol. Well we kept pointing them at on coming boats and then following them as they went by which was great fun. It was great being a kiddie again. Hehe. The musems were interesting, well, what we saw. I think they will have to be made into proper day outs then we can actually do all the exhibits. Oh yea - Bow, stern, starboard and port. WAHEY! It wasn't that bad wandering around trying to find the photo shop. It was worth it. Its cute. hehe. And the lady was really nice. I liked her. Yay. So yesterday I did sod all. Today I went shopping in Bromly with my sister. Got some cheap clothes in the sales. Wahey! I have alos just figured out how to make my own CD!!!!! So far I have made a 'Rock On!! A Nikko Production.' album. Over the coming weeks I will make a party album and 'Nikko's Greatest Love Songs'. If you want copies you will have to give me a CD and I will make one. Hehe.  Um, what else. Max BLOG.  Park on Sunday should be good. Nic and Jen will be joining us for once. Wahey. One last note, you know you got a willing slave you just like to play the thought that you might misbehave but since I'm only dead to you I'm saying stay away. Get it?

       I haven't blogged for a while, so two days worth of blogging!  On  Wednesday  I dragged Nicki all the way round London.  In this order, or some variation of it, we... Went to the HMS Belfast and looked around that for a couple of hours. The coolest bit has to be these massive guns that you can move around and point at stuff, so we threatened boats on the river. I'm sure Nicki has some cool things to say about the boat. It really was pretty amazing. Nicki now knows all the parts of the boat, and what the different flags are called, hehe. Then we wondered down towards South Bank along the river side, up to the Tate Modern. Didn't go in, but just had a quick look. Then we got the tube all the way over to South Kensington (near Hyde Park) and had lunch in my favourite resturant. Then we looked around the Natural History Museum (the Life and Earth sections). Followed by a quick tour of the Science Museum. Then we went back into the city to Westminster and went to "the door" featured in Die Another Day the Bond movie. It's the one on the other side of the river to the Houses or Parilment where Bond goes to meet M in the underground station. Then we bought a ticket for a boat back to South Bank, but while we were waiting we went up to the London Eye to have a look. 5! Not bad, do that one day. Then we bought ice creams and went to watch protesters in Parliment Square. They where campaigning for the legalisation of canabis. One blokes sign said "Free the Weed". Then we had a lovely boat trip up the Thames to South Bank, where we went up into Farringdon where I got us lost for a few minutes looking for this tiny little photography shop. I found it in the end, although Nicki wasn't too impressed. How was I supose to know there where two post offices? Anyway, we went in there, and because I had rung the lady in the shop up asking how to get there, and after telling her our little story she gave us some free postcards. Then we joined the rest of London and got a train home.  Today  I did nothing.

       Well I really enjoyed PITP. It was a great day out minus those cheesy feet and the fact that I too got burnt. But once I got home I slapped on lots of after sun. The train on the way back was funny. LOL. All together now - hehe. Good laughs. Good memories and good memories is what is imporant.  I went to Ash's house last night and we spent 8 hours on the Nintendo playing Bomberman and stuff. Then we watched 4 films one of which was Not Another Teen Movie which is one of the funniest movies ever. It was a good laugh. I have now seen the Ali G film, I wasn't that impressed I have to say. Dirty Danicng is always good to watch and so is The Sixth Sense. So I went down the park today. I was not impressed. I got down there and no one was to be seen so I rang Helen and she said they were in the woods and she would come a find me in a mo seeing as I didn't know where they were. So I sat there and waited. And waited. No one came. So I rang / text again and I was told to 'come and find us, its a game' to which my reply came as 'no, I am not in the mood to piss about'. Still I waited. And you know what I am like when people ignore me or leave me alone so I walked back up the Dobbins and headed home. I met Lora on the way so I turned around and went back as it was a relatively nice day. Sure enough as Lora was there they came out and we sat around all day. Which I didn't mind seeing as I was / am tired. Oh, and its fun to the be the butt of everyones jokes and jibes. Thanks a lot. I miss Jackie.

       What really worried me was the fact that Pingu was the one suggesting I used voodoo. I'm not quite sure who is going to the park and who is not, all I know is that I'm not, partly because I'm sitting here. I know Nicki isn't going, and Jackie can't go for geography reasons. Jo is in school. So it's probably just Max then.

       What the............................? Random comments! Random comments! Anyway, I had a VERY interesting conversation last night, won't go into details but involved mu Pingu, and Tom mblatantly didn't like the fact that Pingu is getting more action than him cos Tom says he's going to put Pingu and  Tony Blair in a box together and practice Voodoo on them, which is a bit unfair for me, although I woulnd't care if he blew Tony Blair up, I wolud be veyr upset if he practiced Voodoo on my Pingu, so STAY OUTTA IT! Anyways enough of that, I'm going up to school later and I think I shall wear my very mini skirt, which means I need to go and paint my toe nails! Yay papmering time! yay! Anyways see y'all later dudes. Apart from Jackie who is on holiday. Bye!

          Replace cabage for something that sounds alike to froging   Which cabage idiot put cabage Heathrow airport all the cabage way over there?  Take an age to get from cabage Victoria to cabage Heathrow. Probably worth going all the cabage way to cabage Paddington and then paying another cabage 12 to get the cabage express all the way over cabage there. Just move cabage Heathrow into the middle of cabage London, job cabage done. Planes will probably get the caught in the cabage congestion zone and get charged a cabage fiver, and a couple of cabage speeding tickets. "Excuse me British Airways, but your vehicle was doing 350km/h" cabage Ken would probably say. Stupid cabage country.

       So you enjoyed it then Tom? I wasn't sure whether you were going to l ike it or not (seeings as u are a Moby fan etc etc), but I think you enjoyed it? PErhaps not quite so much as Bon Jovi, but after such a wicked concert anything would be hard to follow! And Nicki, I had a fab day with yo u and Helen and Tom, was a good group to go with, and I have a big bruise on my back from when u knocked me over taking my shoe off! But I had fun. Meatloaf was really good, I can live happily ever after now I've seen him do the full version of "Bat out of Hell" live, I felt a bit lonely tho cos nobody else knew all the words (well, apart form the old fogies!) but hey, I had fUN! I am very burnt though, and it is rather painful. My back is all prickly and so are my shoulders, and my face is quite a strange pinkish colour! Not a good look, especailly when wearing a red t-shirt, but I suppose it's my own fault really. Anyway! Yay! Probably come back alter.

WEll anyway Paul came round this morning and we chilled and listened to music, then I went to work and got myself covered in bathroom sealant, then I came home to change before the rehersal, and was feeling quite ill too, now I feel even worse, and I'm going back to bed cos my head is spinning. Have a very nice holiday Jackie, to Tom and Nicki- See you 8am Sunday, to Max, um, hello?!

Study in quiet rooms, get latestest sport results while cooking and many other things - but does my mother do something that sensbile? No, of course not. "Wireless internet? Does that mean I can play computer games in bed?" Mothers hey? Tut tut. Blog more later, she's just got onto Level 2 of Lego "Stack It"...

I am so tired from Thorpe Park though. I really am. But I really enjoyed it. Simon is a wimp. Haha. I am tired. At least I won't be bored over the next 2 weeks as Jackie is very kindly giving me her dance mat while she is away. O how I love Jackie. I am tired. The park tomorrow better be fun or I just won't bother so someone better come and mess about and not just sit there for the whoooooole four hours. I am tired. O look, I just looked at my msn list and 6 people are online but I didn't even notice because my brain won't function properly today. I am tired. My cats are so funny. One is asleep in the chair and one is in a box. How cute. I am tired.

A friend is coming over today and we are having Keanu Film Day. Hehe. Should be a laugh. What can I ramble about? Um, well I am watcing Laurel and Hardy and they are really funny. I have already today text Sikon (at 12.08) gone to bed, got up, showered, eaten and cleaned my room. I am now posting here and surfing the web until 11 when I shall meet my friend.

       I do say stuff, but i never do anything exciting or out of the ordinary so i have nothing to write, but i try and write something every day so people know that im alive and that i havent dropped dead! Okay so lemme think of some news.... Well on www.faceparty.com/crisppy i am officially rated a supermodel now! I have been a star for the past like year! So im really really happy although i dont like being a supermodel that much! On Monday i am going to Croydon to get some passport photos done for stupid school, although i have no one to go with, that doesnt bother me though as im only getting the photos done then going home again! It's a bit of a trip but there aint any photo machines around where i live! Then tuesday im enroling and then after that i should be going to the cinema with Nicki to see Hollywood Homicide, that should be good but i do hope that Nicki doesnt talk too much or i may have to beat her with a wooden stick. On wednesday i have a frigging hospital appointment and then Thursday it's back to the dreadding school. ERm thats about it really! Thats my life all written down in one paragraph! :( lol

       You don't say much, do you Jackie? Today at work Trig brought with him his fly swatting gun, like Andy has. He then turned into James Bond and bounced around the centre swatting flies and scaring children. I came across a fake pound coin today! Never seen one before, and the customer hadn't either, he was quite suprised! Other than Garf and Biscuit's attempt at wearing womens jackets and Alex wearing winter-wet-suits it was a pretty normal day, or as normal as it can get.

       Rah. I work for Tina atm but I think it is Alpa's husband that owns the shop, so what Alpa's baby Shay is old enough she will come back to work at the shop and share Saturday with Tina. Shrina and Shay are Alpa's kids, Kinnou and Kishan are Tina's kids, Kommel is Tina's niece and Bimmel is Tina's husband. I'm going to see Hollywood homicide t his avo with Paul! Yay! WE're going to the 5.40 viewing, just in case other people are thinking of coming today (probably not) but in case you do, I'll be there with Paul!

       Rah. Ii got introduced into the crAzy world of Shrina today. Shrina is 6 (apparently, after her telling me that she was 5, 8, 9, 73, 26, 16 et et etc.......) and Shay is 5 months today. Shay behaves 10 times better t han Shrina, plus there is the added benefit that Shay can't talk yet, doesn't make you do strange dances, doesn't try and make u sing, doesn't push you into the window while you're trying to do a display, doesn't climb up ladders.................

       Brighton yesterday was fabulas. Ema and I had a great time and I managed to find a new pair of baggy surf jeans so yay! Day before I went to Croydon with mum to get stationary. We were just outside the bag shop on the second floor and Pennie came over, with her mum. And then Tom joined us, with his mum! Heehee. How fabulas. I got some pictures from Andy's party which are amusing.

       Nicki, you really need to get out more. Jackie, there is a part-time position being advertised in the window of Lloyds chemist in Hamsey Green- I think that means you do after school work and the odd Saturday or something, just thought I'd tell ya! Anywho, I haven't got much to do today, meeting Paul later this afternoon and he's coming here for  the evening. Other than that trying to get a bit of work done, but not getting very far.

The two-toed tree toad tried to win The three-toed she-toad's heart, For the two-toed tree toad loved the ground That the three-toed tree toad trod. But the two-toed tree toad tried in vain. He couldn't please her whim. From her tree toad bower With her three-toed power The she-toad vetoed him.

       Evening. Great party last nite. (Of what I can remember). Sorry Tom, I couldnt do PWD on flashkit.com, I had sorta calmed down by the end of the night. I didnt throw up *cackle*. I didnt get one wink of sleep last night, and I did feel sick at about 6:30, so I took a Rennie in a desperate attempt to stop the sickness. It worked.

       Well yesterday I went to a party with some friends from Riddlesdown, but there defenition of party is more 'piss-up' than party. But anyway, it's really funny watching all theboys who get completely trashed then dance around madly to Electric Six and Led Zepplin. Extremely funny. I left about 11pm, but everybody else 'crashed' on the floor at Bennett's house over night, havign done a midnight raid on Tesco's with  "a spot of bush jumping", as Paul so delightfully put it. Anywho. Today I've been to Caterham and the library and stuff, got a supply of alchohol for Thursday (good or bad!), and got this wicked album out the library: "Ether Song" by Turin' Brakes, it's great! Also just discovering The Thrills and The Vines, they're pretty good tooooooooo! Thursday is drawing ever closer, trying to fill up my time to forget about it! I think I might take a trip into crodyon tomorrow to go to Beano's and get some more music, wander a bit, then I'm going to the cinema in the evening with Paul to see 'Pirates of the Carribean'. Yay! Tonight I am going out to a friend's house for a catch up, so no thinking about GCSEs! yay! Hmmmmmm! Just heard that Andy's party is hawaiin themed, so better go think about that one! ttyl guys!

       I went to Ikea today. My mother and I. I can not believe how long we waited for the stuff. All the larger stuff like wardrobes (what we were buying) has to be got for you via fork-lift-truck in the warehouse. 45 minutes we had to wait. 45 MINUTES! We left our trolleys, nothing had been paid for yet so we weren't worried, got in the car and went to Sainsburys. Got some food and a paper, went back, had a look at the art and pictures (I bought a picture of a rubber duck!) and then went back to the warehouse, read the paper for a few minutes and then finaly the stuff was given out. Not going back there for a while, at least a month.

        Welcome back Jo  I'd love to hear all about your holiday if you want to tell me about it. Yes thank you, I had a great time Cumbria. Thank you for remembering :) I'm not looking forward to Thursday either, I don't think our group is meeting up but I am sure we will all merge together when we are at the school. I haven't heard of any dinners or parties, or I haven't been invited. Guess I brought that on myself by not turning up to Daz's bbq. Oh my. How could I. I'm sorry but I am rather annoyed. People are a bit mad at me for not going. Fair enough. But how come its me they are mad at? How come when other people do the same thing its fine!? No getting annoyed at that person or whatever, just me. Grrr. I just can'tget it right can I? Perhaps I should disappear off the face of the earth and then perhaps people may miss me. Or maybe they will start to spread blame out rather than focus it on one person.  I understand that perhaps I have annoyed folk by talking about James, Jon, Leon and Ema alot but that is because  1) they are new and the novelty hasn't worn off yet 2) they don't place blame on me Its not everyone, only a few. But those few make me go all urgh and then I guess it can affect the ones who I love. If that makes sense. Yes I am in a badish mood. Why? Because my gorgeous new fabulas skate shoes decided that today when I walked up to Warlingham they were going to rip half the skin off my ankle which is not pleasant. I have also been shouted at 6 times today for the smallest things. So excuse me for having a moan.

       Never heard tru'er words, Nicki. I was shot in the neck at paintballing from point blank range: I still suffer from random concussion because of that. The scar is still there somewhere.

       Hi guys! I'm back! Nice to know tom missed me, ha ha! Anyway! Did y ahave a good time Nicki? I should probbably read all the blogs that I've missed, but to be honest I'm too tired to faff around with it! Holiday was great, I'll tell you all individually if ya want to know instead of boring all of you who don't want to know, but the basis was it was great, 40 degrees everyday, blah blah! Yeah. Um. I'm not really looking forward to Thursday (obviuosly), but I am in the aspect that we get to see all our friends together again, various people have organised parties and dinners and stuff which should be good! I was wondering if our gang are meeting up somewhere and all going up to school together, or whether that will be too stressful for some people? Let me know if anyone has, and I shall be there! Well got to go, mein vater is cooking me an omlete! Tah tah!"

       Fair enough Tom. I always miss everyone when they are on holiday, the funny thing is no one misses me! Weather they are on holiday or if I am. I can prove that by the large number of people who had forgotten that I had been away for that week. How..demoralising. Made me feel great. Ok Jackie, I will see you there then. I am wandering to the park today to see Ema, James was coming but he can't now as he is getting as level results and so has to go home to tell his Aunt and Uncle. I miss Ema, I was on the phone to her for ages last night! Twas rather amusing.

       Interesting link there Tom. Thans for that. I certainly had a good old chuckle. Yer, Daz is very lucky with that. I think I can come to the BBQ but only for a couple hours as it is A-level day so I tink have to be home for dinner or something. I dunno. I'll see. Jackie, perhaps I can come to your house first or knock for you as I go up to Darrens? Or will you be there early to help him set up? My next few days are as follows: Tomorrow: A-Level result day so going to park to meet James to find out what he got at AS Level. Then Daz's bbq. Friday: Can't remember. Probably nothing. Saturday: Nowt. Sunday: Nowt.  Wooooooooooo!

       Well, i have been round Darens house all day helping him out in garden ready for his BBQ, i even helped to clean his room! He has sooooo much Alcohol! And his mum payed for it all! She is even paying for food and stuff as well! He is sooo lucky in that respect. I think we may be going to see T3 on Friday but i'm not sure, i will have to ask Max when i next speak to him. I hope we do, but if we don't i will ak Darren to go with me instead just the 2 of us, cause we have wanted to see it for ages! Tsk Tsk, you computer could be seriously ill Nicki! Make sure you take it to the Healthcheck at PC World or you could be in serious trouble! lol I am so glad that the heat is finally leaving us, its an acceptable heat now, i can sleep at night now without sweating the bed down! Lol, Has anyone got ne thing planned for the rest of the week? And Tom heres a virtual hug from me also! :D  Make sure you get another one from me off MSN.

       I am back. Yay. Our norton was corrupted and blocked us from accessing everything but it works again now. Although if I disappear for a while its probably because my computer is sick. We haven't taken it in for its yearly healthcheck at PCWorld like we are supposed to. Oops.  Sorry, I thought you saw T3 on Monday when I did, just earlier. I saw it in the evening. Yes, shocking, I was in Croydon at 8pm! OMG! But Leon, Ema and James waited with me until I got on the bus which was nice. Like I said, I like having people all protective over me. Its nice.  Awww Tom. Have a virtual hug. I know, life is a bitch sometimes and its not fair when people are taken from us. I don't know to say that can help except that I have you in my thoughts.

       Well my foot still hurts, and after tomorrows little trip I'm going to be flat broke. My spots are not being nice, I look like a bloody lepoard or something. Nothing I do helps! I take tablets, I apply funny strange blue liquid after washing, I wipe clean with those pad thingys when ever I come home, but fuck it! Nothing seems to work! I'm being selfish perhaps? Maybe I am, probably am, after all I'm selfish know-it-all twat, arn't I? I think I know everything and I never shut up, do I? Well you're going to put up with me for the next minute or two. Why should I have nice clear skin like everybody else? I don't need to be like everybody else, I'm not a bloody sheep or something. Yep, that's it, I'm a selfish bugger and proud of it. I want clear skin, I want this, and I want that. All me, me, me, me. Is it really so hard!?!? Bullshit there is some all mighty god or what ever the hell people believe in. If there was, stuff like this wouldn't happen. Victor, who is my great-grand-cousin (long title, but he's close), has been ill for a last month and has just passed away in hospital. He was such a nice person, had a lovely family who are now spread all over Europe (6 children!), and he wasn't even that old. Can't believe it, and I don't want to believe it. How can somebody so nice die? Much rather the people who broke into my neighbors house and stole their car died, that would be much nicer. Bastards, they should be shot. Makes me so angry that people think they can get away with it. People so desperate and stupid that they have to resort to crime to get them out of their problems. Go to hell the lot of 'em. So I'm selfish for wanting my family to live as well maybe? I want him back, I want to say goodbye. Is that selfish as well? It's not you, it's me. Ah, fuck it, it's all pointless anyway...

       Would've blogged yesterday but I didn't get in until late!! Did you all enjoy T3? I did, I saw it with Ema, James and Leon in the evening once we had got back in from Camden. Its ok, I didn't like it all that much though. Camden yesterday was cool, I have never been before and I know I will be going there alot more often now. Hehe. I got a sum 41 hoodie for the winter. I like hoodies. They are so nice and waaaarm. I met Jon's twin yesterday. I really do look alike! I got a bit confuzzeled! I hope you are feeling better Tom and that the pain goes away soon!

       Awww bless yaz Tom. Well the park today shall be amusing what with the heat and poor air quality. I have a feeling it will be a case of just sitting there. I can't be assed to bring a rug today, takes too much effort carrying it up/down the hill.  I'm out tomorrow in London with my darlings. Hehe. Can't wait to see them all again. Even though I saw James yesterday. Argh. My brain can't handle the smog!

       On Thursday, Friday and today I've been doing Jo's job which is lots of fun. Still haven't quite got the hang of which order the garden pots go outside yet. I can take in the broom trolley without it going on the road. Tomorrow I'm doing my job (doing the afternoon shift, thank goodness). So I'm very tired, but I've just had a Reef on an empty stomach and seeing things in a new light, hehehe. Beep.

I may come down an hour or two latebecause I don't fancy wandering about at midday when its at its hottest. Hmm. I will decide tonight. Tom, you should be very impressed with me. I have entered a thought for every single day minus one on THINK. (Link above)  You and Max both forgot yesterday. Tutt tutt. I am the champion. LOL.

       You're not wrong Nicki, in America, it's the same movie, but it is rated R (people 17 and under require a parent or guadian to be present) because US censorship it rubbish. You can't show anything over there.

       One of my friends told me. Perhaps there are 2 versions because they do that sometimes. One is kinda uncut but I guess for the Terminator it would be total carnage. Who knows.

       Dammit Jackie! Why must you bring that up! LOL. Yer, good luck to you to. I am wetting myself about it. I think I will go up before 11 and be ready to get my results the moment they open up. I will then jump on my envelope, run home, open it, and cry. Yup. That's my plan. Nice pic of Nic Max. I don't think she'd be too impressed. Yesterday I had one of my group meetings, it was great. Lovely to see everyone again. Today is our last meeting so I am not too pleased but I am happy because Ema has invited me to a party and James and I have spoken on the phone for nearly 2 hours every night so far since we have been back. They love me! LOL.  I am in a bit of dilemma but that is something to be spoken about quietly.    HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY JENNY

       Have fun Jo! The Lake District is so much fun and camping up there is even better :) I am sure you will have a great time. I did when I went. Yes, the film was excellent, I too would like a sequal and I would like to be a vampire. I already have the eyes. Mwhahaha. 3 weeks at Sixth Form. Good bad? I'd say good. Its going well for me. I am really knackered this week from sixth form and work. Whenever I stay up late doing homework or something I have to get up early and never get a chance for a lay in. Right now I am aching so bad. :(  Have a nice weekend everyone.

       Well. What an interesting day. Had to take half my personal belongings into school today to pack into a barrell for D of E, and I just know I'm going to have forgotten to pack something really crucial. As it is I've forgotten plates and cuttlery (quite important!), so i'm gonna have to sit on it tomorrow in the mini-bus. So yes. I just hope that a) it doesn't rain, and b) it doesn't get too bloody cold!!! I think that the cold is going to be the worst bit, having to camp for 3 nights in the freezing cold lake district, with nothing but 5 layers of clothes, a sleeping bag and a lilo for warmth. Hey ho, gotta do these thigns to get places in this world, I guess! Sholud be a laugh though, I just can't help feeling a bit nervous cos we've got to capsize in the lake, and I hate deep water. However, we do get life jackets so it sholudn't be too scary................But I bet I end up in tears whatever happens! Hey ho, so gutys have a good weekend, be back on Tuesday! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

I enjoyed the chat Jackie, Sally, Matt and I had fourth lesson. It was just plain cute I reckons. Today was ok. Lessons were good. Art was hilarious as we had to draw ourselves with a continuous line without looking which was incredibly amusing. It rained! Wahoo! My cous sent some pictures of him and his wife from this wedding then went to. It was in Montanna and the pics are so nice. I'm happy. I'm content with my life. Its fine.

       Yay Jo! Yay Jackie! Who went park? Why? When? I went to the Royal Albert Hall today to the disney channel kids awards. I got a free disney hat if anyone wants it, I got 2. LOL. BUSTED were so awesome. I love BUSTED. I would go see them next year at Wembley but tickets are like 21.50 which is a bit stepp so I will just enter lots of competitions and see if I get in there that way, cos BUSTED are worth it. Oh the park. Yer. Haven't spoken to them yet. Who went in the end do we know? Yer so BUSTED were great and I love Matt Jay now, aka, MATTIE. Phor. Wahey. Start work tomorrow. Don't know when I am working yet so I don't want any of ya'll coming in trying to harass me on my first day. But you can come in to say hi if you wish. LOL.

       1)Maths cos I really enjoy it atm and it's interesting 2) Geography- I'm dropping it! yay!  3) Having so much freedom and being able to get involved in what I want, when I want! 4) Haven't come across it yet!    So yeah. Today has been one whirl-wind of a day, in all aspects. Busy, busy, what with Ofsted Inspectors lurking in corridors and stuff, plus I am trying to work out with my head of 6th form what to take up instead of geography, or whether to bother at all, so I've just phoned about 20 different unis to ask their advice, and I got to go and have a meeting with Mr Butterworth tomorrow morning to dicuss more.

       1) Um, kinda a mix of ICT and AVCE Business, they all have their good points. 2) Same again, except they have bad points. 3) Best thing.....free lessons!!! 4) Free lessons get boring...  WHO BROKE THAT BLOODY HI-FI IN THE COMMON ROOM! Sorry, im in the LRC right now and its boiling hot in here, maybe it because ive got a fleece on :D My parents are going away for three days on Tuesday! Whooo!!!

       my best subject is erm PE but thats only cause i get to do practicales! Worst lesson i sprobably psychology cause ms Ajit is a stupid woman who continually writes stuff on the borad and it gets kinda boring after like 10 mins! I woul agree with nicki bout the free periods but only cause u can laugh at peeps in lessons! i am quite anoyed that i only got 8 frees now rather than the 14 i started with! lol Worst thing bout 6th form is the ammount of work you get, i think it is unbeleivable you get sooooooo much. And if you have more than one teacher its even worse! Ahhhhhh help me with my homework i have like 6 peices to do and i am getting bored of it already! Well what colour do you guys reakon i should paint my new room now my sister has gone? I need to know by tonite though so my daddy can get the paint! LOL I cant wait to get in this room permentantly cause that way i will have sooo much room and space i wont know wot to do with it all! But i know for a fact i wont let my room get into a mess like vanessa did! You could only see the floor on good days or after she had supposedly cleaned up! Lol  Shes gone now and it still looks a mess cause she has left half of her stuff her! The whole room is covered in dust cause we havent been able to get to any of the surfaces for at least 2 years!  Wow this is a really long blog for me im used to writing like 10 words then signing off maybe im writing sucha a long blog to stall me from doing my homework! Hehe And i have one more thing to moan about, Nickki have you noticed how all the chairs seem to be dissappearing over to the "upper 6th side" and less of them sit that side ne way! plus they have the new chairs over their side and the pool table! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

       Ahhhhhhhh. Eat you aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive. Omg how annoying was that whole music argument earlier. I can't believe how rude the sixth form are, especially the upper sixth. They are supposed to be helping and welcoming us not attacking us!!!!! But anyway, we will get our way eventually. I had a goodish day today. Lessons were fine. Here is a small question thingy for everyone to do:  1) Best lesson/subject? Why? 2) Worst? 3) Best thing about Sixth Form? 4) Worst?  My anwsers: 1) Geology because we have such a laugh with Seward. For example I wore my top with the sticky letters and we wrote 'seward.com'. Then changed it to 'seward rocks' (get the joke there..geology...rocks) which was highly amusing. Then using seward rocks we were finding the anagrams of it. LOL.  2) Probably English with that lady teacher I have. Its boring. We all fall asleep. 3) Free periods. You can chill out in common room, go on computers, do work in libary, go to shops, do schol service. Its so cool because most others are in lessons. 4) The upper sixth being prats and not seeing people as much like Jackie.

But yes twas good. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Very nice seeing you Tom and Nicki! I have to meet Jenny, she sounds lovelly. Sounds perfect girlfriend material.

       Congratulations Jo :)  I agree Jackie. I disagree with Max. I would say something to Sheepy by he hasn't blogged in a while. Lol. Well I came online last night at 11.10PM. Shocking. I had been doing art and textiles since 8pm so I wanted a break. After I came offline at about 11.45PM I did a couple spider diagrams and then went to be. Got up at 8 this morning, added some more detail to all my 4 spider diagrams and then came on here. In a mo I will go and do my geology and english lit (essay and book talk prep!!) and then go off to Woolies for my job interview. O the excitment. Then of course tomorrow I am going to the CBBC Prom In The Park with Jo, Tom and Nancy which should be a laugh. Then its back to school, week one, school service, lessons, mad lunches, free periods, general studies (pah!).

I have read everyones blog since my last but I won't comment on them all as I can't remember what they all said!!  So far I am finding Sixth Form mang! There are only one or two aspects I am not liking but thats mainly teachers I'm not keen on. I love all the new folk we have in our ickle group. Jenni, JAMES....lol. Hush. I am looking forward to the geology trip we are organising for half term. We get 2 days off school which means we also get to miss the sponsered walk!!! Yea!!!  September 11th. R.I.P.

       WEll i had a good day cept that it nded in my having four peices of homwork to do! BY TMOR! (i did leave 2 peices form yesterday to do today) Erm that phot thing is stupid and took age, my legs were acheing after that, and boy my picture is gonna look like shit! Erm i would like to say Miss Shar is usless, she talks on bout nothing so we dont get any of the info we are ment to get and we always end up walking out of the classroom with her still yabbering on bout nothing! I had four frigging lessons today, i think General studies is gonna be a load of bollocks, if id wanted to take 5 subjects i woulda done! No one said nothing bout doing general studies wen we applied did they! Grrrrrrrr What a bloddy waste of time! And not to mention energy, i do hope we dont get homeowrk for that cause i got enuf already, that probably being cause i got a bout 13 teachers and im only doing 3 subjects! Which means with every teacher i get homework, but fortuantly it means that it doesnt have to be in for ages cause i dont have then again for like a week! I now how 3 fat text books to carry to skool everyday and not to mention the 3 folders i also have to bring to skool with all my work in, by the end of the year im gona have no arms left cause they will of dropped off! Wahey this is a long blog for me, i think its cause im in a  oaning mood and im taking a break form teh 4th peice of homework of the nite! I'm not used to this, back in the good ole days of yr 11 i could leave it till the last minute and srill have to time to eat a cake! But not now as each peice takes like an hour or more to do! I Cant cope and im saying this after only  4 days at school! lol Im sure ill ajust to the lifestyle, it sounds better than urs Jo, you seen to have mountains of homwork and hardly ne free periods! Mine have gone done to 11 now cause of stu[id general studies! I would like to apoliguise for my poor spelling and grammar but i cant be bothered to check through it and make sure it makes sence! Hehe im lazy! Well thats bout it from me, im off to continue my Health and Social Care homework in which i have to read a newspaper and then rite about it and challenge its contents!

       Whey! Our ICT lesson was cancelled by Mr Hanson himself because people were having their photos taken. (Namely me and Andy, standing almost at the back of the queue :D ). Throwing grapes at Tom and Dave, that was good as well. (It was Jenny.J who through the grape at Jenny - Tom I swear, lol!!!!). WHEY! only had 1 lesson today total, including the cancelled ICT lesson. SCHIZER. I havent done my ICT, maybe because I cant think of a project to do.

Well I've been working since I got home about 3.15 today, I literally finished 10 minutes ago, I've washed my hair, running a bath, going to dry my hair, then go online to chat to people until I feel that the time has come for me to retire to bed!  WEll today for homework I have had to write a piece on why Mussolini came to power, make notes on a chapter of geography on urbanisation, Research and do a piece on tides, learn the present tense in Spanish (regular an irregular), Do some french questions on a text then translate the whole of the text into English, 4 questions on Algorithms for Decision maths, and finally a whole exercise on manipulating surds (in the words of my teacher, "sounds vaguely obscene") for pure maths. Oh the joys! Well at least I am enjoying it atm!

       Good Jackie - you get to read a real newspaper rather than just rubbish about people who show off for a living, anyway... I'm tired. Way too much work. I can't believe it, a few years ago I stopped art, I thought that was the end of my colouring in days - but oh no, geography today, drawing maps. Green for land, blue for sea - logical you see. One step ahead of the game. Business & Economics as well, stuff about the shop Spar (private joke for Jo, SPPAAARRRRRRRRR!). More geography for the other one, Coombes. First media studies lesson today - very cool, looks like fun! Period 5 today quite a few people had a free and not many could be bothered to do any work at the end of the day, so sat in the common room. Tasha was having a conversation with Penny and Helen, and the whole room went quiet for some reason (you know what I mean, it just does) and all you could hear was Tasha saying "are we talking testicals?" Rather amusing I must say. Have you guys seen that stupid sign the upper sixth put up about us? First day in school and instantly we get blammed for the mess in the common room. No lower sixth went in the common room because they were all to scared of the upper sixth! Silly people. I think it's quite sweet the way the whole room has divided itself between upper and lower, straight down the middle. Poor Nicki still hasn't got her computer working yet, so she's probably reading this in school at lunch - hi Nicki!

Um yes. Well school is ok actually, I have a group of people I could call 'friends', probably more associates, but hey, I got to start somwhere. I'm still getting the 'oh let's all talk to the new girl and try to drag her into our clan' which isn't too bad, as everywhere I go people talk to me and yell hi across the corridors and stuff, which makes me feel liked so all's good atm.

       Food for poor ol' me as well!!!!! Yesterday was absolutely great. Not only did I get 30 for doing 5 mins maintenance/repair on someones PC, but I had a great night out too! Can't get any better than that. As my wallet has been 'topped-up' *smug* I can now afford my Only Fools And Horses DVD, Max Payne II (when it comes out in about a month) and I can also take Nic out for a classy meal when I get round to it one weekend. Corny. I have also done most of my homework so far. I'm hardly lagging which gets me in a happier mood :) P.S: BRAND new absolutemaxpayne.co.uk due for release in about 3 weeks (just before release, how convenient). Kinky.

       Oh dear. As some of you know I went to the BFI London IMAX cinema yesterday with Dave, Andy and Max to see The Matrix Reloaded. The movie was great! But, rather than finishing at about 9pm like we thought it would, it finished at 11pm. So after getting out of the cinema, into the station, getting some food for poor Andy, finding a train, then hanging around at Clapham Junction for 20 minutes to get to East Croydon I got home pretty close to 1am. If I fall asleep in the common room, just poke me or something.

       Well done Jackie. Can't believe the little amount of frees you have Jo. I have 14 I think. In fact period one tomorrow is free. Yay, Monday morning and I can sleep for an hour in the common room! I was not impressed on Friday. My Eng Lit lesson was crap, I nearly fell asleep. Its one of those teachers who talks in the same flat tones. AAAAAAH! Then I had a free so I did some school service. Then I had textiles which at the moment I hate. The teacher was treating uslike year 7's, don't talk when I am, don't talk you should be doing your work etc... She also said that when we bring in fabric we HAVE to share it, like if someone asks to use some of yours you give it to them. Nope. I'm not. I don't have much money so anything I buy I am using myself, they can go buy it themselves. I mean for textiles and art so far its already cost me 10 for the 4 sketch books. Outrageous. I don't see why I should supply the rest of the class with fabric.  Anyways, I still have one more piece of textiles to do so chal.

       Rah well would blog but I've got so much to do it's ridiculous- Geography research (what and as much as I want to do for general background info), history research on publish health in the 1750s, Spanish stuff (the easiest of the lot- learning numbers!), French essays to write on the summer holidays- yay! Hey ho, at least I'm enjoying school and I am making friends, I've even been invited to someone's birthday party- and she's only invited 25 people. I guess it's out of pity for the poor new girl, but hey! Who am I to complain?!! Got to get my costume sorted for that, but she's gonna tell me what the theme is on monday. Shoudl be interesting........ My other bit of news is that I'm going to audition for Cabaret with Chloe on Monday night! That should be an absolute hoot. I can't remember whether I said that yesterday or not, but tbh I am so tired I really can't remmeber! hey ho. Got all my files sorted, so I'm ready to be off Monday morning and straight into a full week! Fortunately I only have to carry a daily file as we're not allowed to take in our whole file for each subject, in case we lose it somewhere and then we'll basically fail our AS levels wihtout the notes, apparently. Anyway! That's about it for today, I shall give u an update as to whether I am going on the Gold D of E canoeing expedition in a few weeks time when I find out on Monday- Holly and I are going to bribe the leader into letting me join in!

       Glad you had a good day Jo and that you are making friends :) I agree with Jackie, wasn't worth 20, maybe 10 but not 20. I enjoyed yesterday, I thought that the purpose of it all did work. I know my form seem a lot more relaxed with each other. My tutor is Miss Wilkins. Great. I have in my form who I know and get along with well, Olly, Max, Matt (can't remember his second name) and Lee Reeves. Then there are Michelle and Lisa who obviously I know and all. It should be okay. I also have Charlie in my form and he is a good laugh so should work out fine. I can't see how the Sixth Form block will work at lunch what with the lower and upper sixth all in at once. That's gonna be crazy. New guy James, was a bit lost at lunch as he couldn't find people so I told him to come on over and eat with us. Then Tom took him and the new girl Jenny off to the shops. Bless them. Bless Tom.

       Today I had tutor this morning where some interesting discussions took place between a girl called Chloe and I- she was telling me all about her day at the REAding festival, each band that played in the main arena, which guys she fancies from various punk/rock bands, and all abotu her favourite george Orwell novels, aparently the best she has read was a crime solving thing from the point of view of a cat....... Anyway, she was quite cool and I ended up on duty with her at break time, guarding the main hall from little kiddies trying to vandalise anythign and everything. Turns out she doesn't like anyone else in our tutor group either, so I tink it's a safe bet that i'll be spending a lot of time with her in tutor activities. After lunch I had a geography lesson which was a bit boring but also quite bizarre- the teacher sat us down and explained the usual boring stuff, then said "here's the book cupboard, here's some paper, do something with it" and we were all kind like, 'uh???!' but then she said she wanted us to write notes around the subject of coast lines, ready for our field work trip which is like 4 weeks time! argh! That's then going to be our coursework which has to be done by 5th Novemeber, so it's all getting quite scary already! I also made a sort of buddy in geography called Amy, we shared the books around and helped each other out by swapping notes! how sad am I? I'm jsut desperate to make friends I guess! Anywho, last thing I had french and that was quite funny actually,the teacher I had today is like Mrs Mawer (Jackie will know!), but and english version and slightly less barmy. That was ok! According to Chloe and Garfunkel (? Who knows what his real name is, but Chloe called him Garfunkel) I have a good set of teachers, which includes the head of sixth form and the deputy head, both of which are quite cool. i've also been pursuaded to audition for the school production on Monday night....... CABARET! One MOnday night we all have to go along for 2 hours where we will be taught for a song and dance routine, and then we'll  havbe to go back on Wednesday and actually do the audition to a panel of, um, teachers I guess! Nayway should be a laugh and the 6th form always get heavily involved (so I am assured by various upper 6th and school council members), so what the hell? I'm going along with Chloe and her friends, so should be a laugh if that;s all. Looking forward to tomorrow, Chloe has promised to bring me in her Placebo albums for me to borrow..............

       Well I had an induction half-day at Oxted today, and I think it's going to be cool. We had a house meeting and my head of house is really nice (always a good start when u have friendly staff around), then we went to various sessions on how to think, revise and work efficiently, some of which was useful (but most wasn't!). Got chatting to quite a few people about things, generally it's cool and my tutor is nice, in all aspects!! ;) Anyway! Not got much else to say really. Tah tah

I don't want to know anybody else, the friends I have a lovely and the rest of our year are a bunch of twats. 200 of us paying 20 for one days 'fun' - you do the maths.

       lol fair enough! I've got a bit of a problem in that on my student card I've got one of the photos that we got done on the last day of school, and I'm in me warlingham uniform. That means everytime I have to show the damned thing on the train I'm probably gonna get mobbed by Oxted kids. It's weird thinking Oxted'#s my school now, and Warlingham's a thing of the past!

       I agree Tom. The odd fancy dress party like Andy sometimes has is fun and amusing because that is all it is, fancy dress and a party.  But anyway, if your trick or treating don't bother coming to my house because we never open our door to any person silly enough to knock on complete strangers houses.   I got back from Birmingham yesterday. It was cool. The uni is right in teh city centre so a five minute walk and there is the train station and many a shop. HUGE shopping centres there. I got some new clothes but I've run out of room so I need hangers and I need more drawers. Sorry about not blogging Jackie, I haven't had time. Harass Max. He hasn't said a word yet about Max Payne 2.

       I hate Halloween. It has strange routes that nobody is quite sure about, it's a bit of a famine in the 1840s in New England, USA. It's a bit of the Irish about a man called Jack who made a deal with the devil, making the Jack-o-lantern - used to be in a turnip but the USA decided it would be better to use pumpkins as there were more of them. Trick-or-treating comes from Celts and was actually to give food to the needy on 2nd November in return for giving prayers to the dead on their path to heaven. It is the Celtic New Year as the summer officaly ends, acording to the Celts in 5 BC. There really isn't much in it at all. I'm sorry to be the evil and unsprited one, but I refuse to be sucked into this. Children running around wearing stupid masks  threatening  people to give them sweets which are going to make them fat. Old people have a terrible time and every year you read about an old lady somewhere going to hospital or having her house attacked. I don't care how great it is to dress up and run around looking silly, you can do that any day of the week in my house and get away with it, come on round, it will be a ball.

Or Stepdad. or Family friend. 9. what 10. because our brains are dumb and are not photographic enough 11. what are you on about 12. 9 13. lonely. keanu no. its, aaaaaaaaaaaah! I have no bloody idea! 14. inside blaines head  15. how are you.  Right now all I have to say is: life can keanu off and keanu annoy some other poor keanu soul.

       Concorde stops flying on Friday :(  Nicki got Picture 2 correct first (probably because she sent the e-mail at 7:30am that day) Max got both the pictures correct, but Picture 2 after Nicki. Jo bot both of them correct, but 1 day and 1 hour after Max. So Nicki gets a hug, Max gets 10p (unless he really wants a hug) and Jo gets a smile.

       Well Today I was approached by a neighbor ova the road asking whether I could babysit on a Monday night her two kids from bout 8ish till 10ish for a fiver as she goes to a keepfit class, now of course I said yes as it means I get a fiver for doing nothing as both kids will be in bed! Yay. I can watch T.V, do my homework or ne thing really! So it means I wont be on Msn much on a Monday any more cause I wont have time! Also I will find out on Wednesday whether I will have a job, hopefully I will cause I need some money! I am also enjoying Karate at the moment as its really good, although it does leaves you with aching legs for a couple of days after cause they make you do stretching for like 10 mins and it really hurts! But now I can touch my toes and before I went I couldn't touch them, so at least I have learnt something. I will also be starting my first Kata, this is the moves I need to pass for yellow belt, which I will be taking in something like 3 months! Yay Trampolining is also going well, I am starting to learn how to do a backwards somersault as I can now do a front somersault and a front piked somersault! My sister was home again this weekend from Uni, although she didn't spend much of it actually at home, she was out with her mates for most of the time! I think she spent apporx 3 hours actually at home not including sleeping! LOL unfortunately she has to leave at like 3 on a Sunday cause it takes like 5 or 6 hours to get back, this time she was getting driven back so she didn't have to get a number of trains and buses! I am looking forward to the sponsored walk, i don't know why as I'm gonna be knackered afterwards as I'm actually walking the thing instead of helping out! Oh yea does anyone want to sponsor me? You don't have to cause i already got a few but you can if you want to. HEHE

       (These are me trying to do the dullest blogs possible)  Earlier today I was sittiing on a chair. I stood up but felt a little dizzy. I sat down. I stood up again and put on my bag. I took a step forward onto my right foot. I stopped and picked up my jacket. I carried on walking. I went outside. It felt chilly. I took off my bag. I put on my jacket. I was warmer. I carried on walking.

       I wanted to make a drink. I went into the kitchen and I picked up a mug. I put four heaped spoons of hot chocolate powder into the mug. I filled the kettle with water. I put some milk into my mug. I stirred the milk in with the powder until it was a chocolate goo. I waited for the water to boil. I poured the water into the mug. I stirred it up. I took a sip. It burnt my lip. I waited for it to cool. When it was cool I drunk some more. It was nice.

       Nicki was the first to win, so she gets to choose a hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. Jo got it second, so she gets the runners up prize, a smile. :)  Name the object srounded in white.    What is curently on the white/black dot? It's an old photograph, so the buildings around it have changed.    Do not post your ideas on El-Bloggo! Send them to me via e-mail to my normal address. You can now edit and change dates and times on El-Bloggo, plus you might give others ideas!  Not sure how easy/hard you'll find those. If you get both of them you win a massive hug/20 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get one of them correct you win a medium sized hug/15 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get close on both/either of them you get a normal hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. If you have no idea then you get a look of disapointment/-10 pence (you give me money)/take me out to lunch (not quite as good as dinner).  Good luck! I get back Thursday late afternoon. Bye bye.

       If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life, And I had to start again with just my children and my wife, I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today, 'Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that away.    I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.   From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee, Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea. From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A., There's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say:   I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.

That is good because I get paid overtime and its extra because its a Sunday. Btw Jackie, Pam was asking Lora about you. My day was fine. Right now I am not impressed as I am cold, I burnt my pizza again and I have just been attacked by a huge spider and now I am kinda depressed at James, Jon and Leon because I don't liek people hating me or hating me for no reason.

       James, Jon and Leon are those 'freinds'. I don't even know why, they are being silly. I haven't done or said anything to annoy them and thats the truth, I have torn it all apart trying to see what I did which has made them hate me but I haven't done anything. Whatever the problem is its theirs and I can't be bothered with them anymore if they are going to be silly. As I said, I am not that upset with it because I have you guys and you are what is important. Tom, glad its all working out for you! Yay! Max, Jo - BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL.

       School is much better now. I've switched from doing AS Business & Economics to AVCE Business Studies. The main difference is the AS concenrates on the whys of thing, why does the economy work like it does, how does demand and supply work and things that happen right around the world. The AVCE is much more how a business works (as opose to how the world works), so it includes human resources, marketing and general business stuff - something which I'm finding much easier and will probably be more use to me in the long run. Unfortunatly I've had to drop Geography because of that (blocks don't fit) which is a shame - but you can't have it all can you! My NUS card arrived yesterday, and my Driving Licence arrived today! Yay! Hehe.

       What survey? Well I am pissed off with the Sixth Form only because that the party they have organised for us is located at a club/bar we aren't even allowed in so that is gay and pointless. Other than that I am still enjoying Sixth Form. I thinks its fab. Over the past week I have lost 3, what I thought were close, friends but I am not too bothered as I have gained loads more and I still of course have you fabulas guys! Oh THAT survey.

       This guy walks into a bar, pulls out a tiny piano, stool, and a tiny little man. The tiny man sits down, and starts to play the piano. This other guy notices it. "Hey, what's that?" "A twelve-inch pianist. You see, I found this magic lamp, rubbed it, made a wish, I got a twelve inch pianist." "Can I try?" The man with the piano agrees and a minute later, a million ducks fill the room. "Ducks? I didn't wish for a million ducks, I wished for a million bucks!" "You think I really wished for a twelve inch pianist?"

Ok so I had an argument with James from Cumbria trip last night, I don't know if we are speaking now or not but I'm not as bothered now that my friends have grown with new folk and like the grunger lot. Its not too bad. I have found out that on Saturday - and probably Sunday - I will be working at Woolies from 8.30AM to 5.30PM (or later). Argh!!!!! I will be so tired on Monday.

       Oh. Right. Okay then. Glad you had a nice evening.  I would've been there but of course when tickets were purchased I was forgotten about which I'm still slightly annoyed about but oh well. I'm used to it so never mind.  Interesting day at work yesterday. Spent all day on stock room with Dean. Very amusing. He bailed on me for Wednesday though, he forgot he has to work so I only get him for like an hour and you can't see a film in an hour so now I'm gonna see if Rudders wants to come. Did have an idea for Wednesday which I was going to put forward to you Tom but it doesn't matter now seeing as you seem to be in London all the time and I'm sure if my plan work it would turn into another day going anywhere but the place I wanted. Or maybe we'd end up somewhere I didn't have aticket. Oh I don't know. Doesn't matter now.  If Rudders doesn't wanna come to cinema then I guess I'll be at home all day. Wahey. Even though I have tonnes of xmas shopping to you.  I have to go to work. I really don't want to today, I feel too bad and I think I will ask Pam if I can come home if it isn't too busy and there are enough people working. Got my pay. 160. Less than last time but I lost 30 when I was away for the geology trip. Ah well. What is money?   Glad we won. We are the rugby world champions. Yay us. God bless you Johnny.

All-American Rejects, London Astoria. Yay, that was brilliant. Fantastic place, didn't get squished, great music, nice venue, lovely to see Jo again with her super-cool short hair. They finished with The Last Song, and the stupid things is I joked about that before we went in. A couple of them had Union flag thongs, which was, um, nice? One of the support bands where a bit nutty, especialy the guy on the keyboard, he was bouncing around like a headless chicken. Funny though. Many more people crowd surfing than at Enanesence, but not quite as voilent. One guy got on the stage and started worshiping the second support band. So all in all a very pleasent evening, thanks Jo!

Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.

I think some of Jacko's music is ok, even good but as a person he is very very strange.  Bush has gone home today. Hope he enjoyed his pub lunch. Media have been attacked in Baghdad. Wopee. The war is upon us again.  I'm still feeling ill. Headache and stuffy nose now. I didn't leave school until 3pm which was pretty dumb seeing as we had an early closure and I had fourth free so I could've gone home at 1.30. Oh well. Work at 9am tomorrow. Yay.

       First Level of Hell - Limbo  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad.

       Well I got up at 10.30 today. I have no sore throat but now I have a stuffy nose, blocked ears and a werid head.  I had to go to Croydon to get some fabric which I have been putting off for ages. met up with amy who I haven't seen for four months. We went to The George and I was drinking JD and coke and now I feel a bit funny cos I had a few. Apaprently you can get drunk on JD quickly so, er, I think I am bit tipsy? I wil be back tomorrow, shouldn't be cos I'm still ill but i can't afford anymore days off.

        I'm too stupid to eat a Kit-Kat.   I'm pissed off, this is PC or what ever gone way to far. On my Kit-Kat that I have just eaten it did not have Kit-Kat written on it, but on one bar break and the other here. My chocolate has ingraved into it instructions on how to eat it. What else I'm I going to bloody well do with it? It's a fucking Kit-Kat, you break it down the middle, that's why it's there, that's why it has that massive line, everybody knows that and if they don't they are too bloody stupid to read!  Unfortunatly I can't boycott Nestl otherwise I'll have nothing to eat in the mornings (Shreddies, ummmm). But I'm boycotting Kit-Kat, along with McDonalds, Burger King and the Heathrow Express.

Not much else really, apart from when I was doing duties yeterday there was about 200 kids swarming, it was blatanlty obvious that something was happening, but what did we do? nothing. We decided it looked too scary and they were taller than us, so we just watched. Then teachers of all shapes and sizes started running after them, shouting and yelling at them and each other. It later aspired that there was some kinda major fight and then two other serious isolated incidents, and we did nothing. Makes me feel quite guilty really. Hey ho, life goes on.

Had to work again last night, shut myself in a cage by accident while taking cages out to lorry. Erm...what else?? Textiles is going good. Geology still sucks but Seward is helping me a bit more now. I had a chat with him and at least we know where the other one stands. Scottie-doo is talking to me again even though I still don't know why he wasn't in the first place. But hey, hes back at least. Erm...what else. Yea Jackie brought me some mice earlier from Woolies. I ate them. I have to work tomorrow 8.30 - 6.00. Great. Oh well. I get to see Dean haven't seen him in a while.

       I spoke to Carvell today. She is going to leave Seward a note and she said she'll sit in on a lesson next week. I'm not sure entirely why, maybe to see how I am in lessons or how Seward reacts to me asking for help? I'm not sure. I just hope it will work. Actually thinking about it now I hope I haven't got Seward into trouble.  Shit. I've just messed everything up now haven't I? Omgomgomgomg. Why can't everything be simple??? Ok I better go now and sort my head out cos its just got incredibly full of random confused thoughts again like Friday.

Fortuantely I don't have alot to do, otherwise I would be stuffed.  I have till training at 5pm tomorrow, I hope it all goes ok and I don't end up looking too stupid! Anyway. I got my lovelly fleece and my name badge yesterday, I haven't got my trousers and my shirts yet, so at the moment I have to wear my own black trousers, a whiote shirt, and keep my jacket done up, lol. Fair enough. Anyway, I really should go and do some work now because I should. Otherwise I'll feel vyer bad. My bargain buy for the day was 3 paris of tights from Primark in Bromely- red, blue and turqoise- 1 each. To go with my bargain boots and my bargian skirt. Wahey. I'm strange. Whatever. See y'all later guys. Bye

That blog about me feeling happier - lies! All lies! I need to speak to Madame Carvell on monday, Pennie has ordered me to. She said that I really need to go tell someone. I guess it makes sense. I don't want to spend every lunch time like I did on Friday. :(

Thinking of doing the IMAX for my birthday but not sure at the moment. What do you think? After the film (you'll all be proud of me for this! I am!!!) I went into the leather shop and asked them about the Matrix Reloaded jacket they have in the window. He let me try it on! Woooooooooooo! And it suited me! Honest it did! I WILL be saving up for it. Trust me. I'm going to Spain on the art trip. Wahoo!

       Yeah that's very true. Good point. With my politics lessons we watched this thing called "Mark Thomas: Debt Collector" and what I heard was appauling. Loads of big corporations like HSBC and other ones that lent money to Saddam's regime and sold him weapons worth millions, now he's gone they're demanding their money back. Iraq's debt is something like 30 billion and is going up all the time due to interest. HSBC are demaning something like 200 million back from Iraq, which puts like a 12,000 debt on the head of every Iraqi- money they simply don't have and can't get. I thought that was really rude an absolutely ridiculous, but this program was really eye-opening.  Anyway, enough of that, but I am finding politics really interesting now I actually understand about it! Shut up Jo. Go do something useful.

       There is something else I would like to bitch about. Attitudes to war. People are still slagging off Iraq and our involvment as well as Americas. I can see why people are so against it but I wish people would just give it up and give their soliders the support they deserve. I sat here and listened to someone go on and on about the mess we've made well we haven't! We've taken away the rules and are trying to put in place new ones will are more beneficial to the country. GAH.

       I agree with Jackie again. Except that I don't drink alcohol mainly because the stuff I do drink is never at the parties we go to. I am what some of my sisters uni mates call a 'mature drinker' because I drink stuff like JD and Coke or champagne. I don't like the cheaper alcopops and things. I can see why Jackie drinks and I think teh way she drinks is fine. She has a few but never enough to make her tipsy or anything more. I don't have a problem with people like that I just don't like folk getting drunk because its just plain stupid. Back to the example of Andy - missed his own party. Jenny at his party, threw up everywhere and probably felt like shit the next day liek most who got pissed. Its dumb. You can't remember it so whats the point in even going? Our leavers ball - it was mainly the popular or tarty lot that were drunk, they can't remember half of it. Our lot: no alcohol, just high on the buzz of the evening and we can remember every precious moment. Glad Dave's party was good. I spent the evening doing bloody homework because I was given way to much to do. I mean its half term for goodness sake, its a holiday. We should be relaxing, getting our systems back to their full potential not running them down further by working. Its not even as if I actually went away on holiday. I spent a few days on the geology trip which was doing geology work so that is fair enough, then two days with my sister at her uni who I haven't seen since she went which again is fair enough. I think family comes before college. I wouldn't be suprised if I told the teachers 'I haven't had time to do the work because I was in hospital after being a car accident' and even if it was true they would still yell at me.  I am sick of life right now. I mean is it really worth all this? All this stress over a few pieces of work, the stress of earning enough money, the stress of knowing what you want to do in life and who you want to be with. Its too much and soon its gonna get me. As Spike says:  From Beneath You It Devours

       Nicki - I wasn't having a go, anyway if you want me to, I will, so here goes....  MAX PAYNE 2 IS THE BEST GAME EVAR!!!  There aint really much to say except its bloody brilliant.  Yup, and Dave.D's party was kewl, Andy kept chucking stuff up this girl's skirt and Rob was dancing quite happily with this pissed girl. At the end of the party, Lee phoned his house to ask if his parents could pick him up. Okay, so when his parents didnt turn up half an hour later, we dropped him back home. He lived literally 30 seconds walk from Dave's house. *Hits head hard on table*.

       Yes i happily drink alcohol, but i have never drunk more than 3 bottles in one night, i have never got drunk and if there is no alcohol then i dont give a flying fuck. And from knowing my sister and her friends and half of the school most peeps are not like me, ask most peeps and there idea of a good night is going out and getting drunk so that they dont remeber a thing that happened! For me thats just sad? Why bother going out at all if your not gonna remebr ne of it? I'd rather go out and have no alcohol and be with my mates all night long! Just think Andy missed his own party cause he went over the top with alcohol.  Alcohol is just another thing for the government to make money on. In fact i dont even like the taste of most alcohol the only reason ireally drink it is to fit in, if i go to a party and everyone is drink ing then i will do it or peeps say- "omg your sad, how can you not drink? your 16 not 6" I find dat quite annoying so i drink. I'm just glad im sensible not to drink to much to end up throwing all over the place! And just to let you know I'm feeling kinda stressed so if that sounds rude... Then it IS!

Sad, aren't I? Anyway, Just got a whopping fat history essay to do today, ippee. I haven#'t seen PAul in over a week, boohoo. Can't see him today- too much work to do.

       I agree with Jackie about the alcohol. You see what kinda of trouble sixteen year olds do get into and then eighteen year olds. Its pretty outrageous. And TOm I don't think Jackie is being hypocritical because yes she does drink quite happily at parties but she doesn't go out of her way to get drunk like Pennie and Helen. Jackie is one of these people where if there is alcohol she will have some, not loads, some. If there isn't then fine. It doesn't matter. I think? Jackie? Max - you never told me that. You haven't exactly blogged all aboutit like you usually do going on and on about the graphics etc..  You know how everyone seems to have 2 lines. One line is simple to get to, it can be crossed by something hurtful or by general stress. The second line is harder and when you get to it thats when you seriously start to think about things, life, people. Is it really worth it? I'm nearing that second line rapidly. I can't handle the amount of work I have. I don't have the time. I can't work any harder than I am now.

       Well I had a very sleepless night last night. I didn't go to Dave's party because I had way too much work to do so yesterday afternoon / evening I sat upstairs and did my art and as much of my textiles as I can (bearing in mind the machine I borrowed from school broke, helpful). I think I had like a 40 minute break when I was the phone to Jackie and that was it. Okay so maybe 40 minutes is an exageration. I don't know. However, I didn't sleep well because I was stressing out way too much. I need these final pieces done but I can't do them. I still have all my English Lit to do and I can't do it because I don't have the time. This is way too much and if I am not careful I will probably have one of those anexity attacks or just generally freak out.

       Yes the film starts at 12.15. I said on the email see you in the screen rather than everyone meeting before cos they could be quite a few of us.  The air marshalls would be disguised as normal passengers. The ones in Amnerica are on all flights in the US. If there were 6 terrosists as you say then ok so maybe it wouldn't work but at least those on the plane would have a better chance to live rather than dieing without a fight. Like those on teh plane that was headed for the whitehouse, it crashed before then because of the passengers taking over. They died yes, but they still gave themselves a small chance. I can see what you mean as well about them coming over from the Muslim countries but the amount of terrosists we have in our country right now is amazing. So many have been caught etc.. I don't know if it would work but I think its worth a try. Air marshalls to be on suspected flights or random flights. You never know, they may just be there to help one day.

       I believe that the air marshals are going to be disguised as ordinary civillians. Which then suggests that actually, they aren't going to be on many flights.  very good point Jackie. The only time someone has tried to hijack a plane on their own was when that AFrican bloke who was criminally insane tried to take over. But he really was mentally ill I think. If terrorists were going to hijack a plane and do something really evil and horrible, then I would presume there would be a few people, like a team of them. That's what they did on 9/11, I think.   I can't come to the cinema tomorrow, I have to be at work for 2pm. Sorry guys!  How typical is this- (you know on american web pages where they put the top-5 searches? This is one of them, and not off a dodgy site either, the netscape news site!):  Top Men's Searches     Wet T-Shirts  Beach Trips  Micro Bikini  Viagra  Adult Toys

       Guns on airplanes to me sounds like a stupid idea! If that person needed the money someone cud buy them and get them to give them the gun on a flight! Not only that but if there are like 6 terrorists on the plane they can easily take the plane, the air marshals wud be shot and killed possibly with their own guns! Are these air marshals gonna be wearing uniforms? Or are they just gonna look like normal passingers? Nicki you saying about  maybe only on transatlantic flights? Whats that gonna do? the terrorists will be more likely to pick on local flights as they did on the 9/11 attack. Most of the planes brought down were local ones!  No onto more pressing matters... The cinema tmor? You sed meet at 12.15? The film actually starts then though!

       Hmmm. Well I'm still standing by my comments of yesterday, I just wanted to add a few things in response to people's comments. Although I agree to some extent with what Max said, there was still a fair amount of child abuse going on, it just wasn't 'done' to publicise it. For example Myra Hindley, the Moors Murders, the West murders, the kid who was abused and then hung from a tree in Reigate..... there were numerous notorious child abusers/murders. I think it can't have been so easy to get guns 20 or 30 years ago, I think a lot of the guns nowadays are imported cheaply and illegally from America. Hence tighter import checks and better security, and higher penalties for being caught. I don't like the idea of air marshals. Ok, perhaps it may stop loonies from trying to hijack a flight, but why sholud they get them just on trans-atlantic flights? I would have thought that there would be a much higher risk coming from flights from the middle east to Britain and from the middle east to the USA. Without being rascist (although it's going to sound it), most of the terrorists are 'freedom fighters' etc from Muslim and Arab countries. I understand that you can't put air marshals on their flights because they are Arab airlines (not British and American ones), but I really do not think it is anything to do with flights from Britain. What I want to know is,  who is paying for these air marshals- us, the British tax-payers; or the Americans, who are the ones who are so up-tight about it anyway?  I woudl lay my money on it being us who has to fork out for it. But there we go again, me getting back to how Blair has become Bush's lap-dog. Absolutley disgusting that one man can just do what he wants at will with a country.  My final moan for the day on the point of guns. It's not directly related, but I think it needs to be said.  I personally believe that capital punishment should be brought back. People like Ian Huntley do not deserve to live. Ok, God said "Thou shalt not kill", but surely that works both ways- we shouldn't kill him, but he sholudn't have killed in the first place? But look back to the old testament- "An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"- surely this suggests that he should get what's coming to him? More and more British citizens are being imprisoned, and half the time they aren't even British citizens! This pushes up the price of keeping prisoners all the time, and like all the other good things in life, the money spent on the prisons by the good old British governemtn has to come from the tax payers. It would be a darn site cheaper to execute them. No mess, no hassle, no money, no protests about them being allowed to go on hunger strike, not giving them the safety of being locked up so they can't be mobbed for their heinous crimes, not giving them the chance to take their own lives and become 'martyrs' for other criminals of their types. Numerous states in America still use capital punishment, so why can't we? I believe that would be the answer. We should become a more agressive state in our policing policies- more police, more security for them, more severe punishment. Not just 'life sentences' that turn into 10 years behind bars because the culprit has 'reformed' or is let out on 'good behaviour'. If they're sick enough to commit a crime in the first place, then that violent/sadistic/homicidal/perverted/abusive tendancy is always going to be there.  Think that's all i wanted to have a moan about.

       I like the points everyone has made. Especially Jo's. Remember thsi can be discussed all week so we can keep this going. And make it to the blogs of note one day :) hehe.  Guns. Well. I look at America where it is so easy to get a gun. Open a bank account, get a free gun! That is outrageous. It gives the police there no authority at all. I think here our poilce force should be allowed guns. Not big guns, handguns maybe, some sort of gun. Or at least get officers out and about where they can be seen with guns so not everyone can carry then. I think knowing the police have guns would make people think twice about it so I agree with what Jo said. Even though I dislike the French...  I agree with you Jackie about there always being crime but hopefully the presense of guns would decrease general crime or at least put a stop to these shootings. Yes the highest trained gunman could miss but then think of the damage someone who isn't trained could do. I'd rather know there was someone at least slightly trained with a gun than someone who knows little. How about these air marshalls? Guns on planes? I think that we should have them on transatlanic flights, they aremost likely to be hijacked and as American have proved it has worked so far. I understand the worries about guns and the pressure of teh cabin but I think someone said on sky news they woudl take that into consideration and modify the planes or something. Someone else has created bullets which are made specially not to cause damage to the area. One shatters on impact and things like that. I think they are a good idea as I know what its like to be sitting there on a 9 hour flight and wondering what could happen.

       Let a load of people (like the Krays) out on the streets (with guns). When they were around, there was a lot less child abuse and the like. Why? Because the child abusers/killers were frightened because they would be found by em and get killed.  Ian Huntley would have been dead long ago.

       Guns- Death  Thats basically my veiw, guns shouldnt be allowed ne where, surely there must be a better way of patrolling the streets, even if the highest trained professional gun shooted could mis aim and therefor fatally injure someone. I beleive that things like stun guns should be made standard issue for  policce officers as they are far less dangerous. But there again jo has made a good point, crimals wont be so inclined to perform illegal acts if they see police carrying guns.  But if you think about it there will always be crime, whether it be viscious or not. There is nothng we can do to stop it. In my view prevention is better than stopping it mid way.

       No I don't think we should be allowed to carry guns. Bad news. Knives are illegal, and I presume so are guns? I deinetly don't think we shoudl be allowed them, because there is such a fine line between 'self defence' and 'attack' that it woudl be so hard to tell the difference, and there would just be unlawful killings happening left, right and centre. Can you imagine what croydon would be like with guns? http://www.defense.gouv.fr/gendarmerie/ However, I do believe that we should have two branches of the police, as france do. They have the 'Gendarmerie' and 'Police'. The police are like the local units who just work in the rural areas, minor offences in rural areas, blah blah, i think. Then the Gendarmerie are the more military-style ones '[I think they actually refer to themselves as being a branch of the French Army, see  urlLink the official website (If not just for the pictures!) ) ], who patrol urban areas and cities. This reduces the crime rate in cities, and France have a very low gun-crime rate, I believe. I believe that this is due to the scary image of the Gendarmerie- they have bold blue uniforms (shirts, trousers and jackets, all of same colour), knee length leather boots, black caps, and they  all carry guns  , in highly visible places. Yet the french never have any 'incidents' of accidental shooting of police officers and innocent civillians. In addition, in the big towns like Paris, they have gendermerie armed with sub-machine guns. Now that is a scary site, but crime rates? What crime??! I believe our policing system should be changed to allowed armed officers in the centres of towns and high-risk districts, not to protect themselves and other citizens, but to deter and prevent gun-crime altogether. Say you were about to commit and violent mugging on a women, say you were going to knife her to ger her handbag, money and phone, you would perhaps consider it if you see two lone policemen walking down the street, say 500m away, not near enough to catch you. But what if those same two policemen each had a gun holster containing standard-issue pistols? I wouldn't even dream of it, and I don't think any criminal would either. I rest my case.

Cinema on Wednesday, 12.15, Grants, Peter Pan. Come if you wish, bring who you want.  Question / topic to discuss this week:  Guns.  A policeman was killed a few days ago from a shooting. Should we be allowed to carry guns? America have a death rate of over 11,000 people a year being killed by guns. Your views?

       Ok so the title bar only appears when you are blogging but I guess that may help if you are scanning pats posts? I've been wokring since Friday. Yesterday luckily it wasn't busy at all and didn't have to open the front till too much. I got to put out the pic'a'mix yesterday with Charlene and Lora which was hilariously funny. You have no idea how much fun it is. LOL.  Today I'm on entertainment all day as Caroline is off on holiday. Should be ok.  Tomorrow I have to run into Croydon to get fabric for textiles and then I have to leave because mother is getting my Birthday things. Yayness. Wednesday I'm going to see Peter Pan with Ritchie. I will do something for my birthday with everyone but prob once we are back at college on an evening I know everyone is free. Took a trip last night up to the infamous addington estate. That is not an area you want to park the car in trust me...keep it moving. LOL. Dad was showing me some of the houses there. One of the houses is decorated with lights and whatnot. But tha front is covered, the back is covered, the side is covered and the roof is covered. And its soooo tacky!!! Have fun today!

       Interesting idea. I had an idea a while ago which would make the blog more exciting (slightly) and would hopefully get some good discussions going. Each week I will ask someone to choose a subject / event or sme kind of question. Then basically you spend the next week discussing it as well as normal blogging. For example the title could be: "President Bush". Then people can use that as a starting point. What do you think?

       Have you read those blogs that won awards from that guardian competition? I read the two teenage winners. The boys one was good but not very funny, but the girl called Olivia, hers is just so random that it's really funny. Completly random. I think we should do something to spice up our blog. Like have different cateogries and put someone in charge of each category. Like Our News, World News and our Views, Events in our lives, stuff like that, make  it funny and not just a regular ole blog.

We came back with nothing so we had lunch and with the firm instructions from mother of 'go and get some christmas lights' we headed out again. Went way out, right off to the M25 to a garden centre there. We brought a set of new crimbo lights, a new candle light set and this sicky stuff to hang your crimbo cards up on. So all in all, a sucess. Yesterday evening Jackie and I went to see  Elf ! I loved it. I love kiddies films. Soooo funny. SAAAAAAAANTA! I know him! I know him!

Big Bags of chocolate coins for 39p, and HUGE drums of xmas-tree marshmellows for only 99p. Bargain. Plus 10% off, makes life so much more fun. My mummy got 47 off her shopping in double discount weekend, twas very cool! Meant that the alcohol i pursuaded her to buy was only 3.20- bargain! Anywho, must go now!

       That was very phiospical Max.  Well on Thursday I went shopping with Jackie which was un as we found Beckett and spent about 30 mins sitting on those massage things. How amusing.Yesterday I went to Croydon with Lisa. We shopped ( I brought some skate jeans ) and had pizza hut which was fun. We have a Dutch waiter! Today I worked from 8.30 til 5.30. I have Dean his present, must have been happy with it cos he gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek so that made my made of course. Tomorrow I'm working from 10 til 4.30. Them Monday and Tuseday will most likely be me doing homework as I have many a final piece to do. Wednesday I'm working 1 - 6. Friday I'm working 12.30 - 5.30. Thats good because that is overtime pay so wopee!!  On crimbo day it will be me, Mum, Caz and Dad. That is good because last year we had to post pone xmas for a day as Dad was working so we had our xmas on Boxing day. dad is working on my birthday though which means I'll be spending most of the day worrying because new year eve's party goers who get drunk and stuff can cause an awful amount of trouble and it has been known for police to get injured etc.. so I won't be that happy on that night. Gah.

       Okay Max, Maybe you need to get out a bit more? Well today woz judgement day, i went and saw lord of the rings. Now it woz a gud film although i beleive it could of been considerably cut down in length cause there were many parts you didnt need to see. Also the cinema didnt put a break in like they said a little while ago on there site! I was quite annoyed with that cause i didnt wanna miss ne of the film by going to the toilet! So i waited till it had finshed then rushed to the toilet, ask Andy Scott and DAvid i woz in there for a while! But over all a good film, i would advise you to go see it, but only if you seen the first two films otherwise you would get a bit lost in the plot! So wot are peeps Crimbo plans? Ne one going ne where specail? Tmor im working in the morning then going to my cousins for crimbo dinner, then sunday im working. On crimbo day i think my grandparents are coming over so that should be fun! Other than wokring thats about all im doing!

       Something pretty scary happened today...  I was bored, and I looked at the clock on my PC. The year scale went right up to 2099. By 2099, I would be about 112. No way am I going to live that long. Then something occured to me; one of the dates that is sitting in right front of me is the day i'll die. Nice thought, no? And as well as the fact that the PC could outlive me in terms of time...  Anyhow, um...prawn cocktail Wotsits are minging.

       Alternatively, you could embrace the christmas vibe by inviting evey stray dog into the neighbour hood and feeding them roast ham and dog biscuits. That's always fun.

       No Jo. I am not excited. I have too much work to do. Fuck xmas, it can piss off this year.  Damit. Its all your fault Jackie. Because you didn't babysit last night, and you didn't do the weekly text thing I completely forgot Changing Rooms was on!  I MISSED IT. O how depressing. I think I shall fall into Hamlet mode: 'O that this too too sulied flesh would melt....' Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Yay for the trampoling thing though. An I don't go on about it, only mentioned it once because of the hand signal convo. Thats it. Its like my geology class. Every lesson its usually Beckett who brings it up but the subject of Dean and I always comes into conversation. And the room always goes quiet just as we aretalking about it so then either the whole class join in or we're told we are a bunch of gays by Seward. Ahhhh.

       No I'm not excited, possibly because i havent brought any presents yet! My sister arrived home around 1 hour ago, came in for about 20 mins and tehn went striaght back out again! ( You can tell she was glad to see us) I'm really happy at the moment as i just got back from trampolining and i can now do a back summersault into a seat drop! Considering i only passed my back summersault last week im quite proud of myself! I seem to have a bit of a cold, not a runny nose cold but a annoying sore throat, which isnt always there and a horrible throaty gooey feeling... I am also very happy cause i didnt have to babysit tonite! Which means that i have moe time to do homework.. Althoughi bet i dont do anything in this extra time i have been given. I wish i had never told people who i fancy now cause thats all they sem to go on about! Grrrr, How annoying. And no guys you aint finding out who unless i already told you or you find out from somone i told! Now this is feeling like a very long blog to me so i think i will bring it to a bit of a abrupt end.

       I'm here guys. I've just been exceptionally tired, ill, and so exhausting I come home from school and collapse, and I am getting up so incredibly early to use my light box now, I have hardly any spare time. Oh the joys of being a student/cashier at safeways. At least they pay me lots, and I'm getting a new phone! It's contract, 13.99 a month with 50 free texts amd 750 free minutes, and it's a Nokia 6100! Wahey! I'm excited. Are you?

       I can't believe the gramatical error made: "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him." It should be "we've got him" or "we have got him", not "we got him"; it doesn't make any sense like that. Argghh.

       This pisses me off, terrestrial television listing for today, 11:30AM:  BBC1: Saddam news report BBC2: Saddam news report ITV: Saddam news report Channel 5: Saddam news report Channel 4: Hollyoaks  Police force? It needs to be improved. A zero-tolerance rule should be applied like in the states.  We havent got our Christmas tree up yet. It will be up Tuesday when my Dad gets back from knocking a wall down in his brothers house.

       Interesting interesting. No I haven't heard from Jo. Not since I saw her at Speech day.   I spent half an hour last night sitting in front of my christmas tree thinking about my final art piece for Starky, based around Autobiography. It can be anything so long as you can somehow link it back to you. My link is that my father was a firefighter.  My piece will be based around those firefighters lost in September 11th. (By the way, I releasied this in general studies last week, the Americans go on and on about what a tragedy it was for all those firefighters to die. Fair enough. But what about the paramedics and police? They died too. They all do the same life threatening job. Just in different ways.) What I will do is construct a war cross (American war cemetryes which I have visited - a plain white cross). I will not paint it white but photocopy headlines and pages from books about September 11th and the firefighters. I will cover my cross in it and then create rubble around the base. I want people to remember. I want people at the art exhibitiono to go: 'Wow. I remember that. That piece is really good, I'm impressed.' I remember at last years exhibition someone did a 9/11 piece. It created many a comment.

       I quite like these new community police, they are quite helpful and seem to be doing a great job. When we went up to London on Monday on a coach we drove the whole length of where Croydon is - it really does go quite a long way until it becomes London; but anyway, I saw about 10 of them and half of them were talking to people and doing things. Fortunately I haven't had to talk to a police man for quite a little while, but I hate this racist issue. The press seem to think that every single person in the Met is racist and say they should get more black officers. In case you haven't noticed, you can't advertise specifically for that kind of thing as that is racist. The whole thing has to much PC behind it and I hate it all. I am quite intilted to say what I am about to say as it is a view, a belief, an experience and is true, but there are more black people causing on-the-street crime than white. This is true, and I know myself, all three of the blokes who mugged me where black; and their ain't that many black people wondering around Sanderstead village at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon in January. So, my point is, the whole thing about stop-and-search being done to more black people than white seems fair to me entirely. I know a police man, in fact I know three, but this one in particular was talking to me about this issue when he worked for Croydon police, and white people do more robbery from houses and other non-violent crime, where as black people do more violent crime. The problem is, there is more violent crime around at the moment. Point made.  Another thing that is really annoying me at the moment is the 'new look' BBC News 24. It's rubbish. The idea of this channel was to become different from all the other 24 hour news channels, to be unique - which it was. Now it looks even more like Sky News which I despise, they are all following the horrible American TV which is truly terrible. BBC Three is dropping the only show I watch on that channel, Liquid News, and instead they had Johnny Vaughn with that chat show he did, which again is identical to these American ones where the audience clap whenever the presenter says a word that has 3 or more syllables in it. So I'm not impressed with the BBC at the moment - although I have been listening to Radio 4 quite a lot recently, I'm turning into an old man.  Oh yeah, one more thing (maybe). Today, while in HMV, browsing my way through the CDs, two blokes next to me, having a chat. Normal everyday things people do; but what are they doing while talking to each other? Holding their penis. Really, you know it's there, you probably saw it this morning when you were getting changed, do you really need to hold it all the time? I know it sticks out a bit, but you can buy special underwear that holds it in if you have those kind of problems. If you're afraid it's going to fall off, don't worry, this is the 21st century, we can glue it back on. But seriously, stop holding your cock, it just isn't right, especially when you're talking to another bloke, and in public.  I watched the Railway Children today, and it made me realise how much PC we have in this world today. It is so stupid it's not true. Signs everywhere telling us what to do and what not to do. Don't stick your head out the window. Don't jump off the cliff. This packet of nuts contains nuts. In the movie, the children are allowed to go out, run around the place, be happy, explore. Now, they would have to be with an adult and wouldn't be able to go and talk to the station master. Alright, East Croydon isn't exactly the best place, but smaller ones like Sanderstead and this wonderful little station in North Wales I went to. The village has about 10 houses in it, and the station is so small you have to ask the train driver to stop at the station when you get on the train; and wave your hand when you see the train coming to stop it.  I'm worried about Jo. She said something about her PC not working, so I can understand her not being on MSN or blogging; but I've text her earlier today and no reply. Hope all is well, anybody heard from her?  Blimey that's a long blog. Need to have a nap now.

       Ok so no one is blogging. Lets have a discussion.  Police. The British police. Croydon police. What do you think?  Asking this because it comes up every bloody general studies lesson and I am putting together my argument about it so that next lesson I can have my say.

       My hand has gone kinda numb this morning and was hurting yesterday. As I won't be at the doctors anytime soon I thought I'd look up what I have on the internet. It may be wrong but I think this is pretty much hitting the nail on the head.    Description  Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when tendons in the wrist become inflammed after being aggravated. A tunnel of bones and ligaments in the wrist narrows, pinching nerves that reach the fingers and the muscle at the base of the thumb. The first symptoms usually appear at night. Symptoms range from a burning, tingling numbness in the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers, to difficulty gripping or making a fist.    Treatment  Carpal tunnel syndrome is treated by immobilizing the wrist in a splint to minimize or prevent pressure on the nerves. If that fails, patients are sometimes given anti-inflammatory drugs or injections of cortisone in the wrist to reduce the swelling. There is also a surgical procedure in which doctors can open the wrist and cut the ligament at the bottom of the wrist to relieve the pressure. However, only a small percentage of patients require surgery.

       That's a rather unfortunate acronym, kind of ironic as well.  I haven't blogged for quite a while, nearly two weeks. What have a done? Not a lot really. I've been listening to Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas quite a lot, which is quite odd because it's not my normal taste in music, but I really like this song; and I have been introduced to Sugarcult who just rock. Rather stressed with the amount of work I have to do, but it's nearly holiday time, only two weeks left, so I'm not too worried. It's my birthday on Saturday, having a driving lesson which should be amusing! Bought my Christmas cards this evening with Jo & co in Oxted (haha, that rhymes).  So a mix of really good and really bad things - I supose they level out.

       Jackie: New look Hotmail. New GUI. Login.  GCSE Certificates are okay now, they were posted to me yesterday and I got em when I come home.  3 things that I think are totally different from each other: I love... (example: "I think she has a really kind nature that I like") I fancy... (example: "Rah! She's well fit!") I like... (example: "Aw, ur nice") Don't quite know how to put that one.

       That Max is why you want a nice four wheeler. Camden was so good today. In fact all of today was good. Paul is so fab.  I am presuming Jo is not posting deliberatly. Well if there is no word from her by end of week I will remove her from blog and we can invite someone else to join. I leave the choice of who to add into blog up to you guys as I think that is what will happen as Jo is being childish.  Tom - your views on the subject of workload?

       Technology: sometimes useless. Example:  10 minutes ago there was this car trying to get up my road. Its not a particularly steep hill, but nethertheless, this big brand new PHAT BMW was trying its hardest to climb the snowy road. Anyhow, it was doing this outside my house for a good 15 minutes. Along came an old, battered Citroen AX or something and went up the hill just as if it wasn't snowing. Useless car designs.

       Ah well that then brings back the question about technology that Max said. Is todays technology like computers, broadband etc.. distracting us from what we SHOULD be doing or is it really just a matter of choice? I personally don't think the workload is too much overall. Its more down to finding the time to cope with it. I for one cannot cope at the moment what with the mocks coming up. I have a 5 hour art exam this Friday and I don't have a clue what I'm doing. Ihave a 5 hour textiles exam next Wednesday and no idea what I'm doing. Add that to Eng Lit where we have to memorise literally the whole novel of 'Enduring Love' as it is not allowed into the exam with us and gelogy of which I do not have a clue. Plus general studies which I don't have any guesses as to what will happen. Its too much. Not too much work just too much pressure to have it at such a high standard even though it needs to be at that high a standard for alevel.

I'm really happy atm. Probably because of Paul. I've got a hair appointment for the day of the Valentines Ball in London so I'm gonna have gorgeous straight hair :) I hope you all like, well, those of you that go. You should come, as a large group, it'll be a good night out I reckon.   And you are allowed to bring people from outside of school so bring people!!  I'm also looking to the cinema tomorrow.

       We are a lazy soceity, the rate of obestitiy proves it! 30- 40 yrs ago there wernt T.V's and computers so children went outside to play EVERYDAY, not once a week for 10 mins but they would spend all day outside just playing and mucking around Because all of this new stuff is around children dont do anything, and aldults are just as bad! I'm not saying that i dont agree with all this new technology as it makes life a lot easier and conviente. But what i think needs to happen is control over what is used by parents ect..

       Now Jo thats just silly and how can you be boycotting this blog if your still posting?   Anyway. Lazy society hey? Well. I think the introduction of this ne wmodern technology has completely changed the way we live. Its faster to do things etc... Unfortunatly people are becoming more lazy with dirving to work instead of walking, phoning a friend instead of going around to see them etc.. But on the other hand with this technology being available shouldn't it be up to that person to decide if they use it, or if they don't? I think most of London certainly are getting lazier. Very much so.

       Yes and no. In some cases it has made life easier: i.e: Typing a letter. Thats how it should be. But now we have these super fast PC's *ahem* that play games and scan in our math h/w and it'll do it all for us and spellcheck it.  Phones are lazy as well, whatever happened to the phonebox?  This is the way I see it: It is making society lazier. But I like it somewhat, as long as it isn't expensive for its purpose. For example, a smartphone (costing 500) is enough for me to build a nippy mid-class PC, which I think has more use than the smartphone, plus its cheaper to run. On the other hand, a phone costing 100 range is fair enough.

        Do you think that technology has made society lazy?  Technology includes: phones, computers, cars, etc.

       OK Jackie, in that case  Tom  can post this week.  Jo, no one said don't grow up just when your blogging when we're havinga  discussion about a topic can you not do it in a supier way. It seems to be that just because you go to Oxted you appear to me automatically more intelligent than us. Your not. Maybe you know more about certain subjects than us do but we're bound to know more than you do in the ones we study.  I get the felling when your blogging away its: 'You can't have that opinion because you don't know the ins and outs so you better change your mind' and then proceed to give us all a full lesson in politics etc...  So this week so should be interesting. I missed my textiles deadline for Friday last week so I should've done all the work over the weekend but I didn't because of work and the fact my sister came home. Work on Sunday was insane. The health and saftey officier decided to pay us a visit in the afternoon so I spent all morning running around cleaning stuff, making asiles safe, helping to clear up stock room. I also had to sweep up all of the trash outside to clear the fire exit. Yuk! I spent last hour or so in the canteen clearing that up and then the entertainment room. It was crazy.  And when I got home I realised I had left my posters by my locker. Darn.

       I sorta agree with Nicki on dis one Jo, On the last blog you seemed to go on bout how we didnt put up a proper arguement ect.. Well its only a blog not an essay to be marked!!! And 6th form is college, its just that it is attachted toa skool! We get the same sorta amrks as colleges so it dnt matter! And nicki U cnt have paul cause ur mineeeeeeeeeeee

       FOR FUCKS SAKE ITS JUST A FUCKING PLACE TO LEARN STUFF. Look, definitions of it:   College  An undergraduate division or school of a university offering courses and granting degrees in a particular field.  IE: SIXTH BLOODY FORM  AAAAAAAAAH. Now I have been getting the feeling recently Jo that you don't seem to be liking me right now. Whenever we've had discussions on here you seem to love writing paragraphs about how wrong I am and you seem to like to point out your intelligence by bringing up facts etc... Just because I do Art and Textiles doesn't mean I don't know my own opnion. I don't need facts and figures to base my thoughts on. And so what if we go to Sixth Form which happens to be at Warlingham? It is a college, its not better or worse than anywhere else.  And I'd rather you wouldn't post random comments about Paul and Charlene or whoever because you will start to put thoughts into my head and I will start to panic so could you possibly refrain from doing so. That and remember we're not stupid so can you not talk to us as though we are. Or me. Or to anyone else who feels simlar.  Yes I am in an annoyed mood today.

       Its still a college though. Maybe its a bit more set or whatever but its still a college. I prefer Warlingham to going somewhere like East Surrey. Its pretty damm good.  Paul is loverly :)

       How I think of it:  College = East Surrey. No specific times you have to be in. Not ajoined to secondary school. Specific classrooms for specific purposes. Pretty 'loose' campus. 6th Form = Warlingham. Specific times set. Joined onto secondary school. Must follow main school rules. Uses normal secondary school rooms.

       Warlingham has been a college since the Sixth Form begun. That is why it is: Warlingham Sixth Form. Sixth Form being collage. Sixth Form being another name for college.  Plus I prefer to say college than school.  Still an excellent Sixth Form. Nowt wrong with it.

       I stayed utnil 5.30 last night at college. I was doing textiles as I have a deadline for today but I also went to see one of Paul's plays for drama. I've never seen him act before and wow! I am sooo impressed! He is so good! The rest of his group were excellent but I was so impressed with Paul! Yay!!!!!

        With the NHS in the state that it is currently in, should they be forced to treat people, like smokers, who bring illness upon themselves? And what about hypochondriacs who waste valuable space? Should they be treated?    I think with the NHS they should simply take a step back, look at themselves and then sort themselves out. There must be a logical way to sort out the long lists etc... somewhere. Hypochondriacs - well ok so they do waste space, sometimes. Maybe sometimes what they say is true. But they are still entiled to hospital visits. Perhaps it should just be a case of making doctors etc.. more efficent so that they can spot these people, check them out throughly but get them out quickly. Smokers - I don't like smokers. I hate it. Its the thing itself I hate but the people I dislike are todays generation. They all know the risks, they all know it could kill them yet they still go ahead. They are dumb. But those from our parents generation and before, they didn't know and now they do they can't stop. Its a fair argument. Its hard to quit it if you've been smoking for years. They should be entilted to free health care. It isn't their fault. Techically it is for smoking something that is damaging but they didn't know. My gran died from lung cancer and brain tumor. Created by smoking. I had to watch her die and I wish something could've been done about it but it couldn't. I don't blame her for smoking, I don't even blame the cigarette itself. I blame the fact that back then, she didn't know. Maybe it was cool, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it's just something they all did but the fact is she didn't know the dangers, couldn't give it up. Thats fair. Wish she'd have known, wish she would've stopped but hey, I can't do anything about it now.   But back to the question in hand.  Smokers should be given free health care. There should also be more warnings etc.. for us today. Maybe we should even take a lead of out Dublins book and become a city where you are not allowed to smoke in public. In your own home etc.. fine but not in public.  Then again. If your mum or dad had been smoking and you believed they shouldn't get free health care because its their choice, what if they became ill and weren't allowed in hospital. Even though something could be done to save them? You'd have to watch them suffer, maybe die. Its not nice. Would you still feel the same way? Even if they didn't know the risks at the time?

       Many apoglogise to Jackie, I didn't mean any harm by that - it was, as Max said, very different years ago.  I wish I lived back then as well. For example, my favourite quote from Richard Branson's autiobiograhpy... "If nobody was working very well in the office we would all go out for a walk in Hyde Park. Somebody would fall in the lake and we would all go for a swim."  Can't do that any more. Bloody politcal correctness.

       Tom was probably generalising, meaning more detailed methods should go into practice, like beginning the year the campaign ads started or something.  There is something that I am wondering about though. Back in the 60's and before hand or whatever, we had no such things as AIDS or HIV or any of that rubbish. So what the f*** has happened to society?  The government are getting worse as we speak, go fascism and conservative. The world today is piss. I would have loved to live back in the 80's. I could have gone to college and expected something good to be on the radio instead of something crap. Thats just going off topic now.  NHS sucks, pity I have to live with it. I'm gonna wrap myself in cotton wool and try not to break my neck or anything.

       What you to have just said has really offended me, both my mother and father smoke, they started smoking when the dangers wernt known, and then got addicted So you 2 are saying that my parents shouldnt get any help if they go to hospital with a smoking related illness. THat in my opinion is FUCKED UP You 2 are probably coming from the point of veiw that neither of your parents smoke there fore it doesnt affect you, my parents still pay taxes and shit so why shouldnt they get health care for free? Bah And thoses so called hpercondriacs, well if they are known then they will be left until last on the waiting list evct, and for all you know thoses hypercondraites could have something seriously wrong with them, all they are doing is caring about their health. Gah, im in a really bad mood today so excuse the language But grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Boys are stoopid and should go to jail

       I've thought about this for many years, and I've always believed that you should only get free health care if it's not your fault. If you've been run over by a bus, sure, come on in, get it sorted. Been smoking for last 5 years and you can't breath? Money please. That seems fair to me. I have a jaw problem, it ain't my fault, it's just the way I was born - therefore I should be intitled to free health care. The only problem then is that people will start making things up and you'll get even more problems.  If you've got a problem, you've got a problem. I still don't understand how people can think they have a problem they don't, if anything it's usualy the other way round, there should be more people in hospital. Anyway, it does happen and I think people like that should be given little DIY hospital kits to take home and they can sit in their own bed and get their friends and family to play doctors and nurses.  I'm nuts.

       Well well well. I will find it hard to top Tom's rave but I will try.  Since we've been back at college this term I've been feeling sick. More sick each day. Then along some Friday and I can't do anything at school because I'm so busy trying not to be sick. So I get sent up but my form tytor. I come back at lunch thinking well I've had 3 hours kip so I shuld be okish now. I didn't make it to English. I sat in the common room trying not to be sick. I forced myself to textiles as I have a deadline next Friday and cannot afford to miss the lesson. Saturday. Didn't make it to work. Didn't do any work. Stayed in bed. Along comes Sunday. Made it to work for 2 hours then get sent home. Can't go to the cinema either, too ill.  Today I wake up thinking yea I feel better. Eat my breakfast. Bad move. I nearly throw up this time. Don't make it to school. I'm about to go to texiles in a moment simply because I have to do this work. I can't afford not to do it so matter how bad I feel. What really annoys me is the fact that I still haven't been sick! I wish I would be sick because then I'd feel soooo much better. Apparently there is a bug going around work anyway so hey, I'm definatly not making this up. The other annoying thing is on Sunday I could've Paul twice. But I didn't because I'm ill. Could've seen Paul for most of today. Can't. I'm ill. I hate being ill. Although it is rather nice when mum makes me soup and buys me jelly and things that are easy on the stomach. She even cut the crusts of my sandwiches. Marvellous.

       I can't sleep. I've tried sleeping on my back, I've tried sleeping on my front. Perhaps if I sleep on my right? No, I can see the clock now, counting down the hours. I'll sleep on my left. No, that doesn't work either. I'll read my book, a chapter or two. No, that didin't work. I'll listen to some relaxing music. Nope, that didn't help either. I'll go and get a drink of water. That was nice. I want some more water now. I can't sleep.  Let's have a moan about something. The music in our common room. First of all, nobody is really listening to it. When the hi-fi is taken away, everybody does what they always do which is chat. So even with music as loud as possible, everybody still chats; but the music is often so loud I can't hear myself think. Problem number two, the music that is played is shit. There is no other word that defines it, it just really is. Continus beats and some strange person talking over the top of it. So when the radio is put on rather than somebodies nasty CD, it's Kiss 100, which is also shit. Not as shit as some of the CDs people bring in, but still pretty shit. How about Radio 1? That plays music all day long that everybody will like. No? Alright, Capital FM? Too much pop? Alright, try Virgin. Not a chance; bunch of selfish bastards. Wait until the lower sixth become upper sixth, then we'll show 'em.  A thought has just come into my head. There are no real swear words. Let me explain; shit means poo, piss means just that, fuck means to plant a seed, wanker means to do that naughty thing boys do, bitch means female dog, bastard means your parents arn't married, prick means something sharp and pointy. There are no proper swear words! Even my own alternative, cabbages, means a green vegetable thing. I say we event a word that is purley for cursing with, a proper swear word. It has to be an all purpose word though, so it has to fit in the asterisks in the following: "**** off", "You stupid ******", "That's a load of ****", "Britney is such a *****", "I hate Justin, he's such a *******". So, all purpose, generaly insulting word; can't think of one, I'll try and go to sleep, I'm sure I'll think of something.

       Right ok I am here. Now I won't be able to reply with something full of facts and figures etc.. simply because I don't do any subject to do with stuff like that except general studies. And in general studies Max and I made a very sucessful presentation about it all. We came second in the polls. We voted for the communisits. I say send them to France simple because France - I dislike. Thats not a decent reason to say that I know but hey, thats me. Like I say before, I don't know that much about it all. I don't mind the seekers who happily pay there way and live quietly without causing problems. Thats fine. I understand about war countries and goverments pursuring people and stuff and yes its horrible for them which is why I say with the amount we'd save on the illegal ones being kicked out we could help those countries. Thats also a better way than sending in our army like Iraq. But hey, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I don't know all the ins and outs. I have no need to know really. Only time it bothers me is when I'm in Croydon and they're all around and its like ah get away. Yea, I guess what I'm saying is we should send the illegal immigrents away somewhere, anywhere, else and find another way of helping them.  Tomorrow  Jo  will be choosing subject/question.

People like Neil's grandmother, fine. They pay their way we are paying for their living expenses. They don't cause hassle but its just the ones who don't pay their way, who clutter up our country.  Liek I said before, simple solution: send them all to France.

       When you say immigrants, I am sure you mean illegal immigrants or illegal asylum seekers? If you want to kick out all immigrants you have to loose Neil. Neil's grandmother came over from India, she earns her living, she pays her taxes, she owns her own house. However, I do agree that illegal immigrants should not be allowed in the country, as it really is taking the piss now.  I have to disagree with point number 2. "Eighty-seven per cent of the population of England and 96 per cent of the population of Wales gave their ethnic origin as White British."  If they are going to come over here, they should speak English, they should get a job, they should earn a living not hang around Croydon late at night not doing a lot. If you thank that's mean, Croydon has higher amounts of Asian or black than the national average. For example, black or black British in Croydon is 13.3%, in the whole country 2.1%.   urlLink  Source: 2001 Census, ONS

       Reasons to kick immigrants out: - They take up valuable housing and jobs which could be taken by actual British people - True Brits are now a minority - They take our money, give nothing back  Think about the amounts of money we would save from husing and feeding them if we sent them away!! We may then be able to sort out our hospitals or provide more funding for police and things. Or with some of that money give it to the warn torn countries to help their people directly rather than sending them all here. They annoy me, I walk around Croydon and I feel uneasy. Partly because of the hoddlums around but partly because of them. I know they've come to start a new life etc... I know their countries may be war torn etc... but there are other ways of helping them. Soon Britian won't be Britain anymore.  Send them all to France. Let the French deal with them. They are a big enough country. That or at least make it a lot and I mean ALOT harder for them to get into this country.

But also hopefully with the expenses of living here we shoudl be able to kick the immigrents out. Wohoo.  I am not a happy bunny. I have been up since 4. I cannee sleep.

       One of the reasons why everything seems so expensive, especaily compared to the USA, is because we earn so little... Average annual income in the United States of America: US$34,280 Average annual income in Japan: US$35,610 Average annual income in the United Kingdom: US$25,120  Bastards.  I just watched a really good movie called 'Live From Baghdad' about the CNN news team in the first Gulf War; a really interesting and quite amazing movie, it's around on TV at the moment, look out for it, it's worth it. On the subject of Baghdad; Nicki, for my Christmas/birthday present got me The Baghdad Blog by Salam Pax, who wrote about the war from the city last year. I never read it online, but the book is great. Also I got a rather interesting book about the Matrix; my brain can't cope with too many books at one time, so I'll tell you more about it when I start reading it. So thanks Nicki!  I'm going to find some ice cream, and perhaps eat it.

        This week's topic: Why is Britian so high priced?   In France I see a little girl of about 9 go up to the counter and buy a pack of ciggies for what I worked out to be 1.15. Gap in america was cheap, I got one of my favourite polo necks from the store for only 2.50. Leather goods are so much cheaper as well.  For example, I want to buy a new motherboard for my PC. The one I want costs 85 in England. In the SAME STORE, but in the USA, it is 55. Why???

       Yep, I'm home. Home home home. I've had a lovelly time, a good break to get away from the pressures that all of us have. If you want to hear all the boring details come and talk to me. So today, I went shopping. In London. I bought lots of things.  urlLink Eddie Izzard - Sexie  (DVD), very funny!  urlLink Sugarcult - Start Static  (album), very good!  urlLink Black Eyed Peas - Shut Up  (single), just because that song's cool. I also bought a nice pair of jeans for 20 reduced from 50 in Gap - not bad at all! The main thing I went in for I didn't get because it's "out of season", grrrrrr. When I want to buy something, I want to buy it now, not when it's sunny, you silly people. Still, I also bought  urlLink Ministry of Sound Very Best of Chillout Sessions  which is very relaxing. So now, I'm off to bed.

       Taking a leaf out of Tom's mighty book I replace the word fuck or fucking with the word: cheese or cheesy.  So ner Matt NEEEEEEEEEEEER. And ner ner ner to the rest of the cheesy world. And whoever creates the Strong Bad website should be cheesy well shot alongside cheesy Chaucer for not creating a characters page for the cheesy brilliant 'eh steve' who was introduced to me tonight by Benjamin. Woo go Ben. Now I am in a cheesy cheesed off mood for many a reason. In fact my stupid cheesy mood has made me have a go at Charlene for no real cheesy reason and now I feel cheesy well bad about it so sorry to anyone I have bitched to today my apologies.  And I was going to write pages and more cheesy pages but to be honest I can cheesy well be cheesed.

       Croydon is a London Borough and is in the county of Surrey. Croydon is a town and so has a council. I live in Sanderstead, which is part of Croydon. Nicki lives in Hamsey Green, which is part of Croydon. Warlingham School is outside Croydon (by about 5 metres) and so is part of Surrey County Council. That is why we get Surrey ambulances at school and a mix of Surrey and MET police.  However, northern Croydon stops being Surrey and is part of the county of London, although never written like that. The City of London is actually quite small and covers between Westminster Bridge and Tower Bridge (or there about). The Queen, for example, does not live in the City of London, but lives in London.  The centre of London, such as Westminster and the City is very different. London then technically speaking becomes a county and Westminster is a City within London, hence the signs saying "City of Westminster". The towns around London, within Greater London, are part of the counties they are in, but the MET control the whole of Greater London.  However, Thornton Heath, which is in Croydon, is in the Surrey part, but it has a London postcode: SE19. However, other parts of Thornton Heath are in the Surrey part of Croydon and have CR7 for their postcode. Most of Surrey has Croydon postcodes; those living in Warlingham and Caterham with CR6 will know.  London Gatwick airport is quite far south in Surrey, but is London's second airport, with Heathrow being first. Gatwick is confusing because it spans Surrey and West Sussex - the airport being in the latter.  There are also constituencies to worry about as well. Warlingham School is in Tandridge, with Croydon to the north and Mid Sussex to the south. This is how the governments look at their national statistics. However, the constituencies within that are broken down even more.  I get BBC LDN for my local news, as I receive cable from Croydon and terrestrial from Crystal Palace (which is another town, although not very big, but is part of Croydon). People living in Tandridge should receive BBC South East as their local news  but I do not think any of us live that far to reach that news.  According the BBC and the office for National Statistics, Croydon is in London and Tandridge is in the South East.  My address is officially: Sanderstead, South Croydon, Surrey  because, on a map, that is exactly where I am.  There.

       Croydon is covered by the met police. I agree.  But then again I have an address saying "Croydon, Surrey" from my work experience. Its by thw Whitgift Centre. Surely can't be that not up-to-date can they?

       No Tom! Grr. LOL.  MATT: Technically Croydon is still London you fool. The council works differently. Croydon used to be a part of Surrey but it isn't anymore. Yes I know on peoples addresses they say Surrey like mine does but that is because its on the border. Plus there is a road the same name as mine in Croydon itself so by putting Surrey they know which one.  Croydon is a London Bourough, its South London. Just very very South. It is covered by the Met police, not the Surrey police.

       Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls let us give a proper El Bloggo invite to Matt! *silence* Wooo! the friendliness! Hey Matt all ya do is blog away!!!!!! Talk about what you wish and things. Most Mondays / Sundays someone posts a subject to discuss all week. There are a few basic rules which are: a) no blatant or however it is spelt promo for a website (cough david t cough) and b) no excessive swearing unless your in an incredibly evil / mad / depressed mood. Fair? I think so.  Well the ball last night was fab. Jackie, Matt and Max, you sooooo should've come! It wasn't really valentines influenced at all in fact it was just like the leavers ball except it was on a boat and there wasn't as much food. But it was soo good. I got Dean to buy me a drink, go me. It was so fun. Paul looked so loverly :) Everyone looked so loverly. I went to bluewater today with Lisa and my rents. I got some new shoes! And a few other things so it was a sucessful day in all.   Right now I am going to go and collaspe onto my bed after I have tided the chaos that is my room as it is in mayhem from getting ready yesterday. Rah.

       I feel that having 6 people would be too crazy if everyone were to be posting. It would be too much to catch up. I think that 5 people are enough. For now anyway.  I don't think there is any need to make people apply seeing as this is just a blog as has been pointed out. Looks like its going to be Matt is everyone ok with that?

At the end of the day once I am back from work I will be removing Jo from the member list unless she blogs so lets think up the next person to invite to join our blogging.

       I've done one exam this week. Technicaly two if you count general studies, but that doesn't really count. It was ICT and my hand got tired from writing, so combined with the fact that we walked into the exam blind having never seen an ICT AS paper I think I did pretty well; D if I'm lucky. Yay...  On to happy times.   Look what arrived today! Yay! I can listen to my tunes all day long.

       I think you should invite as many people as possible and see which people stand out and actually write something; so what if it's a frenzy of crazy stuff, it will be quite a contrast.  I don't like Rousseau, I think he's a bit of a ponce. And he's French, which doesn't help.

       Ok so this blog is really starting lag. Now I think it would be a good idea to add someone else in so please give me your suggestions and please blog.

Why is it that the day when your all supposed to be home faffing around your mother, giving her presents etc... that instead the Britsh all come out to Woolworths? Why is it that people don't buy cards or presents until the day they are needed? Why is it that everyone is buying their mother either Calendar Girls or Love Actually?? Seriously! We'vce sold like 10 copies of LA today already!!!!!!! Aaaah!!!  The thing that is most insane about today is that our old manager Pam booked Charlene and Dean a day off today. They are both off. Leaving us with 4 people in house until 2 when Lora goes. Leaving us with 3. 3 people. 2 people to work 3 tills which we refuse to do because you need at least noe person running around when needed but at the same time we have to do the charts etc... AAAAAAAAAAH.

       When things like this happen it makes you question humanity.  And its a shame. It does need to stop. Completely. But it won't.  I am going to Spain in roughly 3 weeks. I hope everything is OK.   I have a dent in my head above my eye from where I hit my head on the corner of the corner seat yesterday. Grrr. Then i had to go to work. To do the delivery. But it didn't even turn up. Which is good because that means not much work this weekend. Hehe. But it meant I kinda wasted 2 hours (paid though) when I could've gone and joined in with the quiz night. Grr. Fine.

       I am just disgusted. I can't express with words what my family and I feel today. My condolences to the families of the people that today said goodbye for the last time. God bless you.  Nuria, Alcal de Henares, Madrid, Spain   I would like to send my condolences to all family's victims. I'll pray for them tonight. God bless them.  talo Cavalcanti, Fortaleza, Brazil   I can't believe it! All this horror! For what? When will it end?  Jonathon Tong, Madrid, Spain   Has anyone realised that the bomb blast in Madrid was on the 11th March, six months from 11th September. Is it coincidence, or perhaps a deliberate plan on the part of the terrorists?  Julie Oswald, Northumberland   As a person who grew up and lives in NYC, I wanted to let the people of Madrid, Spain to know that our prayers are with them.  Dennis Lee, New York, USA   My son age 16 called from Alcala De Henares to say he was ok. He is on a trip with 7 other students studying at the international school there for 2 weeks from Texas. Our small town in Texas sends our sympathy and our prayers for all the people and country of Spain. My son said it is a horrible tragedy like our 9/11 was to our country. We may be from different countries but we are all family created by our father. We are mourning now with you Spain.   Lynda Pohl, Belton, Texas U.S.A.   We just want peace and justice.

       This is starting to turn into a one person blog.... :(  How do you think the music issue is coming along then? I thought yesterday lunch was quite funny with yet another fight which consisted of Bradley v me, Eddie and Colette. It was funny mainly becauise their argument consists of 'fuck off'. Nice. I had the best lunch today. I spent the whole hour cuddling Paul and it was so nice. :)  Jackie has new shoes!!!!!

       Matt has officially been removed now from this blog and I reckon at least 5 people would be better than 4 as not everyone blogs that much if you see what I mean so again if you have anyone you would like to join this nominate them.  I ust got in from work and I am sooo tired. I ache all over because I've been doing delivery today and its all very heavy. VERY heavy. Tomorrow I'm doing full day then 2 nights during the week. I would say gah but I actually volunteered for extra hours. Next Saturday I have swapped shifts so I'm working afternoon so I get a lie in. Woo! I feel so bad when I moan about feeling tired after a 4 hour shift. Well, 4 and half. Especially when people like Paul work all day! Like proper all day. Awww. I see Paul tomorrow. Wooo! :P

       Wooooooo! Discussion! People blogging! Wooooo!!!  Well I'll admitit, at teh begining of the year I really didn't mind Joe putting his CD's on, i didn't mind listening to kiss all day. I admit some of the songs were good. Even got my feet tapping away but now I'm totally against it all mainly because of the way its been handled. I wouldn't mind Joe putting his CD's on if he asked everyone first 'Does anyone mind if I change the CD?' or if he waited for the actual CD to finish but he doesn't. He just goes and turns it off whenever he pleases, like its HIS stereo and it isn't. Its everyones. I know poeple have different tastes, lok at my CD collection. I own a bit of everything. Pop, Rock, RnB, Soundtracks, Jazz atc... I don't mind what we listen to I just wish it was dealt with in a better way. But I agree, the best solutionis simply no stereo at all. When they took it away for a week the common room was so much better. You could hear yourself think, you could have conversation with people without shouting and no one got wound up for people changing the CD or radio station. Yes, I vote too,  Get rid of the CD player . If people want to listen to stuff they can bring in their own personal stereos.  I saw the drama plays last night. WOW. I am so proud of everyone who was in them :) Only thing that annoyed me slightly was that they decided to tell me as we were all leaving that I was invited to Pizza Express with them as the drama group were going. Grrr. Tell me a few days before and I can get money. Tell me five minutes before and gah. Ah well. That doesn't matter anyway, the plays were sooo good and I would say more but I have to go to work so byeee.

       I agree with Jackie; nobody really listens to it anyway, and most people have their own music anyway - it just causes problems. I think we should get rid of it, the atmosphere is always much more pleasant without it.

       Hm, I will listen to practically anything... But especailly Justin Timberlake! Tee Hee Joe's music to me is okay, but i dont want to listen to it everyday, the same goes for the kinda stuff the grungers listen to. I prefer pop type songs or ones with beats and lyrics, such as songs from blue, westlife, ect The problem is easy, get rid of the stereo, if someone wants to listen to music, play it in a personal player ect... simple

       My tastes in music vary, but only slightly. I like all kinds of 'rock'. Yes, it is classified under 'rock', but there are different styles like 'classic rock' (e.g. Beatles), nu-metal (Rage against the machine), Hard rock (e.g. Guns N Roses), progressive rock (Pink Floyd). I also like quite a bit of 80's stuff, including classic 80's pop tracks.  Now, the common room......I reckon the days should be spilt over the two weeks and divided into 'sections'. One music 'style' should be played per day. One being Kiss radio, one being rock that the majority of the grungers like, and the other 'defined' styles like Rap, House, Garage, Living room, utility room, bedroom, front porch, larder storage, or whatever other music like that there is.  Splitting is the only fair way to control both sides. By me saying 'both sides' I mean Joe vs. Simon/Charlie vs. Rest of 6th form. (using as an example because they have two completely different music tastes).  Also. What struck me is....that music that is always being played gets turned off or changed. For example, that Pokemon song, nobody turned it off and it has been played three times that I have heard. I reckon nobody turned it off because it was a CHANGE. Something that nobody has heard for ages.

       I like music. I enjoy listening to all music, considering the differences and appreciating the different styles around the world and in all the cultures. This is something which most people really cannot do as they live in their shallow world of only listening to one style of music, which quite frankly, bores me to tears. My brother and Paul have this habit in the mornings, getting ready to go to school, of only listening to rock, and if it is not rock or a song that they have not heard before or is not to there usual taste, will straight away change the channel. At all costs, they will watch Kerrang! or Q. If a song, for example like this morning, came on by Oasis then thats not rock enough for David and Paul so they want to watch something else. Both of them call all other styles of music crap, rubbish or just bad. It is not bad music at all, they just live in a shallow world.  How about listening to new music rather than sitting in your shallow musical worlds and listen to the other music out there? I do enjoy rock, I really have no problem with it, its one of my favourite styles, but I also enjoy all other types of music.  This kind of behaviour is very similar to Joe, he enjoys his particular type music; however Joe expresses it in the different manner: by inflicting it on the rest of the 6th form who really, do not care for it at all. I do not mind listening to Kiss (being the most popular in the common room), they play some good songs that obviously Virgin would never play. Most people seem to be happy, everybody has their personal favourite, but as far as pleasing as many as possible a combination of Kiss and Capital, with Virgin after school, seems to be fine.  However, Joes music is where  urlLink music , defined as  urlLink an artistic form of auditory communication incorporating instrumental or vocal tones in a structured and continuous manner  stops being music. His music gives me head aches, he always plays the same songs, and he doesnt give a flying fuck about what anybody else thinks. The continuous beats with some bloke who probably mugged some kid on the way to record the song. Joe does not even buy the songs; all those CDs are burnt and obviously the songs have been stolen through the Internet. If you support and enjoy music, buy the bloody song.  Tomorrow I am going to buy the Britney Spears single Toxic. Why? I like the song, it has a fabulous violin part, which is ringing around in my head, it has interesting lyrics, to me it is a good song, just like when I bought Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas. If any of you think buying either of them is sad, pathetic, stupid, silly or whatever - you can go fuck yourself. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music and deciding on what I want to listen to, not what an industry wants me to listen to or sitting in a shallow world of a mono-style.

       So. This is an interesting conversation. . . .  Um yea so I went Croydon with Ben to give advice on presents he was buying. We had dinner at Pizza Hut which was cool. We had a giggle. Er what else. Um. Just had a wicked shower. Nice and waaaarm which was cool. Lol. Um, I miss Paul :( Lots of mayhem going on on msn atm. I should really go do some work. Gah. I am now working all day Sunday and probably some evenings after school next week. Most evenings actually. Which is good because of money and this time if I am knackered or whatever I'm just not going to moan because it annoys people so. Yea.  Good advice dudes: Listen to your heart. Yea.  Um seeing as no one is really blogging I'll post a subject thingy for now in case someone wants something specific to blog about:  The music problem in the common room

       Just to clarify I spent most of yesterday having a go at most people so don't feel hard done by. Yea I know you have work, so does everyone else but it only takes a few minutes to write a few lines. And both of you type fast so, um, yea.  But anyway. I have noticed that on tusedays when Paul is at work I actually come home and get on with work rather than sitting on msn until he comes on. LOL. So now I have nearly finished a wall hanging. Only 2 things left to finish for textiles which I should be able to do by Friday. But now I have about 3/4 pieces for art to finish so, um, pants.

You don't know what goes on in my life behind the name of   Max  eMac Fund: 322 of 756 - November Rain (http://www.maxpayne.co.uk)  so please don't have a go at me. Nicki knows the reasons why im not blogging why I should. I've told her and I've requested something to be done about it. It isnt my fault.  Other than I have blisters on the back of both feet from walking home all the time, i'm whoop-de-doo. Seriosuly.  The parents have stolen the computer room, meaning I am downgraded to the 400Mhz laptop. Pathetic. I need my own PC for my room. One that I can modify and build to my own specification without anybody hindering me in the process.

       Oh for fucks sake. Re-reading that it sounds like I am having a go at Paul for staying late. I'm not. Just better clarify that point. I'm not.  Ahhhhhhhh I wanna go beat someone. Ooo lets get Joe the flannelt wearer! He is really starting to pee me off. What a man bitch. Lets give him a bitch slap.   I have decided I want a mini. A proper nice mini, I want some mini adventures.  I have also decided that I can't be arsed to be unhappy anymore while actually at school because it just pisses everyone else off so I will be 'happy' and I won't annoy you all, that much. I say that much because I am sure I will annoy you at some point for some reasons and oh my gosh Tom is strong he can pick me up and carry me. He carried me across the common room earlier. So did Rudland. I was amazed.   But enough of that.  BRB I got chocolate to go get. . . . . . . . . . . . Ok I'mback and now I am eating chocolate which I shouldn't because eating chocolate makes you insanely fat. Well not you, me. I once wanted to be a model. Pah. Good dream that was. You gotta be thin to do that.  Fucking bloody quality street. I mean what a total rip off. They are tiny now. Not the good nice big one we used to get. Now they are tiny. Little fuckers.  I want the YMCA on cd because I want to go cheer myself up but I can't because I don't have it on CD and nor do I have Buttercup on cd and I can't be bothered to do much else except moan on here so you can put up with it.  Actually I can't even be bothered to moan now. I think I'm gonna go sit on msn and annoy whoever is online. Lets have a look.. Lisa. Nah I won't annoy her. Max. Oi Max blog biatch. Ant. Hmmm. I haven't spoken to him in a while. Maybe. Jason. Nah don't speak to him much. Jane. Nah. Although she is fun to annoy. Charlie. No I like Charlie. Me. No I won't annoy myself oh wait too late already have. Eddie. Nah. Too much effort that. Lora. Nah. an no one else is online because THEY ARE ALL DOING DRAMA. I really want to watch the Sound Of Music but my sister has the video so ahh. Maybe i will go watch Sister Act 2? Who knows??  Or maybe I will just sit here and FUME.

       ARRRRRRGH. Look people do you think you can blog? Otherwise there really is no point in this. I get the impression Tom you aren't happy now that Jo has gone because you blog like NEVER. And Max: your like online all the bloody time so just fucking blog. Am I in a good mood? NO I AM FUCKING WELL NOT. Its fucking freezing and I have been at school until 5 mins ago waiting for Paul who is STILL in drama and yes fine reherse but i have been there since fucking 3.35!!!!!! And now I am incredibly pissed off because I spent the last like half hour waiting as on actually waiting. Doing NOTHING. I had no homework left to do or anything and its just like ahhh. Why I am always waiting for other people?? This isn't directed at anyone, I just don't get why I am the one always waiting for people, waiting for everyone else Ack. And I haven't seen Paul today hardly. Lunch he was doing some prefect thing and then now hes still in drama so argh. So I am not impressed and I just want to see him but apparently not. So wopee. So tomorrow I think I may just sleep all of fucking lunch. Sorry for my language but I'm pissed off at many many things.  Have a good evening.

       Hi everyone, another exausting and fairly stressful week comes to a close. This week for me has contained good and bad days, so overall it was a boreing week, lots of reminders to do things i should have done 5 weeks ago. Is it me or is every teacher in the school currently having a go at 6th form classes??? Grrrrrr makes me angry, and then this morning i walk into school and who is waiting for me at the door, that lovly lady, Miss SHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just waiting to pounce on me and have a go for missing her lesson, grrrr. Anyway a nice long weekend to follow. I want to propose a rule that no one does any school related work on bank holiday Monday? anyone with me? Well i am sorry this isnt very exciting today, talk to you all soon, have a briliant long weekend. Oh the life moto thing,  'Expect the best, but prepare for the worst' Dave

        If you want a job done properly, do it yourself.  I would never let my Dad perform maintenance on these PC's, as he would bugger it up before you can say 'cheese'.  A massive W00T because Waitrose have kept me on file from January when I applied, and they are now recruiting and have chosen me and a few other people to attend an interview on Saturday at 2:30.  Have yet another computer upgrade request from a girl called Eolie in year 11. Another w00t. Selling my AIO printer for 30. W00t again.  The course I want to take at university will be one of: (BSc) Computer Architecture And Design (BSc) Computer Systems Engineering (BSc) Computer Systems  Sometimes they are Hons, sometimes they are not.

       I don't really have a motto, and anything I do tend to say a lot, I usually steal ou of songs. Just general inspiring things. Here's one of my favourites. Its more a speech really, but I love it:  "Everyday a man wakes up And everyday a man tries to pour himself a cup of coffee, And take a good long hard look in the mirror. Sometimes what he sees in that mirror he doesn't like, And sometimes what he sees makes him angry,  and sometime what he sees makes him sad. Sometimes what he sees is himself And that dissapointment just gets into you and rips you out, Little be little, piece by piece.  And sometimes you can just lay down You can just play the game You can take the cards that they deal you And you can just pretend it's all over... ....BUT NOT ME"

       I know your all busy but could you guys do a quick post please. Thanks.   What is your motto and why?  Mine is 'it's never as bad as being shot in the neck, unless you have been shot in the neck'. Why? Because I watched a program and it showed someone as they were and then after they had been shot in the neck and it is horrid. You take a while to die, they can't save you (depending where bullet is but higher percentage of not saving), and you die a slow death by drowning in your own blood. It's horrid so it can't be as bad as that.   What about you all?

GOOD LORD WHY DID I TAKE ELECTRONICS. and today sunday, i spent at AMF partly to see my mate, mainly to attend my cousins birthday party (she is 5) that was all very good fun, and while i was there i broke my current ten pin bowling top score (which now stands at 141) (without barriers) as if any of you actually care! Anyway i have to sleep now, another great day of school to dream about tommrow. Talk to you all soon. Dave

       Well actually Tom, that isn't the course at that uni I was looking. And I  do  need to do a foundation course because that if how you build up a decent portfolio and please stop trying to tell me I'm wrong. I am quite happy with the way I am handling it, I have spoken to my art teacher and she actually said do the foundation course because you get to experience new arts and stuff.  If you say any more about it without me asking you do you know this or do you know that I'm gonna get really annoyed even though I already am quite annoyed because I don't appreciate people telling me me own ideas especially when you don't even want to do fashion design or something along those lines I think I would know a little more about the fashion courses. Sorry if that sounds rude but this term I am very pissed off at people copying my ideas and trying to tell me what to do. I am my own person you know. I can do stuff myself without people telling me or then copying me.

        urlLink BA (Hons) Fashion Design  Entry requirements: A good portfolio plus  one  of the following:  Successful completion of a foundation course in art and design together with five GCSE passes at grade C or above.  A merit profile at BTEC National Diploma level in a relevant subject together with five GCSE passes at grade C or above.  240 points at A/AS and/or Vocational Advanced level qualification. Candidates will normally have successfully completed two 6-unit qualifications or an appropriate 12-unit Vocational Advanced qualification (AVCE). The School does not usually accept General Studies as a qualification.  Equivalent qualifications or experience.  As you can see Nicki, you  don't  need to do a foundation course.

       Actually Tom I  do  need to do a foundation. I have looked at the courses I want and they all require a portfolio and a foundation dipolma thing some of which the unis actually allow you to do there and then go on to the course so actually Tom for me personally it is not optional and when I asked them about it they said you could apply without a portfolio but you'd have a much better chance of getting in with one seeing as one of the courses only has 45 places on it so yes, I do need a foundation course and portfolio. I can't even remember what the unis are. Only one I can remember is Nottingham Trent uni.  Cool Jackie I was planning on wearing a skirt as well!!! Lol. So hey we can be skirt buddies? lol. What skirt is it? Short skirt? Long skirt? Denim?

       Er right Tom... No problem Paul :p Max, you deserved it.   The Butterfly Effect , sunday, films starts at 6.00. See you in the screen if you wish you come.  So I got the weekend off. Yay! I spent today cleaning my room and looking through the "propecti" (LOL). Gah. If I choose to do an art or fashion course I have to do a foundation diploma degree thingy. Which is good because I'll have an extra qualification but still. Gah.

Its pretty crazy. Was pondering buying one myself and bringing it to school as stress exam relief. Could work could work.  So the vending machines are sold out and don't work. Thats like not good.

       Hi, Tom - i can tell you the three digit firgure was over 100.  Nicki - in order to lay this whole gay thing to rest, i think we can come to the aggreement that the use of the word is wrong, when in the context of a way of describing something which is bad.  My day has been pretty depressing compared to the great holiday, but thats life. Hopefully tommrow will be better. talk to you all soon Dave

       The word  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  springs to mind.  Now I believe I have mentioned the fact that my computer died and wiped all my work off including work shadowing letters? Well. The printer wasn'tworking this morning so I stayed after school to write the letter on the comps there but of course all our passwords were changed to numbers and I don't know my number so I couldn't get in so I am attempting to write it now but my computer is being very tempermental so lets beat it up. Yuss!

       Hmmm... The work i was doing last night, I have now found out did NOT have to be finished, so now I am majorly pissed off.. I have now got 4 fucking pieces of fucking coursework to be finished by the end of next week. So I probably won't be talking much on msn. Today was crap, I want the summer holidays to come!  And I wish them bloody kids would stop setting the fire alarm off.

       This whole 'gay' thing. I get pissed off when people say it as well, I know lots of gay people, some get annoyed others don't. I don't mean to offend anyone but I've given up pointing out exactly what you point out because no one listens and no one stops saying it. Its not as if I sit there and actually mean the computer is homosexual. Blame it on the society we live in today. Everyone says 'proper good' and 'gay' as general terms now. I really don't think people are out to annoy you. So sorry for saying it but my computer really is the most annoyinly bitch ever. IT NOW TURNS ITSELF ON RANDOMLY. WTF is up with that???? So bad to start to a worse day. I couldn't find half my book sthis morning and paniced. Wooooooooo! I have a full days of lessons today, I am supposed to bring all my stuff in but to frank with you I cannot physically carry 3 folders, 3 sketch boks and about a hundred other random books in because I will DIE.

       Hi, Its late, and i am not gonna write a full essay. a couple of things i would like to bring up. Paul - If you wanna argue about it, then we will arrange to meet up some time and i will quiet happily go into it further. Crispy - i put on 3 pound, and my dad put on 4! Today i went to work on some lights at AMF, i have just finished typing their invoice which (i cant say the amount online) but i have made a 3 digit figure, lump sum out of my work there, and i am very happy. After i finished there i went to waynes and spent some time with him, fixed a computer came home, typed stuff for AMF. Looking forward to school which starts in 8 hours from now!!! Brilliant stuff. Talk to you all soon. Dave

       Dave- calling something gay is really no different from calling someone a bastard... it doesn't mean that they are really an illegitimately born child does it? And I'm sure people who were really born when their parents weren't married aren't gonna take offence at the term

       Well I should of gone into school today to hand in coursework. But considering I haven't finished it I thought I better not. I will finish it today and hand it in tomorrow. She can't get that angry at me because I know some people arn't handing it in until tomorrow anyway.  I have got to babysit tonight which means an extra 5 to spend, Although I just remebered I owe Nicki 2 or 3. As she brought me a train ticket and I never paid her the full ammount back.  I had a huge fright this morning because my mum phoned from work saying are you sure you haven't got school. Now I was thinking that the teacher I was seeing today had phoned up, but in fact all it was, was that when my mum drove to work she saw all of the cars in the school car park. Forrtuantly I told her all the teachers had to go in, so the scare was avoided.  To david- I wonder whether you put on any weight? And also what did you spend your winnings on? I hope it was something for me.  Wow, I can't beleive I am making such huge posts recently! Maybe it's because I am putting off doing work if I type long things?

       Hi everyone, After having a great time reading your posts I have a few comments to make, One - Nicki - Computers are as of yet mechanical devices, they do (supposedly) what we tell them to, there is no way in the world that your computer or any other computer could be homosexual. I get fairly pissed off when everyone uses gay as a term for something people don't like, WHY DO IT. I know loads of gay people, and i know it offends some of them, and I don't think its fair. (sorry if it seems like I am having a go, don't mean to) Two - Paul (and anyone else who don't know) - I do now have a girlfriend (believe it or not) She is called Becky Aspland, I have been with her for about a week, she goes to Archbishop Tennisons, is nice, what else can I say?   Ok now on to my day, my plan for today was to get up early sort out the 100000000 hours worth of coursework I had to do and sort out my life, a very time consuming activity. However as life is life, things didn't go to plan, not at all. I got up at 10:30 sort early compared to 2pm. So instead of doing work I played Transport Tycoon,  Then I decided I should eat (here's the start of the most stupid thing I have done for ages) My mum decided she would make me and my dad a fry up, we had too much bacon (I don't know why?) so she gave me and my dad 5 'bits' each, as we ate it we talked about weight watchers (which my mum does) we discovered that me and my dad would only be able to eat 18 points each day, my mum worked out how many would be in our breakfasts, and then we decided to keep a track of everything we ate today, this stupidly soon turned into a competition, however not who could stick to 18 but who could eat the most points during today. Well this has got really out of hand, we are both nearly throwing up at each move we make but are still eating to try and win the massive 1 reward. ITS VERY SILLY DON'T DO IT. Anyway now I am watching 'what lies beneath' actually I am not I am watching, my brother watching 'what lies beneath' (he is scared!!!!!!!)  Anyway have got to go prepare my equipment for tomorrows, low work, high pay, work at AMF. Looking forward to that one, but now looking forward to waking up at 8:30, Anyway hope everyone is good, (sorry if I have wrote loads,don't wanna strain anyone's eyes or something like that)  See you all soon, Dave

       I guess I should blog really as I haven't for the past few days. Its possibly because I am addicted to www.habboforum.com at the moment. Not something I am proud of.  As yet I have done no school work, which means tongiht and tomorrow I have an awful lot of work to do. I have three peices of coursework to be done and numerious peices of homework. I have done no revision or even looked at any of my work.   I feel that I may be retaking my exams... the fact is, I have no urge to do any work. To me it is boring and I always find better things to do, such as habboforum.  The holidays have been quite good, Been to Thorpe park, Brighton and the cinema, But thats about it. I would of liked to go to the cinema  again, but most people either can't be bothered to come, have no money, or they have too much work to do.  One last thing, I have now recieved my skirt for work, so I am now wearing a skirt, If you wish to laugh go ahead. Fortuantly i may be allowed to wear trousers as we had a little talk about equal opportunities and equal rights... :D  So this is my blog, I may not blog much for the rest of the week as I will be extreemly busy finishing off coursework and doing homework. Goodbye.

       She doesn't mean disabled people driving silly. I doubt you're going to spend 1 hour in a disabled toilet, so I guess it's alright to use for a quick piss.  The sex thing: because it's mucked up, like all the other 16/18 laws.  Right, remember the Music Video thing? Well there is now a Web site for it at  urlLink www.snooboo.com/musicvideo . This is mainly directed at Paul, but everybody else is welcome to make suggestions and things.  snooboo.com Forum as well as a lot of other snooboo.com things all got mucked up while I was away, which isn't much fun.  Anywho, back to blogging; I found this on CNN:  urlLink Strangest taxes . This one is the best: Illegal drug tax: At least 11 states, including Alabama, North Carolina and Nevada, tax people who possess illegal drugs. Usually, though, you have to be in possession of a minimum quantity (for example, over 42.5 grams of marijuana in North Carolina) to be subject to the tax.  But no need to wait for the police to cuff you before you cough up the cash. In North Carolina, for instance, when you acquire an illegal drug (or even "moonshine"), you can go to the Department of Revenue and pay your tax, in exchange for which you'll receive stamps to affix to your illegal substance. The stamps serve as evidence you paid the tax on the illegal product.  Don't worry that you might get in trouble for admitting you have enough drugs to fuel a rave party for years. You needn't provide any identification to get the stamps and it's illegal for revenue employees to rat you out.  Still, according to North Carolina's department charged with collecting the unauthorized substance tax, only 77 folks have voluntarily come forward since 1990. Most of them are thought to be stamp collectors. (Or perhaps they were just high?)  The majority of the $78.3 million the state has collected thus far has come from those who got busted and were found without stamps.  But even if they had had stamps, it's not like their legal troubles would be over. "Purchasing stamps only fulfills your civil unauthorized substance tax obligation," according to the N.C. DOR Web site. Only in the strange land that we call America.

       I didn't know you had a girlfriend Dave. Who is she?  Right, answering Nicki's question about disabled people, I guess its more dangerous for a disabled person to be behind the wheel of a car than it is for them to be on a toilet. Although that said, look at how Elvis died. Toilets are dangerous creatures they are  Here's a question:  At the age of 16, you are legally allowed to have sex, yet cannot watch images of a strong sexual nature on film until you are 18. Why?

       Hiya, Nicki - Sounds great although around school shows things often get a bit tense. But as long as you can stand everyone in a stress and the boss lady thinks its ok then cool.  Paul - I have seen the way you look at me  Right, today i took out my girlfriend to Croydon, we looked in strange shops then went to pizza hut, then went to see 50 first dates, (was fairly good but was one of them typical films where you can predict the end from the start!) Then i went to her house to 'meet the parents' and i dont think i should make a comment about that so publicly. Anyway then when i got home wayne gave me a call and said do ya wanna come bowling so i said yea course. So then i had to go back to gf 'Becky's house and pick her up then we spent the evenign bowling. Just got home, didnt win, far from it. (i am sure it was a computer related problem and nothing to do with how i bowl) Anyway most of you seem to be writing short messages, and i can really go on when i want to so i think i will now finish, (you dont all wanna know about my strange and mucked up life) So looks like i am gonna watch the rest of this film (on BBC1, not bad actually, comic moments) Then go to bed, hope you are all well, and see you all tuesday!

       Yay! Hi Dave *waves*. We discovered blogger doesn't like hotmail or hotmail doesn't like blogger. One of the two. Oh yea, I had a brainstorm. When the school play is on if you want, I could always come and keep you company on the balcony..each night. Then I could like watch Paul each night....and keep you tech dudes company. Sounds like a plan to me. Your choice....  Righteho. I have work 9.30 - 1.30 today. Not sure if that is good or not. I like the fact I have been given a pay rise, that actually makes me work harder amazingly. Might run into Croydon after work to purchase some things.  Have a go at this one:  Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but its ok to use a handicapped toilet?

        HI EVERYONE  Right after approximately 1000000000000000 invites from nicki finally one has worked and i am back with you guys!  Looking through the last few posts i am fairly concerned with what i have to live up with, and hope my meaningless comments and sexual innuendos will be good enough for this sacred blogg.  My day today has been relatively boring and no where near exciting enough to mention here, overall this week for me has been absolutely brilliant and a much needed break, the amount of work i have got through and the pain and sweat i have put into all my subjects 18 hours a day has been totally and completely unbelievable. (and indeed you may choose not to believe that). Anyway i must now go and stare aimlessly at the motorola ICOM 2 way radios, because i am like that. Hope you are all having a great holiday and i will be back soon. Dave  (also known as, David, David Thomas, The new boy on the block, Sexy, sex bomb, as well as some others which will remain undisclosed)

       Some more things to educate you guys about. Goths. Did you know there are sterotypes of goths? No? Yes? I'll tell you about them anyway;   Romantic Goth   attitude: My capacity for love is certainly greater than this mortal coil can bear.  clothes: Anything with lace and frills: Edwardian, Victorian, renaissance.

       Yes Tom Yes, English Spag Bol. Hope your trip to Cornwall was fun. Sorry I didn't actually realise who you were on the train. Lol. It was pretty early.  So yesterday some of us went to Brighton which were (if you didn't know) Me, Paul, Jackie, Matt W, Dave Edwards, Char, Jenna, Jenny and Sarah.  Was lots of fun, except I got burnt. Damm the sun. I also managed to get us a bit lost but the less said about that the better... Day before that I did teh Hard Rock Cafe and theatre with Paul and omg it rocked so much and we are so doing that in the summer Paul. I'm gonna take you to see Jailhouse Rock or something. :p  Today I shall spend it working. Right now I can't do any as all my books are wet with paint and will take a few hours to dry. Wopee!!!

       In the process of looking up the anwser to this question I have discovered that the worker bee in the hive is worked to death! Outrageous! I vote we stage a revolution for them all. Mind you, what do you expect when the Queen bee kills her mother and any siblings. The 'drone' bee has it all, all HE does is mate with the Queen bee. Lucky him.  I have found out how bees have sex, read below:  The mating flight follows a pattern. The virgin queen flies to a congregation area where hundreds or thousands of unrelated drones await. The drones pursue the queen and several mate with her in flight. The drone mounts the queen, inserts his endophallus, and ejaculates his semen. During ejaculation, the male falls back and his endophallus is ripped out of his body and remains attached to the queen. Drones mounting later remove the previous drone's endophallus and lose their own through similar matings. The emasculated drones die very quickly with their abdomens burst in this fashion.   Um, interesting. And if you could see the diagrams I do then you shall see that the male bee looses his stinger. I wonder then if they do actually sting each other? So not that anyone wanted to know any of that but there you go! That is how bees have sex.

       Today was interesting. Got up at 10 and went to see Gothika with Dave/Rich/Rob and a few other people. It's a good scary film, actually makes you jump unlike some of the others. Then we went for Pizza Hut, I only had one slice of pizza because I was too full up from the large popcorn and Coke from the cinema.  Plan for the week: Tues - Homework Wed - Fix Andy's PC Thurs - See Lora Fri - Homework Sat/Sun/Mon - At Nan's. Tues - School Wed - School Thurs - University Trip Thing Fri - School.

       To Jackie: I am alright thank you. I've just worked all day for the third time since Friday. Marvellous. Now my legs ache. How are you? How is everyone?  The Meaning of life.... who says there is one? Life doesn't have a set meaning. Life is a journey, not a destination. Guess it also depends if you believe in the afterlife. If you do, the meaning of life will probably be to lead a good life. If you don't, then the meaning of life is just to makea s much of your life as you can. But nah, there is no 'meaning to life'

       The joys of England which you do not realise until you have been away. English number plates. English crows. English pigeons. English sausages. English spag bol. English language. English people in general. English rain. English chips! English shower. English home. English road. English left side driving on the English road. etc.....  I've decided from my Barcelona trip that I dislike the French, and France. Quite a lot. So its not good really when I am going on next years art trip (most likely, ie: Phillips said: of course you can come, you can do what you like) (woo!!!!) to the South Of France. Gah.   What is everyone up to this weekend? I'm working 9.30 - 6.00 today and 10.00 - 2.00 tomorrow even though we are shut. Lol.   Have a good day.

       Perhaps your not making sense with being busy yet not a lot has happened. Perhaps your overreacting. Perhaps your not being told your wrong. Perhaps people disagree but perhaps because of that it makes a discussion / debate.  Wooo! I get paid 4.20 now! Wooo!

       I got back from Barcelona yesterday. I was like yay lets go read El Bloggo and catch up with what people have been doing this past week. Jackie tided her room. Thats it.  Thanks for blogging everyone. Your really keeping up the point of a group blog. I'm going to now invite some random people to join this so tough if you don't like them or whatever, its not as if anyone has given any suggestions. I'm going to invite:  Dave T (give him a re-try), Paul, Andy See how they work with this and then maybe some more depending how many people actually blog.  For now; I had a good time in Barcelona. Not that anyone has really asked. Except Paul. Then again I did see him yesterday. Or Matt. He asked. Thats about it really.

       Hiya, Feeling beeter today, my best mates birthday, had a bit of a party was good fun, chance to losen up a bit. Thanks alot of depriving me of my exam time relief PAUL, grrrrr i was really looking foward to that extra week!!! Glad you finally found a bus anyway. I remain annoyed with pennie, but am genrally happier now so its all good. Hope you all had a good bank holiday, and i hope you all have a good week.  Talk to you all soon, Dave

       I see what you are saying Dave. I have noticed that they never come to the commmon room anymore to see everyone. Look back to year 11 and how big the groyup of friends. How when people organised the park just about everyone went. This year I have hardly seen Pennie. When I do she is with Stuart and they never part so I don't get any time to talk to her. I see Helen in textiles, when she turns up.  I would've gone down yesterday but I didn't finish work until 4.30ish and it was raining at the time. I also rang Pennie to check they were there and they had moved from the park into Helens shed. I had asked Pennie the day before to text me if they left the park so I knew where they were. That has annoyed me alot. She never remembers to tell me if they are somewhere else, or if she can't make it etc... I find it really rude.  But hopefully in the summer we can all down the park and if everyone mucks in in sending out the emails and stuff we'll all get there. Just I guess now we gotta work around when people are actually at work.  Talking of work. I'll be working today from 9 until 6 so if anyone feels like a walk come on up to woolies and buy yourselves some Cd's or sweets or toys or stationary or kitchenware. You know you want to. Actually you don't have to. Lol. In fact I want you all to stay home and have a lie in and have fun.  Have a nice day.

       Deep Dave, deep. We didn't go in the end, because they'd all wandered off by the time I finally made it there. I did start walking by the way, or running anyway, and a bus came and picked me up eventually :)  By the way Dave, I owe you an apology, I was wrong about the extra week, there isn't one. Looks like its time to start those drama notes now old chap!

       Hi, I did go to the park, and it did chuck it down with rain, and i didnt stay long, and today taught me something.  It dont matter how much money you have or what you can do in life, friends are f****** important to everyones happieness and those who dont have them are sad people. Pennie and Helen used to be popular people, but although they spent alot of money tried hard and pulled out all the stops to make today good, they simply dont have enough people who care about them to make it a sucess. If more people were there it would have been fun, they have thought about themselves too much this year and have ended up in an unfortunate situation (mainly pennie). Today has made me realise how important my friends are to me, especially my best friend and other close friends i have around me. I urge you all to think about your friends, and next time your having some 'huge argument' stop and think, why weaken or lose a friendship. No one can have too many friends, Just a thought. Talk to you all soon, hopefuly i will be able to come to the cinema on Wednesday. See you all soon, Dave

       I was going to go down the park, but I have decided against it, as it looks like its gonna chuck down with rain. Secondly I have a cold. Thirdly I would have to walk down by myself carrying a big teddybear. Fourthly the park gets boring after a few hours anyway.

       Max, could you not say 'Jesus Christ' in the sense that you do? You use it like as an insult and I think that is really disrespectful. Fine if you don't believe in it all but its being disrespectful to others.  If your going to the park don't forget to come into Woolies on your way down (if your walking) and come and buy your sweets and stuff. Yay!

       About the date: This is the one it is set on. The only others are in just number fomr or May 2004 etc.. There are no other day and month ones so its just this. I really don't think it makes that much of a difference.  I am: Lirit Choiseul, Nemesis of The Lost - A lonely one who guides the lost - but not to safety, to their doom.

       Well we can't go back to the old layout and I think this one works well. Yea the advertis annoying but it doesn't exactly spoil the whole site and I am happy with it.   General Studies was allright, I managed to anwser every question. Got 3 hours of geology today, not happy about that at all. I have been revising shockingly but none of it is sinking in so I most likely will fail this exam.  Great.  Good luck with CT everyone, good luck with any other exam you have this week.

       HI, I am not sure if i prefer the new or old layout, I had a good day off today, when of course i should have had a good day doing critical thinking revision. It looks like i will be made to re-take that next year, (whats the chances of me getting A-C)  Anyway, whish you all luck with all your exams, anyone like me needs all the luck they can get their hands on. Talking of what you can get your hands on, anyone see the  10:30 ITV news    Croydon high school , which is litrally a stone throw away from my house was on there, as well as  john ruskin college  and  other selsdon schools , because a load of kids in this area have stolen exam papers before the exams, piles of papers have been found on the streets of selsdon, and where was i during all this sudden media attention in the selsdon area, IN KENLEY !!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Oh well one day i will be on TV, one day i will be a star! Talk to you all soon, Dave

       Well that sucked today. It wasnt too bad, but very boring. C grade?  Went round Dave's last night to sort some of his stuff out and help him with his next door neighbours computer. In the end we both earnt ourselves a score each!  The new Apple Mac rocks. I'm suprised you haven't got one Tom...  My feet are freezing. Ah! I'm getting double glazing in a few weeks! Yay!

       Morning everyone, Lots of changes to alert you to. First of all we have a new layout of: Tic Tac Blue as requested. Enjoy guys. Please keep your profiles updated. I can't figure out how to delete archives because I thought it'd be good to almost start again, ie: with the new template start new archives. However can't find this option so gonna have to have all the old posts as well which isn't too bad but remember (this goes to everyone) they are old posts from the past when things were different and before we grew up over the summer. Some people may get that more than others.  Um. Ok so that is the main change. LOL.  Sorry I couldn't make it to bowling, had to work all day and then do revison (forced to by parents, gah). I hope you had a good time.  General Studies today, should be a giggle NOT. 2 and half hours. Yipee. 3 hours geology tomorrow. Pants.  Hope you all have good day!

       Hiya Had a bad couple of days (reason i havent blogged), I am fine again now. Went dog racing last night, i won some and lost some, but end of the night, i came home with 12 less than i went with! It was a bit of a laugh. I really hope loads of people turn up on sunday, will be more exciting/challenging. But i am not a competitive person (lol hehe lol)  Glad to hear that everyone is revising as hard as i am, look foward to seeing as many of you as possible tommrow. Any problems or questions about tommrow, call/text me. Dave

       Work this weekend. Gah. Nice weather though. Yay! Dave I shall see what I can do but I doubt I'll be able to make seeing as I have no idea where it is. I'll talk to Lora, see how she is getting there. If I do come obviously I'll be late.  Have a nice weekend dudes, when on study leave those of us who usually go down park - maybe we should do that again? Sit under the tree, do sod all all day, be childish on slide. Lol. And whoever else wants to come should come!

       Yeah, everyone seems to be borrowing pirate equipment off of moi :b According to a few people, I look alright in a bandana, if I have it underneath my hair? I dunno, maybe I'll try it out a bit.  I'm listening to Run by Snow Patrol. Marvellous. I'm also very wet, cos I've just got back from doing my paper round, where the heavens decided to open. Am also a tad stressed about impending exams and whatnot, but should be OK... first one is Critical Thinking on Tuesday.  Gah, I'm gonna be at school virtually all half time rehearsing for the school play. Bah.

       I'll see what I can do Dave but I doubt I'll be able to get there before 3!! Still have to go home, get changed, eat and get there. I will probably get out of work late, usually do.  I'm on my second day of the art exam and its going horribly wrong. Explain more another time. Paul came over yesterday after school which was nice to see him :) He loverly. The quiz was amusing, we came second to last. Woo!! Some of the costumes were pretty cool. Adam Ant. What a giggle. And then all the nurses. Lol.   I am listening to the Bohemian Rhapsody. Love it. *big grin*.  I shall change the layout at the weekend most likely. Should be good.

       Hello Everyone, Nicki - If you finish at 2, you can still come a bit late if you want, loads of people are gonna be a bit late anyway. Max - Glad to hear you can come, i am trying to get Lora to come, but she has the same problems as Nicki Tom - If you can please let me know if you can come, cheers  Ok, Yesterday i went out for this meal, started with the theory that i had a physics exam in the morning (eg. this morning) so i wouldnt drink anything alcholic. It didnt last long,First of all i was joking around with the waitress and she guessed that i was 18/19 so i said yea i am, she then insisted on buying me a drink, and once you start you cant stop. I drunk far too much, i remember getting into the car with a beer and telling my dad that i hadnt been drinking at all. I wasnt the most drunk out of us 4 though so it could have been worse. I came in for the exam this morning, on time, but with sun glasses and a sore head!!! Still the exam went better than i expected, so that is good. I will not be in school tommrow. But i wilil be on friday. Please encourage others to come on sunday. I dont really care who comes, (you all know who i like and who i dont!) Look foward to seeing you all soon, Text me if you wanna know anything, Dave

       Happy Birthday Dave, I hope you have a great day!  Last night Paul and I went to see 'The Passion Of The Christ'. Very  very  powerful and moving film. I won't go on because I am sure you guys do not want to hear about my religious babble. Thank you for the invite Dave but on Sundays if I am not working all day I finish at 2. So can't come. Sorry.   General Studies exam: was ok. Missed a few of the sciency / mathy questions out but I anwsered the 40 mark one with tons of waffle. That usually works for me.  Template: I'll wait for votes from Max, Paul and Jackie before I decide weather we change or not. I think we may as we have had this layout since the blog begun.

       Pretty much every other single school in the country has sent their lower sixth off on study leave, apart from ours. Eliot's solution* to this is not to turn up to school unless he feels like. Quite right too.  Happy birthday David, it is officaly the 18th of May, so you are now 17. Hurah.  General studies exam? Well, err, I haven't a clue, I just wrote lots of crap.   * Max: You're probably looking at this and thinking that I've got an aprostophe there where I shouldn't have. Well I should, because the solution 'belongs to' Eliot, you use an apostrophe to indicate this.

       Dave, thanks for the invite. I think I can come sunday! :D  I was sick yesterday 5 times. Lovely. Was going to take the day off school BUT NO, I couldnt risk failing business studies and general studies for the sake of one day's work. Anyway I felt fine.  General studies exam was okay, I reckon a C/maybe low B. How did you guys/girls do?  Night.

       Hi, It seems like i am talking only to myself but i need to talk, i am in that kinda mood. I had my first driving lesson today, !!! YAY !!! I have the same driving instructur as Tom and Paul, the lovly Alison. I had 2 hrs or 2X 50 mins, i did loads, i can already do gears 1, 2 and 3, all the stearing business, i drove round cones, i stopped, did skid control, (as part of the stopping procedure) Also something exciting happened!!! the hook from a glider came falling to the ground towards our car! On Alisons say so, we quickly moved away from the landing site!!!! could have been a problem. anyway, it was great and i am happy, on monday we go drive in sandersted!!! at 11, so i advise you tell your parents to keep off the road between 11 and 12 on monday.  Apart from driving it is my birthday, or will be in 2 hrs and 20 mins, i got my pressies this evening, some cloths and driving stuff, main present being the driving lessons. I also got some money from distant relatives etc etc etc. Urm, tommrow i am going out for a meal with wayne, and both our girlfriends, so that will be nice.    SUNDAY BOWLING AMF 2 O'CLOCK  All of you lot are invited, and all your partners, (or potential partners, or whoever!) its kinda for my birthday but i am leaving it fairly open and everyone pays for themselves. Tell other people and stuff. Right i think i better go do some work and stuff. See you all soon, Hope you all well, Good luck with all the exams and stuff, Dave

       Tom and Dave, no need for jibes on here ok. I am sure you are both working hard weather you have an extension or not.  I worked a full day at woolies today. It was, in the words of Paul, 'filthily' hot in the store. I brought some chocolate after we shut and it was soft! I know last summer it was hot enough for the chocolate to have melted. It all had to be sent back because apparently you could hold up a bad of chocolate and see it in almost liquid form. Yucky. Oh yes I am looking forward to working over summer.  I managed to slice my hand 3 times with scissors today while ripping up boxes. Owee. They sting a lot.   Other news in my world; I have convinced mother to allow me to dye my hair, but only when I am 18 which is good. Better than the normal NO I get. LOL.   Those who don't run their own blog the urls for the templates are as follows, please tell me which you prefer if you have a preferance:  urlLink No.897   urlLink Snpashot Tequila   urlLink Tic Tac Blue

       Hi, I am having great fun, on my 'MEDIA WEEKEND' and just to annoy tom, i have now completed all of my research stage for video and radio! and by the end of the day i will have done a significant chunk of the pre-production stage too!!! So in a way i am happy, but its alot of work. Anyway, i got up really later yesterday and did media, then Becky (the gf) took me out for a candlelit meal for my birthday, she brought me Hugo Boss aftershave (the new and improved david now more irrasistable than ever before) so that is nice. and she brought me a big glittery card, also her parents brought me a card (From them) (is that strange???) so i got home at 00:30 this morning and slept for a while, up nice and early to do this media, am now having a short break, and a BBQ in a bit. Then back to work. I hope your all well, and we will do something soon, i am thinking i wanna take people bowling next weekend, maybe sunday. what do we think? good idea? Anyway work to be done, speak to you all soon, Good luck tom, Dave

       Awww. Well I am at work all day today. Woo. Um, still got 1 essay to write plus a evaluation for textiles and my art prep to do as well as get ready for gen stu exam tomorrow. Anyone know details for it? When? Where? I missed my last lesson due to textiles exam so meh.  Um, I'm all injured. My neck is killing me when I look down so being on the till today won't help at all. Its partly the way I sleep, I sleep in a funny position and also partly due to stress. I have noticed how when I am very very stressed some limb or something hurts. The other week I couldn't breath properly because my ribs were hurting. Now its my neck. Ack.  Tom blog bitte. :)

       Well not much to write about other than the fact I have now finished all my courseowrk so far. Unless I get set anymore. Friday was a good day for me as I only had one proper lesson, My revision is not going well as I find it physically impossible to revise but meh...  General studies should be fun... Scientific domain... Argh, its gonna suck so badly, we have been doing practice papers and they are impossible! Because its the scientific domain I get to miss the next general studies lesson we have cause I'm doing scientific domain at the moment...  Yes, I have no work to day, good job too because shortly I will be venturing outside to top up my tan... If the sun is still out that is!  I will be tidying my room today as it looks like a mass of papers and clothes... Shouldn't take me that long. I'm also going to the library.  Thats about it from me. I might update a bit later if someone else blogs.

I know I am doing Science paper.Er...Monday evening I'm going to see The Passion Of The Christ as hinted at by Starky as I am doing that in Art. I think Paul is coming but he is still deciding. Um.

       Today I proved to Beckett that his car has fluffy steering.  Proper steering is what they have in real cars like Jaguars and Aston Martins. Beckett seems convinced that fluffy steering was part of a man's car, and all these nice cars have rubbish steering. (Before any of you have a go at me, I am aware that Beckett can't get a Jaguar, the point I'm making is that he thinks his steering is the best and that proper steering is boring.)  Proper steering is the one where you can feel the road as you go round tight corners. Fluffly steering is when you require very little effort to turn the wheel; fluffly steering is also when you can turn the wheel from full left-lock to full right-lock without moving the car.  I successfully proved him wrong by driving around the car park using my pinky finger only on the steering wheel, then turn the wheel right round without moving the car (doesn't did the tires any good, but I was proving a point dammnit!).  He later proved himself wrong by driving around that tight corner on the Caterham by-pass, only with his pinky finger on the steering wheel.  Thomas 1, Beckett 0.

I'm just sitting at school listening to The Rasmus, I've taken James iPod again.. He has the album on there, so hehe.  I'm bored, everyone else has gnoe down the shops but I couldn't be bothered to go dwon there...  I have another 2 hours before my next lesson.

       Slightly confused at first but I am liking it now. I was just looking at the templates, does anyone what the layout changed? Or are you all happy with how it is now?  I have my textiles exam in two days. Ahhhh.  I have to go and find Mr Hogg today and have a stern word with him. Which will probably end up in him having a stern word with my form tutor but I am very upset about what he said to me yesterday so grrr.

I really enjoyed myself, another fab party from Andy - nice one! Found it hard to pull myself out of bed. No hangover for me, I didn't drink that much. Can't help but laugh at Matt W, I bet when he got up today he felt awful. Tsk tsk. Well I enjoyed myself and can't wait to party with Paul and Neil etc... again.

       HI, Welcome to Saturday. Just got home from Andys. It was great fun, had a really good time, and have some good photos. Ever the rain couldn't spoil the mood and atmosphere, well done to Andy for yet another, highly successful and well organized party. Although there is already things about the party I am regretting, doing/saying. Generally it was brilliant and nice to let my hair down 'as they say'. One word if anyone don't know what to talk about LEE. You could write a book on every day of his weird and mucked up life. It scares me. Talk to you all soon, Have a great weekend. Dave

       Hmmm  Well I'm gonna be boring and wear my trackie bottoms tmor cause my jeans are annoying and will fall down. I will be wearing a top that say  "Get you kits of boys" Come on England!  As long as it is dry of course...  Argh, I have actually begun some revision. And it sucks. I have so much work on at the moment.

       Errrr probably jeans and tshirt and light jacket. Everyone always gets really hot when on the castle and stuff.   So I only just got in from school. Spent past 2 hours drawing a man, naked. He was naked not me. It was quite good, he was talking to us before and he did the poses we needed. He did the pose of the crucifiction of Christ. It was really good. I did some good pictures. Nakedness. Gah. Unless its Paul :p  Err what else. Oh yea I can't breath properly, My whole rib cage hurts, mainly on the left side. I'm kind of worried. It REALLY hurts to breath. And no one else is in so I can't ask mother what to do. Gah. Maybe I'll just die. Or not. Rather not.

       Lol Jackie, so 100% of your grass is going to be taken up by a trampoline? :P  I am wearing Jeans and a blue/dark shirt (NO, not the hawiaan one).  Ohhh yeah, ordered my eMac today. Should arrive before the 14th.

       Well... Not much to blog about, hense why I haven't blogged.  If I have not already said, I might be getting a trampoline, I just have to convince my dad it's a good idea and that it won't ruin his grass... I measured the garden and it is just big enough for a 12ft trampoline. So that's the one I will be getting if I can convince my dad.  I am looking forward to Andy's party, it should be fun. I have a question though:   What is everyone wearing?   I stayed after school today and did some work, I also played a game of pool with Laura. We started playing thinking there was no white ball so we were using the black ball, only for an upper 6th person to say, why arn't you using the white ball? We were like Dohhhh  Umm, yea thats about it.

       OK so I was only in school for first 2 lessons today then I went to London with Scott and James (Maragone) to do arty stuff like visit the Tate and St Pauls. Well well well. 1) James decided to cross the road at a non crossing point and we were nearly run down by a motorcyslist 2) while walking over the milliemememen bridge there was this HUGE fork of lightening the next bridge over so we stood to watch then realised we were on a metal bridge so promtly left 3) standing outside St Pauls and it starts to hail reeeeeeeeeeally heavily so all 3 of us squished into a phone box and then there was this huge FLASH and lightening struck St Pauls right next to us 4) on way through croydon James decided to run across the tram track and nearly got us run over  Thats 4 times I nearly died today. *cries*

       Good morning ya'll. Hope your plans for the day are full of sleep and rest or in Pauls case working but getting lots of dosh!!!! :p I am offt o bluewater today, kinda annoyed I had to get up early. Ate out last night and will be eating out today so I'm gonna be fat on Monday. I am pondering buying some kind of excerise thingy. I like rowing machines but too expensive for me. Um what else. Oh yea blue fans are really bitchy. I made a post on the official blue forum to say I was selling some blue singles etc.. an dthey are all replying going 'omg how can you sell them i'd treasure them forever'. I'm like helloooooooooooo I am trying to help some of you out here! Idiots.    If you could spend a month doing whatever you want, going whereever you want where would you go and why and what would you do?

       Sorry to hear you not so happy Dave :( oh :(  how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most?  because you put all your faith and trust in that one person so if they do something weather its intentional or not it will hurt ten times more than from any otyher. It's life, it sucks but it happens. You just got to be careful about who your closer friends are.  and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers?  no idea!  and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live? You don't say anything. Sometimes they live a lot longer than that one month. You spend teh next month giving them good memories, taking them places or just being all that you can be for them. You just gotta try and make them happy so they don't regret their last month or so. Hope its all ok :) Btw Dave when is your bday?  Sorry this is short would write more about my amazing day at Woolies but must dash off to Gatwick. See you all soon!

       Hello everyone, my long weekend isnt quite going to plan and isnt anywhere near as enjoyable as i had hoped it would be. Just one question for you all today, how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most? and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers? and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live?  They are three questions i asked myself yesterday, hope your all having fun, see you soon. Dave

        W00T!  I finally have all my money for the eMac. Will cash the last of it in Tuesday, and wait til the 12th/13th May for it to be delivered.  Had my group interview at Waitrose today, went quite well........Matt.B is lucky - they get like 10% of their wages every year bonus - as well as 50% off ANY external class you take - for example, if I was to take guitar lessons, Waitrose will pay 50% of it! W00T!  Byebye.

       HIYA, I like your description paul, most informative, and imaginative. I have been at school this evening doing stuff for stagecoach, i dont mind too much becuase i get paid for all that. Anyway i am suffering from sleep deprevation, actually it feels like in the night when my body is trying to go to sleep, a team/army of small ompa-lompa type beings is creeping into my room, picking me up and taking me to several amusment establishments, where i am forced onto a vast amount of high intensity rides, after which i do one lap of the world (running) after which i am thrown out of an airoplane traveling at extream veloicity (without a parachiot) i would then land in the sea and have to swim the length of the atlantic, followed by many a hungry shark back to my bedroom, where the seemingly nice small people would tuck me in and leave me there to awake in the morning feeling like the night never happened. So thats that out the way. See you all soon, Dave

       I shall tell you all what my throat feels like. It feels like someone has ripped it out, and thrown it into the woods, whereupon a tiger has found it. It has taken it home, and fed it to it's 3 little tiger cubs, who have mauled it for a period of 18 days. Then, a hunter comes and shoots the tigers, and manages to accidentally shoot my throat four times in the process, picked it up, ran it through the blender 7 times, dipped it in acid, rubbed it down with sandpaper, and then returned it to me. Gah.

       The Tempest is over now which is quite sad. I kinda wish it was still going on, although it is nice to have my life back a bit. Well done again to everyone :)  What is everyone doing for work shadowing / experience? I'm not doing it. I am using my costumey stuff from the shcool play and shall go into school on Thursday to do textiles all day as I have alot to catch up on. Eek.   I'm stupidly tired.

       I also was extreamly pleased with how last nights show went, and all potential 'situations' were defused so thats all good. Looking foward to doing it all again tonight, however it always gets a bit sad knowing that months of work and time and effort has gone into this show and now its finishing. Oh well, i am still happy, see you all soon.  Dave

I am so proud of everyone involved including the techies and very proud of Paul.  Well done to everyone and I look forward to being back tonight. I am sure tonight will be just as good if not better.  For now I must go off to work, wopee.

       First show was indeed good, hoping the next two will be even better though  Was a tad disappointed by the football result, but ah well, we'll get another chance in two years, so never mind, eh?  I'm not entirely sure how friendly the atmosphere will be backstage tonight. Certain members of the tech crew, and a certain actress may very well be a bit difficult to work with. Ah well, here's hoping it goes OK *fingers crossed*

       HIYA First show tonight and it went really really well, couldnt have been better. So it is not in my mind surprising that the evening ended with a punch up. Nothing is ever 100% perfect.

No idea why Tom hasn't blogged so could you blog please Tom? Thanks :)  I've been helping out with the production for the Tempest, I've been doing costumes and set and stuff so wheeeeeeeeeeeee! Yay :) The show is looking great, really good acting with some great sounds and lighting in it so come and see! tickets on sale from the box office at break times. Students are 4.00. It rocks.

       Thought I'd pop in and say Hi.  Haven't really been up to much lately although I had a successful shopping trip yesterday. I counted up my DVD's and I have 29... All brought from WHSmith and since November! I shall be buying the Scary movie box set when I get payed as I can't afford it until then. I'm working tonight and so am bunking off last lesson, I'm then working all day saturday...  Means lots of money when I get paid! Yay!  Nicki about the cinema, when do you want to go? Just chat to me on msn or something...  I won't be on the internet much tonight as I'm working till about 8, won't get home until at least 9pm... Then I have a exam tomorrow, so will have to revise. Of course I probably won't revise...  Parents have got tickets to Wimbledon, so they have gone off there today. But I think it will rain so they probably won't see much play, which is a shame really as the ticket are quiet expensive. I heard they are seeing Venus Willaims and some other well known dude. I just can't think of the name right now. there is also some other random person that knocked Hennman out of the French open so they are seeing some good amtches considering its the opening day. they are on number one court I belive so that's also good!  Well. that's my blog for a while. Blog agin in a few days/ weeks!

CounterStrike at night, obviously.  Next week will be interesting. Parents are away from tuesday til Friday night! W00T! Having the whole house to myself.  Pah, I have to go in on inset day to do an exam. Sucky.

Past 2 days I have been mostly in textiles room helping to do the tye dying for the school play next week. Its pretty tiring but they need it done. next Wednesday I am doing the textiles stall for the induction days along with Megan and someone else, maybe Helen? Should be interesting and hey we get to dress up smartly!  Work today until 1.30 then going up to school to get T-shirts to bring home and finish off. Going to see Charlenes play tonight with Paul :). Working all day tomorrow.   What is everyone upto this weekend?

       Pah, the BB row was just like the usual Saturday here when my Dad comes home from work. Nothing TOO special, except the table going over and the tin foil tray.  Anyhow, 2 x 1.58 has been charged to my bank account without me saying so......contacting the bank on Tuesday to sort it out.  As for A-Levels, I am sticking to what I did last year. I will probably take General Studies A2. Might as well, 3 lessons a fortnight and a whole A2 for it. General Studies does suck though...but I think I can tolerate it for another year.  Fathers Day Sunday.........what have we all got em'? I haven't purchased anything yet, but i'll give him a massive bar of Cadburys choc and a new shirt (as his old one is all worn round the collar).

       I don't tend to watch BB that much, just on a random basis. I watched it last night and thought what a bunch of losers. All the fighting and stuff its just like oi, you fools, grow up. Although I supose makes it interesting to watch although I kinda got bored of it after a while. But yea. No riots in Croydon last night, good. Just lots of people. So its good when England win because the hoodlums stay away. Woo!  First day back at school everyone? How'd it go?  I thought it was ok. I was very very tired though. What is everyone doing for September, dropping any subjects or taking up any?

Still, will be cool to get on with some ICT A level style, ahem! yeah right, bunking time i think...  Still, very tired now, so earlyish night, its already gone 11 so night night all, and see you tomorrow, though by the time you've read it I will have seen u already! CRAZIE! Andy

       Hiya everyone, On the footbal front its really not my thing. People shouldnt riot, but those who do know what they are getting themselves into, i think they should all be locked up. Maybe we need to build a prision in Croydon, maybe in the new Central centre. Drama exam was ok, had to stay at school keep an eye on the lights, got home about nine, some of the art was to a really good standard this year, well done everyone, however i must now urge all art and textiles students to remove their work, as soon as possible, or it will be removed for them, we have a show to do!!!  Talk to you all soon, see most of you tommrow, Dave

       I don't see how they can be good at what they do. Its just kicking a ball round and keeping fit. Doesn't really require much skill. I admit if you put me there I'd suck but then again I suppose if you practise to the extent and all that they do then yea you would be better than others but I really cannot see the skill or talent involved. I know its a part of the police's job to deal with rioting but I don't see why people need to turn around and have a go at the police when all they are doing is trying to stop the rioters damaging too much property and from injuring other people.  I tend to get really pissed off when people slag off the police which if what hooligans and such do because they are doing their job. Its not like they go out of their way to spoil their fun or whatever, its their job as you say and I wish that people would think twice before doing something which can injure or kill a police officier, what about their families and such? Shame people don't think much these days.

       It's fair enough to have an opinion but a few of the things u mentioned I disagree with. It doesnt suck, it is a bunch of overpayed kids i agree, but they are bloody good at what they do.  The riots and alcohol stuff is a bit o.t.t because those thugs will get pissed and fight about anything, when theres no world cup, they'll fight over a bloody ham sandwich!  The policemen bit.  Its their job, though it sounds harsh, but it is their job.  My mum and dad enjoyed their time in the police but it wasnt the easiest job they ever had.  My dad was quite often wrestling 7 foot south african burgalars, and he didnt always come out on top!  BTW, Im not having a go... :)  Its nice every two years to have a tournament of the countries favourite game.  Apart from that, Im working loads stil, not enjoying all of it, but hey, its money. Will see you all tomorrow :)  Still, best of luck to England, and speak soon to y'all

       Well football in my opnion sucks. I really don't like the game itself and I have made the effort and watched a match before but I find it incredibly pointless because in my opinion its some guys kicking a ball into a net which doesn't actually require that much talent. I like footie when your playing it with your mates and its just a laugh but anything bigger, no thanks. Give me a good ol game of rugby, a bunch of lads with a ball. Simelar to footie in that aspect but there are many more ways of scoring etc... And that really is talent, just look at Johnny Johnny Johnny Wilkinsons lastkick. Yuss! Although lately I have become a bit partial to cricket. I love it. Woo! The barmy army, love em!! So back to why I hate football. I hate the world cups and stuff because you get all the football hooligans which I know isn't everyone but it seems to be most people and then they have to go off and get pissed and get into fights (something riugby goers do not do, a game I went to the fans simply shook hands said good game then wandered off happy as bees) just take Croydon as an example. 400 fans in Croydon, riot. Smash windows etc..., surrounded a tram. 15 or so policeman were injured. Thanks a lot, what if that had been my dad working that night? Luckily he wasn't but he could be next time. I see why people drink alcohol at games but there is no need to drink that amount that causes rioting. I mean, what exactly were they rioting about?? The fact we lost? well we still have 2 games left and even if we lose oh well, theres always next time.

       The football was quite disappointing, although I was so knackered that day I spent most of it asleep. I like football when it's the World Cup and stuff, cos of the massive levels of patriotism, which is cool.... I've been trying to work out what it is about football that makes it our country's most popular sports..... anyone help me on that one?  Anyway, on a more academic note, last exam today, Drama, then a rehearsal for the Tempest, and then FREEDOM!!! .... until tomorrow that is

       35 hours of over time so far in One Week!! How are we all?  Sorry Ive not been around to chat much, been living at sainsbury's!  Im gonna get a hoomungus pay check! Can't wait!  I wasn't happy about Englands football game.  I know no one is a big footie fan, but if you saw the game you will understand!  We were beating France, the competition favourites, and they scored two goals in less than a minute to win it!  bastards :(  Still, Im thinking of organising a get together somewhere, somehow.  So after nine gruelling hours of sainbury's, 3 on trolleys in this blooming heat I'm rather sweaty so I am now off to take a bath!!! see you all soon :)  Andy

       Max, Tom and Paul -- if you have a spare moment could ya do a quick blog please? Thanks.  Aww poor Andy. What I would give for spending all that time collecting trollys rather than having abuse shouted at me via the idiotic hoodlums that hang around outside Woolies. Gah. Anyways, Nicki Johnson (Jen's sis) sent me a pic from her leavers ball trhough. Awww, I wish i could do our leavers ball all over again. Lol. It was so much fun. I love limos. When I'm older I shall buy one. And a driver to drive me around all day. Woo! Limo are cool. It was really good that night. I'm sure our sixth form one will be good as well, if not better? But then again, in year 11 you have your friends around you who you have known for years whereas now people like Angela etc.. have gone off somewhere else. Oh :(

       Hey all, sainsbury's sucks!  why can't they get trolleys that put themselves away when the customer finishes with it, rather than have some poor sod like me take 5 full hours to put them all away, finishing at half bloody ten!!  Still, I took a half hour brake so ner ner nikiniki ner ner sainsbury's!!  I did 6 and a half hours tills yesterday, well 3, i spent the rest of the time putting things on the shelves that the customers decided they didnt want when they got to the checkout!  I also had to buddy someone, means I'm good at my job!!!  They wanted me to watch over someone who was new and hepl them out if they got stuck, coolio or what!  Doing gardening today, sorting out Annie's Kennel.  She's gonna have a big bush going around it, talking of big bushes, has anyone seen The Mighty Boosh on BBC 3?  its VERY funny, and I recommend it,  its on most nights at 8 or half past.  Other than that all is well, looking forward to having a big reunion on thursday!  I wonder what the dress code will be this time!  beach wear, ski wear, posh, we'll see.  I know theres not many exams left but for those who do have some, again I wish you all the best of luck, and for those of you get back from the physics exam this eveing, I hope it went well!!  Brazil Night is a bit of a cock up, theres loadsa of jobs that need doing and I'm not sure we have enough people coming.  Hopefully it'll work out when the meetings start up again. If anyone has anything which could be given as a raffle prize that they don't want, or that can be brought for a small price, let me or Tom know!  Chow for Now, love and all the rest of it...

       Jackie is taking a break I spoke to her on msn about it. David there isn't a general feeling for you to leave. Lets now just forget about that and move on ok?  So today working 10 til 4.30. The word gah springs to mind but as it is such a nice day hopefully most folk will be at home sun bathing or something and won't have the energy to enter a store like ours which has no air conditioning so we all boil every day. Last summer it was so hot the chocolate melted. As in you could pick up a packet and it would literally be liquid form. I brought Rolocoaster Tycoon 2 yesterday. If anyone has it do you know how to delete a scenario you create? Lol. Any other news for you all? Um. Not at the moment. Oh yea schol play is in a couple weeks so come see! I am going on the Thursday with Matt W so if any of you wanna come please do. (Paul, Charlene, Becky, Helen, Pennie etc.. are in it)  Other than that have a nice day.

Everyone else, calm down, if it is the general feeling that you all WANT me to leave, i will, just let me know. Hope you are all well, (i suppose i should have just lied, and said that everything was fine, but i dont like lieing) Dave

       Okay........just read the last 10 blogs or so.......right.  Anyhow - Andy - V.Cool news! Where are you practising your drumming? Gonna get a drum kit soon? I think I will get my guitar in a few weeks.....yeah!  The rest of my holid......sorry, "study leave" will be spent playing CounterStrike, as I have nothing to do. My final exam is Thursday in about 10 days time. Business finance - whoop-de-doo.  ICT was okay - Paper 1 being easier than Paper 2. Some questions were a bitch. Combined with the coursework, I reckon I got a C, maybe a B. Just have to wait til August!  Ciao.

       From readin this blog I have come to the conclusion that I do not wish to be part of it anymore. David. You are the most annoying person to blog on here I have ever met. You made an arguement out of nothing. Nicki, I stand by you as all you were trying to do was sort things out. DAvid. Lay of the sarcasm and stop being a fucking arsehole basically.  Hey and goodbye Andy :)  Oh and this isn't the only reason I'm leaving. I never have anything to post about and generally I forget I'm even part of this blog. You can leave me on if you wish and I will poist once in a blue moon. But for the time being I don't want to be part of it.

       hey davie.  Thank you for the kind words :) Had a hair cut, as i said earlier. SHORT! No windsurfing though, the wind would have been good! I did however buy Joss Stone's new album.  very cool.  I got The New Breed as well, proper bo. Searching for drumming lessons, found one in warlingham and one in croydon, prices are VERY high, so I'm basically being as tight as a fat mans pocket and going for the cheapest one! I stink so im gonna go shower! chat soon ya?

       Wel Dave heres why I say that. I started up this blog and I invited people to join and blog with me which they all have. Good. Now, this means that as I run it (not that there is alot to do) I just try and keep people blogging. Thats basically all I do. I could've quite easily deleted yours and Toms posts and left it blank or I could've edited them but I didn't. Instead I left you both a message trying to stop an argument escalating which is what it seemed like and instead you turn around and start yelling at me. I do not appreciate that especially after I invited you back a second time to rejoin El Bloggo. Now if you want to discuss this any further email, msn or phone me. I am sure no one else wants to read which is most likely plastered as a petty argument. Enough.  Hi Andy, glad you could join. If anyone wants to Andy Mr Woodcock here was the cause of a HUGE queue in Woolies today. He didn't have enough money so ran out to get some (this is the second time this has happened) and caused a great big queue. Tutt tutt. Lol. Silly boy. But you do keep us amused. Yea work wasn't that great as I wasn't in the best of moods. I ended up realphabetising the drawers as some people can't spell properly and keep putting the cd's in the wrong places. Gah. No big dramas. All day tomorrow. Off to Croydon now to buy a PC game and to say hi to Paul. Have a nice day ya'll.

       Hiya, Nicki - I am sorry for being responsable for your happy mood going drastically downhill. That was not what i had aimed to do, but one thing, stop being so padantic and masterful over 'YOUR BLOG' WHICH YOU OWN PERSONALLY. No one likes that. Just calml down a bit and everything will be ok. Its nice to hear from you Andy, and nice to see you chose to blog, and didnt get a detention or solatry confinment from the 'master of the blog' the 'supreme leader of us all'. I hope everyone who went had a good time at 'Harry Potter' and i once again apolagise for not being able to make it. I hope you are all well and enjoying the rather 'heated' discussions, of late.  Talk to you all soon, Dave

       Hey all, it is I, Andyrew. How are you all?  Long time no see for a lot of you! Tom, Max, how was the ICT exam? How is everyone else doing with exams?  I'm done with them now, woohoo! I'm thinking of having my head attacked by a lawnmower, when you next see me it'll be short!  lovely.  Hopefully windsurfing today, should be fun.  I had no work last night!  apparently i booked holiday, cooool. Anywho, catch you all soon, and have fun blogging back! Love and stuff like that Andy

       Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry sorry David you thought that was me attacking you? If you must know I was not. That was actually me pointing out that you don't need to remind people to blog, thats what I do. Yes people have exams but I'm still trying to get people to blog at least once a week so really Dave, there is no need for you too. And I am deeply deeply troubled and sorry that I asked to chill out I mean how could I possibly have taken those posts the wrong way? I mean the fact that what you both wrote seemed to me, a innocent bystander, very sarcastic and a bit bitchy was completely my fault and I shall never never do it again. Oh dear, the consequences of my words of trying to calm you down when you did seem rather annoyed. Bad Nicki for trying to sort out nedativeness on the blog. Bad Nicki. How dare you! If you like I can demonstrate me attacking you, here we go:   First of all , you can not attack  me  for asking people to calm down when there is clearlya small upset weather or not you were joking. How the fuck am I supoosed to know that? I quote: It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said. -  6/10/2004 10:51:28 PM. That sounds like you are being bitchy and I care what the fuck you think about that because everyone is bitchy sometimes yes like me being bitchy and fucking pissed off right now. Ooo great start to the day huh? Thanks.   Secondly , I was only telling you to fucking relax because you got all annoyed and at this time most people need to relax anyway but bad Nicki for trying to her mates to calm down and feel better. I'll never do it again.   Thirdly , You and Tom don't clash? Fine. Fair enough. I'm not actually bothered but in that case if you are joking around together make it more clear or just don't jokily insult each other that way dumbass people like me won't get confused and try to help sort it out. Gosh I still can't believe, I was simply trying to help you out. Never again.   Fourthly , shut the fuck up about my spelling no one spells perfectly all the bloody time and usually if your writing things in a rush not everything is spelt right. Ooo how dare I say that, I bet your spelling is perfect allllll the time. And anyway don't start on all that jazz until you can blog perfectly, ie: using an I instead of i.   And Finally , I am bitchy and probably always will be.  Now I didn't have a problem with you and I don't want you to leave. I was simply trying to sort your little what appeared to me to be a tiff out so that it did not escalate into pages like this and getting people all wound up for nothing. For maybe next time instead of you being so public about attacking me you should talk to me.  Have a nice day.  Back to normal blogging.  I had begun my day quite happily. Felt fufiled by my breakfast and then I came on here to check email and whatnot to find I was being attacked as people like to put it and so now my happy mood has drastically gone downhill. Great. Have a nice day everyone.  And yes I know I could've simply either said sorry or just not replied at all but hey I'm childish and was under the impression that it was my blog to start off with and that you knwo kinda said I could try and stop people from arguing. Oh how disillusioned I am.

       Hiya, I read what you wrote nicki, I have a response:  First of all , you can not attack me for asking people to blog, and can not say that you think they should be concentrating on exams, because in the last few weeks you have written the following, 'Could everyone other than Jackie and Dave blog please? Thanks.' - 6/3/2004 04:17:22 PM 'Max could you blog please.' - 6/5/2004 08:16:51 PM  Secondly,  I do NOT need to relax, i am perfectly relaxed, and most of all, I dont need you telling me to relax.  Thirdly,  Me and Tom do NOT clash, we are actually good friends, and just sometimes joke around having a go at each others posts, i have spoken to him and neither of us are actually offended by anything each other say. Fourthly, if you are going to attack me so publicly, use real words 'onvious'???  And Finally , I am not bitchy, nor will i ever be.  And to think the main reason i came on here this evening was to write nice things and compliment you on your art/textiles display.   If you have any further problem with me, i will not hesitate in leaving. I am sorry it has come to this nicki, maybe next time you could speak to me or something controversial like that.     Well despite that little annoyance i am actually very happy today, have had a good day, i hope everyone else is good too. See you all soon. Dave

       I set this website up as an online diary or a blog as I use the word along with so many other people around the word who also use the word blog as an online diary. This blog is an online diary not for articles etc.. unless you feel them important enough to mention when writing about you day and things. Tom no one is attacking you, everyone is just stressed and whatnot at the moment so I think we all need to relax a bit. David you need to relax. If people need to blog I'll write they need to as I usually do. But at the moment if people don't blog its fine, exams, good reason. So calm down, just blog when you want so long as you blog regulary. And please, little bitchiness. Its onvious you two clash a bit. Just calm...

       This isn't a blog, it's a diary.  Blog is an abbreviation of weblog, which is a log of what you find interesting on the web. Typicaly, you find a website or article about an issue on the web and talk about it. A group weblog is the same, only with more people.  This isn't a blog, it's a diary; seeing as everybody seems to have a problem with me at the moment I might as well not bother with it at all.

       Hi, Mr Thomas Edwards - It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said, normally me or nicki, maybe you are scared of the others. Anyway, as far as i am aware the general idea is that you talk about what you have been up to, and what is going on in your life. So try doing that for a bit, see what happens.  As for everyone else, hi again.  Dave

       Hi everyone, Everyone seems a bit stressed, and i know full well i am no where near stressed enough, when we were revising and doing stuff for our GCSEs i managed to be stressed very well, but this time even though they are important exams, i am not stressed, or worried, and that is bad and becuase of it i will fail at least half my As level exams, and i am not happy about that. Anyway good luck, especially to paul, stay calm paul. See you all soon, i miss you all,  byebyebyebye Dave

And was worth it for the look on his face and the hugg i got. So i am happy, check my msn window for a pic of us in the limo. Eventually me and nicki will have a site back up ready and online so the whole picture sharing thing will be easy again. I hope you're all as happy as i am, or happy.

       Max could you blog please. No idea what you are going on about Tom and Dave.  I worked 9.00 til 5.30 today. Not much to do as we received the wrong delivery. Oh well. So I spent most of the day on a til of some sort and encountered some very very rude people. I got to throw 3 kids out of the store who then spent most of the morning shouting abuse at me.  I can't believe that though. I don't mind working at Woolies but we get abused by hooligans outside and then nick stuff and the other day they threw flour all over our stocking area out the back. Idiots. They are pathetic but cause so many problems for us.  Something is being done. We had petition going for cameras outside all the shops. I believe there is a meeting next week at like 8 in the morning for shop runners to talk about geting better security and stuff.  Its outrageous though it really is.

       Hi, Tom if you're gonna do something do it properly; Here's the rest, hope you are all well, i am great:  Some folks give tips at christmas  And some of them forget  So when he picks their bins up  He spills some on the step  Now one old man got nasty  And to the council wrote  Next time my old man went round there  He punched him up the throat   Oh my old man's a dustman  He wears a dustman's hat  He wears cor blimey trousers  And he lives in a council flat   I say I say Les  (Yeah)  I found a police dog in my dustbin  (How do you know it was a police dog)  He had a policeman with him   Though my old mans a dustman  He's got an 'art of gold  He got married recently  Though he's 86 years old  We said 'ere hang on dad  You're getting past your prime  He said well when you get my age  It 'elps to pass the time   Oh my old man's a dustman  He wears a dustman's hat  He wears cor blimey trousers  And he lives in a council flat   I say I say I say  My dustbin's full of lilies  (Well throw'em away then)  I can't lily's wearing 'em   Now one day whilst in a hurry  He missed a ladies bin  He hadn't gone but a few yards  When she chased after him  What game d'you think you're playing  She cried right from the 'art  You've missed me am I too late  Nah jump up on the cart   Oh my old man's a dustman  He wears a dustman's hat  He wears cor blimey trousers  And he lives in a council flat   I say I say I say  (Not you again)  My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools  (How d'you know it's full)  Cuz there's not mushroom inside   He found a tiger's head one day  Nailed to a piece of wood  The tiger looked quite miserable  But I suppose he should  Just then from out the window  A voice began to wail  He said Oy where's me tigers head  Four feet from his tail   Oh my old man's a dustman  He wears a dustman's hat  He wears cor blimey trousers  And he lives in a council flat   Next time you see a dustman  Looking all pale and sad  Don't kick him in the dustbin  It might me my old dad   THE END

       For the last three days, I've been at school rehearsing for the school play, The Tempest. I have four exams after half term, and I'm not confident on my revision for any of them. I have lines to learn for The Tempest. It's right after the exams. Right after that we have work shadowing. Bye now

       Hiya, Tom - I am neither confused or dying to know more. Something you may be interested in, i bumped into mr hogg today, he has put on order for next yr, 2 more cameras and 2 more e-macs. so thats good. I did, if you havent guessed already, pop into school today, to oversee a drama rehursal,  that was good, the tempest may actually be a good show! Other than that i have had all the social dilemas and problems you normally have in a month in one day, so thats not a good thing, and now everyone has gone to sleep before i could put things right, and i hate it when that happens. Lots of chatting to do in the morning i guess.  Hope you all well and revising hard. Dave

       So yesterday was at work from 9 until 6. Not too bad really. Found out what the great British public like to buy on a sunny bank holiday: swingball. Woo! And black bistro sets. At 29.99. Woo!  Today I wandered into Croydon and back out again having brought like nothing apart from some more hair shampoo. LOL. Great. I am such a big spender. Haha. Paul is coming over once he finishes work so that'll be cool. Other than that I haven't done very much. I should've spent today doing revsion. But did I? No. Gah.

       Fair enough Dave. Hope ya have fun in Canada! Nice place.  Hey Max I presume you've spent most of your days playing this Counterstrike game then huh? Heehee, I've spent most of my time when I haven't been out playing Rolocoaster Tycoon 2. I'm addicted :(   Coudln't sleep last night. Thought I'd get to bed earlyish but it was so hot and then once I finally got to sleep I woke up again then went back to sleep so all in all I slept about 3 hours last night before waking up at 8.15 by the sun streaming in through my white curtains. Gah. So I'm tired.

       My week has been okay I suppose. I'm meant to see Lora sometime, but I don't know when that is.   So far I have been doing nothing over the holidays since Sunday, when I came back from my Aunts. One thing to look forward to: Bad Lads Army tonight! Best thing ITV have had on all year.   On another positive note, I managed to grab a high score of 27 kills to 11 deaths on CounterStrike, coming in first place - and far ahead of the second to top who had a score of 19 kills to 15 deaths. I'm sure you are all very, very interested in that.   Now i'm off to have lunch and to chase up Apple. They need to replace my eMac monitor due to two mini electron guns going tits up.

       Well my weekend was crazy what with work work work! *cue disney song: whistle while you work, la la la la la la laaaaa* Yea anyways....lol. Had my half day of till training yesterday. Got into an argument with my manager a bit about being allowed to do refunds. I don't want to do them, he wants everyone to do them. Had a lecture on shrinkage. Great. Um yea the new tills are fun, they are touch screen and we will go live in August at some point so if you come into woolies watch out because queues may be long what with getting to know the tills an all.  After work I popped over to Jackies to give her pressie, yay! Then went to Paul's which was fun. We played Spiderman monoolopy! Yay! It was cool. :) Today may be off to Ikea to get bedroom furni.  Dave why you break up with Becky? You two seemed cool.

       Well worked this morning so didn't open my cards and one present until about 2.30pm!  Work was boring and I was really tired, possibly because I didn't get to sleep until about 2am last night as I was so bloody hot! I went to bed at about 12.30am so I was pretty pissed off.  I got a cool card from work, they give us weird cards and I was given one about marriage, it was quite funny especially some of the notes inside... I'm now getting married tomorrow to my good buddy susanna!  I got given a School of Rock DVD from my parents, along with some money for my holiday and the money its gonna cost to get a provisional liceanse. My sister got me some stuff about driving, so that was fun! Oh yea and I got given some L plates... The rest of my "presents" was in fact money and I think it added up to about 250 all together, so not bad really! Althought its already gone down cause I owed my mum 20 and my dad 10!  Cinema last night was good, meal was nice although I was kinda annoyed because there were some people there that I don't particulary like that much. Darren pissed me off because he did nothing but smoke all night. He had like 15 cigarrettes while we were out... About 7 after the film finished and before we got on the bus home. We were on the bus along with what seemed like the whole of the old year elevens, who were all drunk and probably high. They were also eating chicken and it was making me feel well hungry! When we got off the bus a few people got off after us and as we walked off home a fight broke out behind us, don't really know who was involved and didn't stick around long enough to find out. Stupid really because it probably ruined their night out!  Nicki, that's fine if you wanna come round Monday, just give me a more direct time as I have to check I'm not working! I don't think I am... But you never know!  I'm gonna shut up now.

If you are not busy on Monday perhaps I can pop over after work to give you your pressie on my way to Pauls house? Would do over weekend but working all day both days I think so no time :( But yea, have a cooooooool day!  War and Peace yesterday was cool. Brought some more camo's. Slightly sunburnt....oh man it hurts so much! When I have a shower I thought ooo the water will perhaps cool it but oh no, just stings! GAH! Ah well.  Working all day today. May try and book a weekend off somewhere just so I can relax a bit. So far all my weekends off have consisted of me taking them off for a reason so perhaps it'll be nice just to have a weekend to do sod all.  Hope your day is cool everyone!

       At the moment, I'm wearing blue shorts and my tie-dyed Tempest t-shirt. I look a state, good job I'm not going anywhere. I've had a largely unexciting two days. Most exciting thing that has happened is me going to see the new Sainsbury's, which I'm quite impressed with :D  My plans up to next Friday look a little like this:  Today: Bugger all Tomorrow: Work, take my little brother to cinema to see Around The World In 80 Days :) Sunday: Nowt again. Probably tidy up my room and make a start on my homework (shocking!) Monday: Nicki coming over :) Tuesday: Work in the evening, during the day too if they'll let me Wednesday: Off to Nottingham to visit family! Thursday: Still in Notthingham Friday: Come back from Nottingham  A question to everyone:  Which celebrity do you think you resemble the most?

       Cool Jackie. Simon wants to go down park so I said may as well leave it up to Jackie and I as we organised the majority of then last summer. It was cool :) Well my week next week as far as I know (until I go work on Sat and check hours for week) is: Monday: working 9 - 12 being kingstore trained, then Pauls in afternoon Tuesday: having hair cut (yes cut cut short short, wel, short) Wednesday: possible work Thursday: possible work Friday: possible work I can't say for sure during the week until Sat. Sounds like a good idea anyway :)  Today and tomorrow I am out at the war and peace show so should be good. It appears I have done my back in somehow. Perhaps I fell over during the night because it hurts rather alot. Gah.  Have a cool day ya'll.

       End of term guys and gals. Yay. Thank God for that. It came way too slowly. I have one lesson this morning and that is geology and that consists of watching the fifth element which at the moment I still stand by as being a bad film but then again only 1 hour into it, roughly.  I am going Croydon tonight to get Jackie a pressie :) I know you said you didn't want any by Jackie you know I am gonna get you summit.   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?&nbsp;  Family then Paul.  2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  A new life. No sorry I dunno. There isn't anything&nbsp;I desparatly want. Perhaps driving lessons then a car or something I dunno.  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?&nbsp;  Whatever Paul wants.   4. Do you give any away?  I'd give to the company or organisation that looks after the war graves. I am sure there must be a donation area somewhere and I shall donate. 5.  Do you invest any? If so, how?  Put some away in one of those accounts where if you don't touch it for like six years you get double or something silly like that. Put some away for uni and let interest gather.

What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  The fattest, fastest computer I can build, oh yes - and a PowerMac G5 worth about 8000.  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  Laptop for Lora's bday.  4. Do you give any away?  I'll give my parents some to put towards their new house.  5. Do you invest any?  Yes, buy a small house in a popular holiday tourist place and rent it out to people.

I'd gt some stocks and put some away in a high interest bank so that I get lots of extra money.

       HIYA, Paul - yesterday the driving school of kenley phoned me, to let me know that there had been some kind of 'dissagrement' and that they had decided to 'terminate her contract'  so in mordern language, that means they had an argument and sacked her.  Kenley will probally call you as well paul, they said to me that if i want they would arrange me another instructor from kenley, but they also said they dont know what she is doing now. I have talked with tom about this and he aggrees that she is either gonna start up on her own or join another company, and kenley aggree that it would be good for us to stay with her. so i will be contacting her to find out what she is doing, and hopefully will be continuing my lessons with her. Talk to you all soon, Dave

       1. Yes, but the straps broken and I haven't worn it in about a year now. It's a chunky black digital one  2. Um. When in 1997? 10/11 I guess  3. Personal happiness. There are some things money can't buy (for everything else, there's MasterCard)  4. Yeah. Not the two-fingers-in-mouth whistle though  5. Uh. It's possible I suppose. But I've never seen any paticularly good evidence, so it remains unknown

       No one has blogged this week :( Mind you I haven't either. Tom please blog? We don't argue with EVERY single thing you say. Andy blog too!  Um so this week. UCAS, what do you all think of that? I feel that Tuseday was quite a waste as there were no art students and I really need to sort out how to aply to art colleges. I am sure it was helpful for people thinking of doing law and stuff, and for those who don't know what university is like. It was allright but I felt that it didn't help me that much.  I'm still at school at the moment, doing my english lit presentation with Jenna. We're doing 'Anthem For Doomed Youth' by Sassoon and Owen. Its all very interesting and fun filled. I'm looking forward to the English Literature trip next week. I have to take LOTS of photos and do sketches as I am doing war in art and looking at the death side of things. Oh that reminds me I need to purchase some pollyfiller to use in art... Right noted. But also one of my artists I am researching has created the metal (or wood I am not sure) images that are in the Ypres memorial. All very interesting. Someone said they didn't want to go to France for two days and walk around graves, it isn't their thing. But its not walking around graves. Its walking around history. Each grave, each man who has died has a story, each man has their place in history. Even the cemeteries have their own small story to tell about why they are there. Everything there has a reason. Even the ones who have no name. Thats like a instand story of sadness because they are lost and no one knows where.   Yea so should be good. A sad trip, but still good.  If you could could everyone do a blog please? Just a quick one at least...

       Work experience was good. Surfing the internet all day. T'riffic stuff.  My throat keeps constantly getting infected - which is a nice sign of tonsilitus. Nice one.  Not really an awful lot to talk about, oh yea, seein Lora tomorrow - W00T! Now what do I get her for her bday, hmm.

       Come on guys lets blog :) Lets hear how everyones work shadowing or experience went!!  I didn't do it, instead I spent two days in school catching up on textiles work and it is looking pretty good.  I now also hate Ken Livingston. Always have really. This whole thing about 4 by 4s. There is no problem with owning one. They are lot more comfortable than some cars and yea so they are big?? So what?? They don't actually take up more space its only because they are taller. Its actually handy haveing a jeep here as there are some roads around here they actaully help getting around on. Everyone has the right to choose. Banning them are going to create so many problems. I know about the stats saying about if you get hit by a 4 by 4 you are so and so more likely to be killed because they are higher but in that case people should just be more careful. The majority of jeep owners are older people who have been driving before and so know how to handle the roads senseibly. Ugh that man annoys me so much.

       Well well I'm not topless so neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer. :p  Oh dear Lord the madness that did descend upon us at work today. We completed literally all weekend tasks on Saturday and so today could afford to do those jobs you never have time for such as: scanning off faulty goods and then: DESTROYING THEM!!! Yes. You see folks once you have scanned off a product which is faulty for whatever reason: doesn't sork, broken etc... then you must smash it up comepletely because they little pikeys can't get it out of the trash and then try and claim it for a refund. The fools. So once Lora had finished with toys and whatnot I set about on the electrial goods. Which are full of plastic, metal and other sharp objects. This left me with many a small cut on my hands, arms and face. Woo! The pain was worth the amusement of getting a mallet and smushing a kettle in one blow. Yes I really am the amazing spider-wo-man. Woooooo!  Yea so after that we spent the rest of the afternoon with everyone slagging everyone else off. In a jokey way. All rather amusing. Ritchie slagging off Lora, Lora slagging him back. Me slagging of Deano, Deano not knowing what is going on. Char helping me confuse Dean etc.. etc... madness. All of it.

       No one has joined yet, because I've only just sent the invites but its new year in roughly 4 hours I think? Next year we have GCSE's and then starting collage/6th Form. How calming. LOL. Stress stress stress! Perhaps we should all take up yoga? Or learn another language fluently so that if we fail really badly we can move to that country and be a whole new person. Wouldn't that be quite good, if when your life got so bad you could just step out of it and into a whole new one! Brilliant.  Well, people, blog!!!!

So just log in again and it's as good as new - if you have forgotton your password, just use the Remind Password feature at the bottom of the page.   urlLink A picture of a toliet  taken by my brother. Last year he went on a trip to Germany for the Christmas Markets, we have just got the photos back, and we have cellings, we have floors, we have parts of the human body (mainly feet and hands) and to top it all off we have a photo of the toilet on the coach. Amazing photography from my brother. If you want a high-resolution picture of the toliet (big enough to go on your desktop) please do contact me.  Something not quite right about that paragraph...   Anyway, no more and no less to say really - good night.

Everyone, I am adding a new nickname to my internet and text etc.. nickanmes: from now on, as wlel as Nicki, Nick, Sodapop and Emu I will be known as, NIKKO. Heehee.

       Aaaaaahhhhh, parents evening. My dad forgot most of it by the time he got home.  I ya want my opinion, the firefighters can strike for as long as they want, because the government are not going to increase their salaries by that much. Any twats that arnt careful and start fires when there are strikes can burn coz its their fault for doing it in the first place. The war I dont care about either. America are prepared to launch at minumum 400 missiles a day. Anyway, if the war starts when i'm out in America, wheyyyyy! We either: die. or stay out there until it ends :)  Toodles people, I hope you enjoyed my extremley motivational speech.

       Thats cool Tom, I think it looks good, because it creates the picture you want to see but has differnet effects and its own frame even! Wicked!  Well since I got home I have been playing about with my new 6 in 1 hair straightener. I love the curler and have been trying out leavers ball hairstyles! Yipeee. I gave up an hour ago though, kinda burnt my hand about 3 times or so.    I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.  It won't be canceled. War cannot be canceled, postproned but never canceled.

       I have (sort of) managed to scan in some photos and put them together to give you the view outside of my hotel when I went to Italy. The quaility isn't very good and the lighting conditions change in each photo, and I am missing one, and they don't line up,  urlLink but you get the idea . The mountain in the background is Mt Versovous (the one that didn't explode). The city next to it is Naples, and the town I am in is called Surento.  I think the fire fighers should wait, they will get more attenion if they wait until the stuff about Iraq has all gone, or at least got canceled.

       My parents evening. Science (Moore) was ok, we had already figured out a revision thing after school. Art, she loves me. Heehee. History was good, he said that my coursework was very good and Q2 of womens suffrage was excellent. Then I moaned at him for not putting comments on it except 'reorganise'. LOL. Um, maths, my mum likes him, lol, she thinks he is really nice. He said that all I need to do is to get 4 more questions irght in the exam and I'll get a C!!!!! Yipee! English, fine fine, briliant, marvleous, excellent. Textiles, my machine work has improved considerably, everyhing is good, my paperwork is currently at a grade B so don't be surpise dif I end up getting a A or even A* apparently. Cool. Mr G is so lazy. Throughout the whole hour and bit we were there he spoke to 2 parents. The rest of the time he was just milling about or writing something. Tutt tutt. he shouldhave found something constructive to do.  Now Tom, I agree with your last paragraph in your previous blog. Very well said. Email them, complain. I might. Actually, about the firefighters. I agree with their strikes, I don't agree with how much they are asking but striking is giving them the attention and support they need. However, I do not agree with them going on strike now when we are about to go to war with Iraq, which I reckon will happen in about 10 days time if that. (They better leave korea alone btw, just look at what happened in Vietnam!!!!) They are tying up valuable troops. Even the Gerkuas or however you spell it are helping out and they are extremly valuable! These are the guys which is their sword is drawn they must produce blood with it or kill someone before it can be put back into its sheath believe it or not. Now I will continue to support the firefighters, my Dad used to be one and we tend to go to alot of the these firefighter things, shows etc.. but I really do think they should stop all this striking until tropps are available.  Have a nice day ya'll.

       Parents Evening, I didn't go as we where tight on times to get me there, but my mother gave me all the information I need. All the normal stuff like try not to stink of fags when you walk into the class room, and show some respect for the celling, use all four legs of the chair, all the normal. My favoruite quote from the evening; "he has a wicked sense of humor", my business studies teacher. She quite liked the idea that it's cheaper to use robots because they can work in the dark. (Bit of a nerdy business joke, so don't feel gulity if you don't get it.)  I know I haven't blogged for a little while, been very busy getting my head round completcated programming problems, which still have yet to be solved. Anybody with a logical mind please enquire within.  My favourite part of music lessons has started! Sorry, did I say favourite? I meant my most hated dreaded I-really-don't-want-to-do-this part of music. Composition. Sounds easy? You just write lots of notes down, play 'em and then you're done, but there are several probelems. First of all, I can't sight read very well so when I have to play them back to myself, I can't remember what I did. Secondly, I can't read or write bass cleff, I can barely manage trebble cleff! Thirdly, I can't compose! I don't know what to do and what ever I write sounds like a monkey wrote it. This is the kind of point where I think to my self I don't want to spend 1/4th of my 6th form eduction on the flipping subject. I enjoy listening to music, and to some extent I enjoy playing it, but I hate composing and I hate learning about it. The fact the clarient wasn't around in the Baroque period isn't important information to me. I really don't need to know that serialsim sounds like me playing the piano with my arse, and I really do not need to know that a Sitar is a guitar from India without frets! I don't care! I really do not care! I don't want to know this information, please, no more! That is the end! No more ever please!   urlLink How do you mend a broken heart?   The quaility of tabloids is really getting to me - it's crap. A Solicitor jailed for life for murdering her two baby sons is freed by court of appeal, Tony Blair today pledged that after dealing with Iraq, the UN would confront North Korea about its nuclear weapons programme, and The deputy prime minister John Prescott yesterday lost patience with the striking firefighters, announcing radical new laws which would enable ministers to seize control of the industry and impose a pay and reform package. So after all this in an amazing day of news, what does The Sun have for a headline and leading story? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook - the most read "news" paper (using "news" in the broadest possible manner) in the UK and all they care about is the realtionship between two people that I really don't care about. Yes, Norman Cook has made some pretty cool music, but I really think his private and work life should be seperated and respected.  Anyway, just got to say my bit about possible war and the monkey man himself.  urlLink This sums it all up  really, nothing much else to say other than what you can see in that cartoon.

       Lol. It is 8.06, and I literally have just  finished my tea, having just got home from a   very   amusing parent's evening! Highly amusing! Basically I'm awful and am gonna fail all my GCSEs is what the teachers said, and that I'm a rebel, trboule-maker, etc etc, the usual. But other than that, a VERY amusing chat with old Mr Westlife (his bame has been changed due to the fact he has called me Josephine twice this week), and then I couldn't stop laughing when I finally sat down to talk to Mrs HIcks, a) cos I knew what my mother was gonna say, b) it was quite funny seeing my mum smiling at Mrs Hicks in her 'Yeah, I'm smiling and acting pleasant but I think you are an absolute twat' way that she does, and c) my mum had said to me before hand that I could tell all my friends that she's sorry but she tried, and she couldn;'t get her hands all the way rouind Mrs Hick's neck!!! I just could hardly control myself, and Mrs HIcks probably wondered why I couldn't stop smiling at her! Anyway, hwo did eveyerone else go? Oh, and I  have found the route of my head pains- I need to stop grinding my teeth, cos it sends pains up my jaw, adn that is where it ius coming from! SO solution found! toodles peeps.

       Headache, you had a headache! I bet mine was 100000000000000 times worse than yours! Not only have I had it for a week now but i don't have an eyeappointment for another 2 weeks. An dto top that off when I was bending ove rto pick something up off teh floor in my room I whacked my head on the side of bed (has a this wooden thing around the edge) and now have a dent in it as well as a added to headache. Hmph. But I thought it was very nice to come in, put on the internet for a quick spin on my usual message boards and blogs to find that all my cool Ryan fans are really lovely and nice and don't argue with me for the sake of it. In fact they are all relaly suportive of each other, really helpful and are happy to help each other out. Then my cousin was on msn and it was cool talking to him as he is in North Carolina. His wife, dawn, has an interview tomorrow and if she gets the job they will be moving to....ready....CHICAGO! Wahoo! They are both really lucky!!! Brilliant. have to go and visit them then. :)

       No, I will not go to tan. But that site I put up was a American one and they should have a tan anyways. No I will not be waxing, I mean like dude, the pain!!

       Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!! May I just point out though, I willl be looking after my skin but I won't be going to the full extent of having a facial (way too expensive), I won't be having a pedicure (hwo much monye is this gonna cost?!), and I won't be waxing. Guys, if you think we all complain too much about pain, I dare you to try waxing your legs, and see how much pain you get into!! Not a funny thing, waxing. Ooh, and self tan- so not a good idea if youare accident prone (comme moi!)- probably won't be doing that either, unless it washes off if it goes horribly wrong! Anyway, I cnat be bothered really, cos I'm really pale anyway, and I generally can't be assed to go to all the ttrouble. I mean, my mum ends up with orange knees and orange hands and stuff, and at the beginning of May it is blatantly obviuos it is fake! Plus, I look ill (apparently) any way, so people will just have to accept me for what I am!! Nicki, Jackie, (and perhaps even Max??!!), are yoi going to be using fake tan? I know loadsa girls in our class have been on sun beds already, but there isn't a better way to fry your skin than to go on a sun bed, so that is a definite no-no. Anyway, I am just soooooooooooo excited about it all! I mean, for most of us, this is our first real chance to dress up in really posh clothes and act all posh and have a posh meal with our friends and ride in limos and scream adn dance all night wihtout our parents being there! Wooooooooooooohhhoooooooooo!!1 I am so excited!! You boys will have to time it so that we arrive at the same time as you  (near enough!), so we can all go in together as one   phat   gang!! OMG i am so excited!! OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!! Yahhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey! Anyway, over-and-out from Jo-Jo!!!

       Well, I think pot noddles ae minging. basically. I agree with Jo, way to violent. It is making a mockery of Christianity. But yea Tom, that guy dancing is pretty amusing. Why is he killing them all anyway? Just to dance? How strange.  Anyway, I watched Ryan last night! Yaaaaay!  Debut on UK TV!!!!! Waaaaaaaahhhhhhoooooooo!!!!!! He died.                                                     That was relaly scary actually because you could hear him screaming and I was like nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Mind you I actually screamed at one point because the alien dude scared the bejeebus outta me. I'm so silly, I spend the whole program hiding behind my hands. LOL. Now I am off to town soon to go shopping, with Angela and Jo C. Hoepfully. If they turn up. I hope. But first I must go post on el forum. Chal.

Been making green sites with Tom, eating pot noodles as soon as I get up, putting myself to sleep with chocolate, flicking water at Jackie and proving to Mr Gallagher that chewing helps me to think. I have also seen a few incredible things like Nicki drinking from a David Brent mug, Andy and Jackie breaking a safety screen and people climbing D-block with hockey sticks (and me falling off and nearly breaking my back). I have just given my parents 20 to go and buy me the DVD Ratrace when they go shopping. So no prizes for guesssing what i'll be watching when I go to bed. I have a few pieces of homework, English, Science, Tech and um, somthing else. I'm not gonna write a long blog, as they get boring. Byedibye.

       Well I have done all my homework (only one piece to do) and watched a film, Cool Runnings. Love that film. LOL. Now I am listening to all these clips I have downloaded from the inertnet. How amusing. Tonight Taken is on so I WILL be watching that. Not that anyone else will, apart from Andy probably. I'm off to town tomorrow with Jo C and Angela to spend my vouchers. Will it be fun? We'll have to wait and see. So, other than that. Chal for now.

       I went to the prom dress shop this moring and tried loadsa dresses on, it was soooooooooo fun! I'm now really excited about it all, but I have to wait till the end of February when she gets all her summer stock in b4 I buy anything. But anyway, I tried on some really pretty dresses and stuff, and it was quite a battle! There was this purple thing that was high at the front, and had criss cross straps, and I got totaly tied up in it, and the shop owner had to rescue me from it, it was quite embarrasing!! But anyway, that's me for you! It was this really nice little shop with posh clothes, no-one in there apart from the shop owner, and she picks out stuff that will suit  you, it's really cool! I thik that I'm going to go for a 2 piece, with a full (er) skirt and a boned-top (strapless) cos I tried this purple one on and it looked really good (even if i say so myself!), but it was too big, so it was being held in at the back! I'm going to go back when she has her new stock, and get one in a smaller size, and they do alterations and stuff there. BUT I am sooooooooo excited about it all, it was just such fun (apart from when I got stuck!!). Anyway, I'll stop rabbiting and go and do something useful!! Talk to ya later guys!

       Now, how many of you have ever wanted to know how Cruise Missiles Work? Well I found it along with many others at  How Stuff Works  ( How Cruise Missiles Work ) and it is rather interesting, everything from cameras to chocolate - a site for looking at when your bored. What have I been doing recenatly? Not a lot really. Just general things that you normaly do in January. I don't really have the energy to blog right at this point in time, and I really don't have a lot to anyway. I want something interesting and exciting to happen, soon - getting a bit bored at the moment. Have a good weekend people. When something happens I will tell you all about it.

       Maybe you s hold get your eyes tested nicki? Cos I had headaches a lot when I was younger, practiaclly every day, and it turned out i needed to have glassses cos my eyes strain too much. And anyway, its probably that you're stressed!  To be honest, I cacn't remeber nething about fame Academy (i onl watchewd a few), but i know i wanted Sinead to win, and I don't even remember who Ainsley was! Was he the black dude, or am I getting confuzzled with Ainsley Harriot? Um, dunno! oh, and I have just noticed it is Ainslie. But never mind, can't be assed to chgen it all!  I have watched very  little tv recently, only on the day i was off ill when I watched MTV and saw TATU's viedo (quite disturbing, not that i have nehting against lesbians, just its a bit disturbing). Anyway, tooooooooodles!!

       Pah. Yesterday was a bad day. I really could not be bothered to blog but I am blogging now so hopefully something I say may get othes to join in! I have a thumping headache btw. I have had all week. In fact its got me slightly worried. I mean, is it normal to have a headache everyday? Didn't Dr Greene on ER have lots of headaches before they figured out, that he, um, had a brain tumour? Crap.  But I mean like I wouldn't rule that out! Tumours are cancer yea? Well I think everyone in my family have died of some form of cancer. Pants. What a nice thought huh!  Well, on the TV just now they played all the fame acadmey videos. David, Sinead and Ainslie. Out of all three I must say that Ainslie has the best song and the video is quite nifty. It would be funny with Ainslie in the USa, they would not like him! I mean, he sometimes has on nail varnish but I think when performing he has just a hint of eye make up on. Which I don't mind. I think personally that if a guy has like eyeliner on it can make them look quite sexy.... or maybe that is my gothic side coming through. LOL.

       Well yoga has all different levels. From begininger to advanced. I guess when you start it you would feel silly becaause you aren't flexible but I guess the more you practise the easier you will find it to relax and once you relax the eaiser it wiwll be to become more flexible. And at the same time it improves your daily mood and way of dealing with things. :) Good way to chill out too. I'd like to try it actually although i know I said to Tom its silly but I have changed my mind. LOL.

       Go to that flexible club thingy, according to Laura it was good and she's gonna keep going, and there was only a few people there, so it was okay she said!  Other than that, I don't wanna sound rude jackie, but where would u put a trampoline? And where would u use it during the iwnter months? And when it rains (whihc is 2 outa eveyr 3 days in the UK!)

       Our limo has been left in the hands of Andy to sort out, so I think I might give him a nunge to get it going if people are getting booked up. I will blog more tomorrow, I started to late.

       He he he!!! WE have a limo bookedf, and it was affordable!! huuuuuuuuuuuuuge thanks to Natalie on that one! Yeah, i did my own enquiries tonight, i phoned numerous taxi services which had pretty crappy cars at high prices, and i phoned 7 limo companies, 4 of which were already fully booked for May 9th, the other 2 were veyr expensive, and one didn't answer the phone, Pah! But at least we r sorted with it!, and Jackie and NIcki, MY LIMO BUDDIES!!! How exciting! But yeah, I expect by May we will be too vbusy with revisio and stuff than to spend hours trapsing round lookming for dresses. I will get my dress asap, and do jewellery etc at a later date, i thinks! Ooooh, I'm so excited I cant think of nething else to sya, except tiiiiiiiiiiidles people!!

       Well the 'rents can be surpirsing. Maybe if you make a deal or something with them and say that you will try and save up even if yu only contribute a small amount. You never know! Good luck with it anyway :) I hear what you are saying about the prom thing. I mean pople need to book limos now because they will be gone by the time it comes around and I guess it same with the dresses, its best to get them early. I think everyone has just been in a leavers ball mood this week! I guess the phase will pass but it is someting nice to look forward to.

       ahhhhhh my parents ! As you may know i want a trampoline, now i have asked my parents for one as a joint christmas and birthday present. I have alos found one for 355 which is quite cheap for a trampoline, but all i get is No your not having one, No you dont need one and NO YOUR NOT HAVING ONE ! But the thing is i really want one and i know for a fact i would use it alot to practise on :( It is getting me really annoyed and frustrated and my birthday isnt until July ! lol. Anyway today was quite boring and i think i have really hurt my elbow cause when eva i hold something with that arm the elbow really hurts and is very painfull. But maybe im just a wimp ! And about the prom, its AGES away, why is everybody worring about it now? Im fed up of people going on aboutn it and who is going with who, we havent even been told where it is yet we have only heard rumours and stuff, we havent been told by the head of year or anything ! Knowing our luck it wont be where we thin kit is and it wont happen !lol bye

       Seeing as everyone has been talking about the ball for a while now, although not actually in the blog I thugh I would post up a few tips, for the girls anyway: (These are from my sister and from american prom sites I have been on)  After purchasing your dress, customise it with a elegant belt or maybe add decoration to teh dress itself depending on your sewing skills. That way, if someone turns up wearing the same dress as you at least yours will be slightly different, if not better.  Don't put on bright make up!!! Keep it simple and beautiful.  Earrings which dangle usually add to the elegance. According to  urlLink this  American prom site we should do the following:  4 Months Before Prom...  Make a checklist.  Find out how much money your parents will contribute.  Start saving money if necessary.  Pick out that special dress (put it on lay-away if necessary).   3 Months Before Prom...  Begin to maintain your hair and nails.  Pick out your accessories to coordinate with your dress.   6 Weeks Before Prom...  Purchase your Prom tickets.  Make an appointment to have your hair, nails, and makeup done.  If you are doing your own hair, start trying out different styles.  If you have not been asked for a date yet, check to see if the one you would like to go with has asked anyone, or ask a close friend before its too late. You can also go with a group of friends and have just as much fun and sometimes more.  Discuss your plans for Prom with your parents.   4 Weeks Before Prom...  Start wearing your Prom shoes around the house to break them in.  Pick up your Prom dress.  If you havent already done so, introduce your Prom date to your parents.   2 Weeks Before Prom...  Confirm all reservations and appointments you have made for the day and night of Prom.  Take care of last minute details: pantyhose, film, etc.   Prom Day  Pick up your dates boutonniere.  Go to your hair, nails, and makeup appointment(s).  Put some extra cash in your purse.

       I'm not leaving u out, and anyway, I didn't organise it, MIchelle asked me if Donna and I wanted to go in a limo with her, so we said yes. Anway, I did make a blog, but I could not for the ilfe of me work out how to format it, so i deleted it again! I was ognna try and teach myself HTML or whateva, but I couldn't! Never mind.

       Ah, now you see this is exactly what I mean when I say that I would get left, I already am being left out. People are organizing groups etc.. to go with in limos and stuff yet no one has asked me. I mean I happy to help out organize a little group but I don't want to be like THE one who does.  No, I don't think I will go to the ball after all.  Has anyone else made any other blogs no wthey have an account? If so what are they and I can link them to your name above instead of email or other sites.

       Well as I said anyway I am usually free as I don't have much of a social life. The dates I now I am out on are next weekend, March 15th and I am away at half term. That is the best I can do unless you want dates for half term? I leave on the Sunday come back on the Friday. Happy now?  And for anyone in the blog or anyone who reads the blog and thinks that the war on Iraq won't happen I will now quote George Best who I think has put this extremly well:  I wish all these people who are dithering about whether or not we should invade Iraq would stop wasting valuable oxygen. We  will  be going to war against Saddam Hussein, it's as simple as that. It's pretty obvious that the Americans have already made up their minds, and I'm glad they have the guts to do it.  And it goes on from there. And also please keep in mind that  you cannot prepare and prevent war at the same time .  [EDIT]I FOUND THE PICTURE! Its a picture of Ryan Merriman an dtis alien kid he tries to save for episode 4 of Taken, he gets killed, they both get killed, in a fire:  urlLink HERE .

       Oh dont worry, ignore that section of my last post.  I am trying to get an appropriate date for EVERYONE, so if I say, for example, 12th Feb, 3 out of 10 people may come, whilst if a small survey is carried out, then the maximum amount of people can come.

       What the hell are double line breaks? You don't need to post  like this. A simple new line is fine and much easier to read. It doesn't take up as much space either. And about skating, just tell me the date your going and I will tell if I can go or not. Its much easier that way. I don't usually go out anyway. I'm not socialble, really. I am out next weekend, hopefully I'll be in Croydon with Angela spending my vouchers. Or maybe I will buy a train ticket and go all the way down to lands End and back.

       Ack ack ack. I'm so bored. Just got back from the IWM which was okay, the bit I liked best was the 'secret war' exhibit about MI5 and MI6, and also the Post 1945 conflicts exhibit, mainly because although i think the wars were terrible tragedies, they don't really interest me all that much, I prefer modern stuff. So yeah, I had an okay day. Now I feel very car sick, and i had forgotten i had so much homeowkr, otherwise i would have done it yesterday and not left it till this evening!! Ooops. Oh well, off to finihs writing baout water boards. What fun.

       Can everybody give me dates that you CANNOT come ice skating. I will work out the most appropriate date for everyone then.   P.S: Includes weekends and inset days up til the half term in February.   Nicki, did you turn off double line breaks in this blog?

       Jackie, yea lets do that on msn. Max, fair enough but it would be handy if you could post brefly in the future to say 'I may not be on here for a few days' like Jo did earlier and that applies to everyone. Then we know where everyone is and I don't start thinking that this was a waste of time. No Tom I haven't seen LOTR and I don't want to. Oh and please don't write Ryan with " around it. He is a person not someone I have made up so don't talk about him as if he isn't real. And yea he is the Ryan I was talking about. I don't exactly know any others do I?

And you wanna get inside my head do ya ? I wouldnt want to, its full of crap and useless information that i have pickeed up in my childhood. lol. Anyway can someone else try and do the 2 questions i set please?

       *Sigh* You know I can't believe you asked that Tom. How many times have I told everyone who he is? About a bzillion. Thsi is just proof that people don't listen to me. Ryan Merriman is an upcoming actor, he has been atcing since he was a kid. He is known at all in the UK. I only know of him because when I went to Florida last year they were premiering a new film of his on zoog disney and I watched like 7 times. It was a brilliant film. So when I got home I looked him up on the ineternet and now I am a solid fan. Happy now or do I have to explain what zoog disney is as well? Armagedon has excellent graphics, it is not a silly movie. Just because something like that hasn't happened doesn't mean it can't etc.. so chil out and just watch it and admire Ben Affleck. Don't worry anyone, you don't have to watch Taken just because I asked people too or the fact that I have been reminding people since a week before the first episode. You are the ones who are missing out on a excellent program, by the makers of Band Of Brothers. No Jackie, you don't have to blog everyday. But it would be handy if people can try and blog at least every 2/3 days. Please.  If you could be one person for the day who would you be?  I'd like to be Ryan Merriman just to see what its like being him as he is filming a vew show at the moment. Or if I had to be a female it would be Jackie because I wouldlove to get inside her head.... :) Jo, yea you can pay 20.  I have another question for you all can you name one boys and one girls name for every letter of the alphabet?  A-amy B-belinda C-caroline D-dina E-erica F-felicity G-gemma H-holly I-isabel J-joan K-katie L-linda M-mary N-nicole O-olivia P-patrica Q- R-racheal S-shelly T-tina U- V-victoria W-wendy X- Y-yasmine Z-zaniah

       Good evening. He's just a boy, and I'm just a girl, can I make it any more obvious? We are in love, haven't you heard, how we rock each others world?  Armagedon really is pants, and a bit silly. I did not enjoy that movie, sorry. Girls, please explain, why are bras done up at the back, and not at the front? This evening, I went to a rather amsuing performance of Puss in Boots which Jo has been talking about, and it was very good - highly amusing. A few lines where wrong here and there, but it was all a good laugh. Nicki - who is Ryan Merriman?

       I'm here Nicki! Sorry I haven't been blogging much at all (and I can probably speak for Dave here too), but we have both been at panto every night this week till about 11pm, and by the time I have got home I have been knackered, and not had time to blog! So I apologise for me, and I am betting that David's reason is the same! I actually watched it last night (eveyr other night i have been changing scenery) , and it was hilarious! The Dame (who is always brilliant) messed up the end so much. They were singing this song about  'Where's the Cat'  to the tune of Robin Hood, and he came in at the worng time, so eveyrone was singing different things, and then he said " right, after 3" but ewhen he got to 3 they were in the wrong place in the music, so he had to say "4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9" really qyicly, and it was so funny! Also, they got the whoel audience stadnign up and sitting down in time to the music, and some bloke got totally out and stood up at totally thew wrong time on his own, and everyone laughed at him sooooooooooo much! Even the Dame started laughing, whcih he usually doesn't do (they're not supposed to laugh!). Other than that, the usual panto 'hitches' have happened (including the princess not turning up on cue, and then not appearing for a few minutes after that too!), but generally it is all a good laugh and everyone has a wail of a time! I have also made some new freinds, which is rather nice.  PANTO PARTY  next weekend, guys!" yay! Can't wait! Hah ha ha ha.  FREDDIE AND CHIRS. Ahem. Nicki, Are you sure you don't mind if I pay 20? I will pay monday, if that's okay. Yell if it isn't, or whateva!

       Max you are participating more than Dave but you kinda stopped cos of the argument you and Jackie were having. Anyway, its not friday anymore its Saturday. What does that mean for moi? Hmm, homework and cleaning my room which is disgustingly dirty and messy. Thatway I get tomorrow to 'relax' as Goff says. If you didn't get that when I asked her what she up too in the summer holidays it was 'nothing much, just relaxing' then I ask what are you going to do on holiday? 'Relax'. Bless. I am going to Croydon next weekend with Angela hopefully. I have vouchers to spend and hopefully I can get a computer game I have wanted for ages. I prefer games like the Sims where youa ct as god. LOL. Like Rolocoaster tycoon etc... I prefer them than fighting games. I reckon there are way too many of those games out, I mean how many can you possibly make! They are all the same! Your character justs goes around shoots and blows up people. Yea... that is why I like manger type games. You can make the Sims do so many things! You can design your own rolocoasters and see if people like them etc.. Much more mind stimulating I reckon. What things have I got to look forward too? Freddie Prinze Jr. and Chris Klein! Yay. And at half term I'm going on up to Norfolk to see my Auntie. I already know one day we are going up to this posh country club like we did before for a dinner. I love country clubs. they are so countrylike and posh. I already said that but they are. Honest.  Where is Jo nowadays? I mean I know she is helping her friend at the panto but now its the weekend! Shes gotta blog at some point, hasn't she? Hey guys, don't forget,  09:00PM - BBC2 - TAKEN . Watch it, please. Pleeeeeeease. Although its episode 4 I am waiting for when my love is in it. :)

       Good evening. How can this be? Why can this be? There is no other way, this can be the only way.   IT'S FRIDAY!  Come one people! Party! No? I know, it's misserable, it's January, it's cold, it's wet, it's annoying, and generaly, it's shit. There really isn't any other way of putting it.  Something to look forward to, I think my mum and I may be going to the lake district in the Easter holidays for some walking, yay!  Anyway, blog lots over the weekend, have a good one guys.

       I said to you as I emailed Dave, if you do not participate in the blog before Sunday you will be removed because there are other people I could invite to join who will blog. I had a crap day today and can't be bothered to moan about it right now.  I made someone happy today. That is something I am trying to do each day. I will be sending a video to a girl in Brazil. She can't get programs which Ryan Merriemn is in there so I am recording Taken for her so she can watch it. Shes now really happy. And these are some of the reasons why I wish to go to Antartica on a cruise:  urlLink 001   urlLink 002   urlLink 003   urlLink 004   urlLink 005   urlLink 006   urlLink 007

       Good evening. That was my brother lost in the rubble. That was my sister lost in the crush. That was our mothers, those were our children. That was our fathers, that was each of us.  Today was a normal day, for me. Not for others. Poor Jo wasn't a happy bunny this morning, so she went home, and I can't blame her really, the poor thing, being cold and tired isn't nice. I am sure she is nice and warm tucked up in bed fast asleep. Lisa hasn't had the best day as some of you know, but I won't go into detail on here. But, not to worry, because tomorrow is Friday, and also as Mrs Crouch reminded me, we are ever getting closer to February!  I really don't know what to say, so if I haven't got anything to say, I might as well just go.

       Ok, I thought it was clear but I obviously have to state it again. To anyonoe who is a friend of mine, I am a good listener. If people ever need to talk weather it be to moan or be angry, cry or just rant and rave I will listen. If they then want an opinion or suggestion on what to do about it I will try. If they want any help, I will try. I seem to have a knack of cheering people up as well which is always useful. And if the thing they rant about or want to get off their chest and tell me is a big secret, if they ask me to keep it a secret I will. i always have done, and I always will. So people, if you need someone to listen I AM HERE!!!! People forget that!!!!  Now that is said, my day? PSE was amusing with that homosexual video but when Miss Reid tol dus about that Major from the army coming in to talk to us I was like "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAA". Wooooo! Then 2 hours of English back on back, hmm, it was ok I guess. We had to do a mini-presentation on a poem which I found funy in my gorup. I mean Sean and Pat were in it! But I admit it, I do make judgements on labels etc.. no matter how much I tell people not to judge grungers just because of the musi cthey listen to and stuff because I judged Sean on the fact of who he hung aorund and he is a pretty nice guy. I was wrong, I admit it. Then we had lunch which was fantabulous wth our whole blockading the tech block in. LOL. Sooo funny! After lunch what did I have? Sciene! With Mr Gallagher, we made progress today. Now he knows my name...usually its simply 'Michelles friend' or 'Jackies friiend'. Heehee. Then German which is never that amusing anyway. So. Yup. There we go.

       Good evening, I been knocked down so many times, counted out 6, 7, 8, 9. Written off like some bad deal, if you're breating you know how it feels, call it karma, call it luck, I just don't give a  I never knew Virgin radio could be so dirty, extreamly dodgy stuff going on at this time, all kinds of things. Tune in after 10pm to 105.8 FM. It is the 16th of January, which means we are half way through the month, which means it's nearly February!  At this present moment in this thing we call "time" I am extreamly annoyed with myself, I really don't understand what is going on. Teachers keep telling me that I need some help, and then they decide that I need to work harder and that I don't really need any help, so I have no idea what to do, and it's rather annoying.  Jackie, tell all, I do, and look what happens. It is perfectly okay, we arn't exactly going to take the mick or anything, and so what if somebody sends an e-mail? I know people talk about me for different reasons (mainly bad things) but so long as I don't hear it, I don't mind. If I where you, I would get it all out of your system and really go for it. My problem is I never have anybody to talk to, there are so many things I want to say, but I really don't want to bore people with it, but I really want somebody just to listen. I am trying to convince myself of this as well, but here is a theory of mine; You are born, and then you die, and anything in the middle is a bonus. So I am going to live as long as possible, and if I muck it up, oh well, I am hardly going to be regretting it when I am dead because I won't be able to think.  Are we all in touch with the news? We are sending the biggest ship in our Navy to join the rest of the guys in the Gulf. The thing that is really annoying me, a question that Charles Kennedy raised, if the USA go to war, but the UN don't - will the UK? I personaly believe that if the UN say we should go to war, then we should "join in" and go along with it, otherwise we are going to be the misserable Brits who don't do anything. However, if the UN say "no" to war, and the USA go to war, we should definatly not go with them. Without UN backing, they are making an offensive move as Iraq haven't exactly attacked the USA.  But we don't need to talk about rubbish such as war? We need to be happy and smily, even if we are in tears. I need to dream, and I have just remembered, I haven't answered Nicki's question about honeymoons. For my location, like I said, I really want to be somewhere different and unique. Away from anything else, just completely me, my wife, and nothing else. Perhaps a deserted island? Something with beatuiful scenery, next to a beach, blue waters. For the perfect wife? I am not fussed about looks and colours, blue or brown eyes, dark or light hair, I don't mind, I have the same preferences as most people, big clear eyes that you can just stare into for hours on end. They have to have a good sense of humor, enough to make me laugh, however beable to be completly serious at other moments. She has to like active sports so we can go to interesting places walking and things. I really want to do some back-packing somewhere, like in India. Anyway, I could go on for ages...  Life is rather dull, January is always like this, nobody can really be bothered to do anything. Once we get into February and half-term, people will start to pick up again, and then it's home free 'till Easter, then that's it, pretty scary. I am curently sorting myself out for work after I have finished my GCSE (last one is on the 25th June I think) - what is everybody planning to do over the holidays? Remember, you have two months free.  Good night all.

       well what a fun day i had today ! 1. boys are assholes, you tell them something in confidence then a couple of weeks later you find out that half of their mates know and possibly half of the school as well. 2. Max your outta order i neva said you could tell anyone bout wot i said and that is why i didnt say anything to anyone else. 3.Im really pissed off today 4.Im not gonna tell anyone anything about how or feel or whats up with me from now on cause it will end up somewhere like an email inbox 5.Is life worth living? Is Ilife worth being born? Is it worth me being around? 6. No one cares about me and i wish i wasnt here

       Hmm. I can see you have put a lot of thought into it. However my thoery seems to work too. I mean, thepeople I care about in the way I think you mean don't care about me in return, someone don't even know who I am or have even heard of me! Now that can get you depressed...or you choose not to be. There are choices everywhere in your daily routine yea? Wheather to get up now or in five minutes, eat this or that, drink this or that, do this or not etc... So if someone doesn'r care for you in return you can either choose to be depressed or choose to be happy and just be glad they are your mate or something. See what I'm saying? And anwsering my own question from earlier: for my honeymoon I'd go on a cruise to the Antartica and my perfect husband? A bit of you-know-who mixed with a bit of you-know-who and then some of you-know-who. Perfect.

       Good evening. Don't point that hamster at me! lalalalalalalala dadadadadadad Today, in my little world, I discovered that being insane helps despression, or so says my camel, Steve. Life is shite. That is a fact, there is nothing I can do about it. No matter how hard I try, no matter what I do, things will always turn out for the worse. No matter how deap my bomb shelter is, or how many weeks worth of food we have. It doesn't really matter how many friends I have, and it doesn't really matter how much I talk to everybody. Nobody really cares about anything anymore, so why should I care about stuff others don't care about? Well I do, because I care. Now, caring about careing sounds a liitle odd, and you are all probably thinking "what is Tom smoking?" but no, I am have a strong theory. When you care about things, you think about them, which usualy makes you depressed. Think about that for a second, if you care you are thinking about it, which makes you depressed, unless you are one of the lucky ones where the person you care about cares about you. But other than that, you get depressed. Now, because you care, you keep thinking, so the best thing to do is to care about caring. Care for your care, keep caring about caring, and eventually you will care for nothing, only caring for others. Does that make sense? Perhaps I should draw a diagram.     Does that make some sort of sense? Simply, if you care about caring, you care for all, if you care for one, you only care for one.

       I'm here ma Chris friend!! I thought I had alread blogged todayt but i just have imagiuned it! Strange, eh? Anyway, i guess thaty's why I'm at home, cos I don't know what I'm doing today! Nah, I did take the day off not because I am ill, but I couldn't face over 2 hours with a certain tecaher, but I can't even remember her name now! Silly me. But anhway, thursday afternoon i will be happy and smiley JO (or as happy and smiley as I get, ha ha), and I will be until parents evening, when meine mutti is gonna turn the tables on that teacher whose name I can't remember, and i don't remember what she said to me yesterday either. It's all done and dusted.  So, basically I went back to bed having got up for breakfast, and slept in until about  10am, got up and wandered around for a bit. Had lunch at 12,  toastie cheese!!!  Um, then did a bit more of nothing, then watched neighbours, then put some very loud Eric Clapton on in my lounge, until my mum came home. She actually suprised me today, cos she thought I was actually ill, wheraas my dad got suss straight away (usually he doesn't pay any attention to my 'illnesses', but today he came to 'chat' cos he knew I wasn't ill). However, he wasn't cross or nething, I just said that I was entitled to take days off now and then, and he said as long as I am not gonna start doing it all the time, like a certain other member of my family. Ahem. So yeah., I oh crap. no. I was about to say I have just come back form my music lesson and am cooking my tea, when I suddenly remeber that I put my potato in the oven, and never took it out again. So I now have a very solid baked potato. Never mind. Charcoal, all the same. Um, and I am off to panto and 7.30, to help shift scenery around! I shall be doing that all thsi week, so I won't be on messengert after 7.30 every evening, nor will I be blogging or answering my e-mails. Just to warn you, in case you think I have all dissappeared.   not that ne one would notice, of course.    So, see you tomoorrow guys. I think it will be safe to put in an appearance tomoorow. As long as I am not going to be head hunted.

       Well boy did I have a bad day. Although you could say bad afternoon really. The whole us lot getting banned from the tech block has really peed me off, I mean, we don't exactly trash the place!!!!!!! Grrrrr. Where are we suposed to go now though huh? Our old corner? Thats a bit cold and wet. Ew. Fair enough if it were sunny but helooooooo this is england! We don't do sun! Much. Then bloody Chris in english flicking that candy off those candy necklasses thing. He was trying to hit Lee but got me instead an dit bloody well stung like mad. If I had looked up just at that moment it would've got me in the eye. Then when I anwsered Sir's questions and it took like ten minutes just for people to write it down. Geez. Now I am cream-crackered and wondering where our Jo has gone. Jo? Where you ma Freddie friend? And Jackie, I got ma Here On Earth DVD! Yay.

       Hello peeps, I am alive.  I do love this time of the evening. My father is sitting in the kitchen with some nuts and a beer, surfing the internet and writing e-mails. My brother is watching some strange programme from the 1980s on the Sci-Fi channel about this guy who can burn things with his hand (ouch?) and my mother is reading the newspaper and drinking her tea in bed - and this happens every single night. What do I do? Well I sit in here and type away on this thing all night before going to bed.  This is quite an interesting question you ask of us Nicki, our honeymoon? Well that is kind of asuming that we get married, and having a girl friend in the first place. So in a dream world lets say... First of all, the honeymoon. Well, as much as I loved Paris and other places like Prague, I would prefer to be somewhere unique for my honeymoon. I will explain all in the morning, it's too late. For my wife? Well let me make one thing quite straight, after previous experiences in that line of feild, she has to be more inteligent and an ape. I will explain the rest tomorrow as well.  Or I could be gay?

       Ollie has shoved a pen in her leg before...  Honeymoon, eh? Hmmm, I think a nice week or two in the Caribbian with you-know-who would be very nice. Need I say more?  Cinema. Im gonna have to think about that one. If its going to be organised so late that its gonna be during the half-term, I cant come because I will be in America.  P.S: Tom seems perfectly fine. I passed him on the way to geography today, and we both made a strange noise when we passed. Insane as usual. I think he is just doing his homework and coursework, which reminds me....english homework has to be in tomorrow! Aaaaa, look at the time! Byebye.

I mangaed to get his password and was then logging in so he turned my computer off, i did this twice and then it said that contact eh operating person cause his grace log ins had run out ! So he was pretty angry and then he shoved a pen into my back ! it well hurts now ! :( Well slightly later after our lesson i slapped him round the face cause he tried stabbing me again ! hehe well anyway a honeymoon, well no where cause im not ever gonna get married cause no one would eva fancy me or would want to go out with me

       Um, honeymoon would have to be somewhere quiet and romantic, maybe the middle east or somewhere (an Island of Thailand maybe?), as there are clear waters, nice sun, beautiful scenery, and you could just do nothing for 2 weeks or whateva! Would be bliss, I bet! And my perfect man would be tall, dark and handsome, with a wicked sense of humour, kind, inteligent and motivated!! COuldn't stand someone who just sits of hsi bum all day and never does anything! How about you, Nicki? AND answer it with no references to Ryan, Josh HArtnett or Chris Klein!!! Or anyone else famous, for that matter! Pure fiction here, deary!

       Hey Jackie, it's the mother of all stomach aches!!!!! Anyways, Tom didn't blog last night/this morning which is very unusual indeed. He better be at school today or I will get seriously worried. I hope it is simply that he hasn't had the time.  So onto maybe more fun topics, if you guys (and girls, heehee) could go anyway and I mean anywhere for your honeymoon where woul dyou go? Ooo, and who would your perfect husband/wife be?

       He hasn't really been on MSN all week, nor has he been on it since friday, both of which I find quite bizarre. Also, he usually blogs every day, and I don't think he has been on snooboo for a day or two. Hope he hasn't lost the will to live already, we're not supposed to do that until we actually get our GCSE results. No, I'm joking, where the hell is he? Hope everything's okay. I will come and see 8  mile if other peeps r going too!

       The blue writing is a link, for example  urlLink this blue writing here is a link to the bbc if u click on it . Does that answer one question? NAd btw, haven't a clue what safe mode is! On the other hadn, it looks like safe mode shows u the HTML of the page, so for example you can see the link written out properly, and each line break has the html for the line on it (minus the space, of course) . I think.

       S'all good. Freddie Prince Junior, I'm on my way to ya honey!!! Wooooooooooooohhhhhhhhoooooooooooooooooooo!!! OMG OMG OMG OMG. OKay, Sorry. Got tat outta ma system now I can calm down abit. Right right. I've just bought a load of books in a shop in caterham, cos I am gonna try and learn some Spanish before I go on holiday. I bought one of those CD-rom teaching type thingys this morning, but it doens' tell you the alphabet or the numbers or anything as basic as that, so I just went and got an everyday phrase book (typical touristy thing) and a voccab tool book. Whilst I was there I als found the last book in a series of superb books that I have read, and I bought a german phrase book for my trip to Austria with the music department! Das ist kaputt.Look at this:  "Eine Ruckfahrkarte erster Paris, bitte" how silly is that? Aking for a train ticket to a place in france, in german. Right. And don't say you can get a train from Germany to PAris, it is a bloody long way and would be a bit silly to do! Spiegeleier mit Zuckererbsen, bitte. Ha ha ha!!Die nummer funktioniert nicht. Ich habe verstopfung!! Ooooh!! I bet you canm guess that last one just by looking at the last word 'verstopfung! Achtung vor dem Hund!!! Mquah ha ha ha. OKay, I'm sorry, I'll shut up. It's just that, well, um, you see............. FREDDIE PRINCE Jnr!!!! and of course, for Nicki- CHRIS KLEIN!!!

Anyway, the London thingy, I would love to go, just my mum won't book it cos she always ends up booking the tickets for things, and she has a lot to pay off on her credit card at the mo, oweing to Chrsitmas and our next holiday and all!

        Am I right in thinking this is a blog where you put down your feelings and stuff that has happened during the day?  Yes. That is right. The reason I don't want people slagging each other using the blog is because that is all that will happen. People will just sit here and diss people. If I let you and Max slag each other off now then you wouldn't be talking probably, ie: your previous post. You'd still be slagging each off. Fair enough if people don't get along but slagging each other off all the time isn't gonna help. I should know, just look at Lisa and I! Do you see where I'm coming from?  I am putting off my history coursework until tomorrow. Its all confused me, i don't feel we have done enough work on it. I mean for our Vietnam one we did like a terms worth of research etc.. So far we've had what, five/four lessons on it? Well. Tsktsk. And Jo, I relaly hope we can sort out that London thingy. I get hyper whenever i think about it! Heehee. And can we move the Imperial war Musuem trip to the next inset day? Ii am away at half term. Thats a point, what is everyone doing at half term? I'm off up to Norfolk to see my Auntie! Her house is so lovely. Actually, hers and Andy's are simelar! OMG, guess what I did thsi morning. I nearly choked to death [no, seriously I relaly nearly did!] on CORNFLAKES!!!!! That is outrageous! A few saturdays ago I nearly choked on a piece of rice while watching you've been framed and the evening before that I managed to get a chunk of chocolate stuck in my throat. I really should chew my food.

       Right, where did you get that info from Jo? If you got it from the front of that book, then you dont have to do the full course. (Dont take my word for that though). You should only be doing the full course if you have spoken to Mr.Parr about it. If not, complain.  Well, this will be my last blog of the week, as I will be going to America. See you folks!  P.S: IM GOING OUT WITH NIC.J!!! - I LOVE U!!!

       Then all of a sudden, a pellet goes flying through the animals head, sending him straight off the fence and into next doors pond. Looking across the garden, Andy is hiding there with his air rifle...       Wot a tosspot, killing foxes.  Fat Boy Slim is sad, all todays music is rubbish. Even my favourites like Puddle Of Mudd are total rubbish compared with Pink Floyd and other 80's rock.  Anyways, Ive got my job as a part time computer engineer! Yay! Ugh, the first task they set me was the one I hate the most. Replacing a hard drive and getting all the damn settings correct.

       I had a close encounter with one of the members of the fox family who live at the end of our garden. I think it was the daddy fox. Anywho, I was in the kitchen and he jumped onto the fence like our cats do as they jump from the drive to the patio. I mean this huge great big fox was on the fence! Amazing creature. He is in really good condition with a fluffy tail and a really nice orangy red coat. And he has huge ears!!! And lovely blue eyes. It was a bit scary when he looked dead at me though.

       That does explain it indeed. I haven't watched any of it yet. In fact I don't tend to watch particular channels, its the programs I'm after. Thinking about it now the channel I watch a lot is E4 with such great programs as ER, Friends, Smallville and many many more. Other than that I don't really have many other programs I watch other than The Royal. How fun. I am writing this at school by the way and Tom has a squeaky voice. LOLOLOLOLOL. That was funny eating lunch o 20 minutes ago as Darren and Jackie kept giving each other wedgies. Sooooooooooooo amusing.

       So Max, you don't like Johnny Vaughan? What about Dom Joly? Good stuff from Fat Boy Slim? Well the channel is designed for 20-30 year olds, so that could explain why you don't like it.

       Max watch your language please. Remeber, please only swear if you are extremly angry or peed off like Jackie earlier with his BS lessons. And I think it is up to Jackie what she does about it. I woudl suggest going to talk to Mr Johnston as he does actually do something about it but its her choice what she does. I just hope it works out for the better whatever happens and that what happens in her lessons don't affect her final GCSE grade.   "Halt, who goes there? BAAAAAAAAAA!" That is a quote from a very amusing true film based on the Apollo 11 mission, the film is called 'The Dish'. It is based in Austraila. We have uiton DVD and I think you guys should watch it someday. Put it this way: "Cliff! You just bulls***ed NASA!". Any film which lies to NASA has got to be funny. And anotehr film whcih is the total opposite of The Dish is Drive Me Crazy which I saw in 1999 with Angela. It is a good teen flick, which such lines as: "Well, I guess it's easy to be a bitch now that Brad's availabe again." "It's easy to be a bitch either way." and "Get drunk, have sex, be free... we're the class of '73!" and of course the great "Son are you stoned?" "Dad, wouldn't the correct question be, son are you ill?" along with ""I'm sorry Dave. I would have drove him home but I dunno how to drive a stick." "C'mon baby I'll teach you how....I got a stick right here!" "I meant a real car Eddie not a Matchbox!". HOW AMUSING!!!!!

       Max, you are not allowed to have an opinion of BBC THREE as you can't actually get that channel unless you got digital in the past few days. It is BBC Choice replacement, it has a couple of the programmes like Liquid News and 60 Seconds from BBC Choice, but also quite a few new programmes. It is 90% British made programming.  Also Max if we ski, we all ski together. Ski school is in the morning and afternoon, and if you want to you can ski after that for a little while. The slopes are 30 minute drive from the hotel. I have got 1 dodgy double audio jack and I am trying to buy another one.  Don't you ever get bored of watching The Office?  Jackie, nothing is going to happen unless you talk to somebody about it.

Plus when i went to pupil services some kid had thrown up about 3 times all down the corridoor. NOT NICE  It was all chunky and manky but there you go ! Bye for now, i may blog later.

Basically in simple terms...........listen to fat ****, or listen to Bon Jovi :) dont forget The Office is on at about 10:30pm out there :) BBC AMERICA! Talking about the BBC, that new channel 3 is rubbish! And your opinion is........?  Tom, got any double audio jacks to plug into the player for America?

       OOOOOOOOOO lookie. First to blog for today. Well, well, well. Chilli, baby back baby back baby back ribs. And that kinda sums up the day. We repeated that phrase for most of it. LOL. I stayed at school until 5 doing some art courseowrk. But while the teach was working on it for me I cleaned up her side and now it is all nice and neat. Fantabalo. However I did learn today that the RE and German speaking exam clash. So according to Westy those who miss speaking appointments during the exam get to be put in isolation until we have done it so no one can tell us what is in it. Brilliant. I've never been in isolation before.

       I had Kazaa for a little while (1 day) it wasn't really the viruses that I was worried about, but there was just so many adverts and other rubbish it just wasn't worth it.  Guns 'n' Roses - Sweet Child of Mine - have you seen the video to that? Haha! It was made when filming the camera crew filming the video was popular, and they all look like they need the toilet, and they all do stupid little dances when they haven't got anything to do. It's on  urlLink KERRANG!  quite a lot at the moment, look out for it.  If any of you have ever wondered how mice find good sex partners,  urlLink this is how .  Other than that I don't really have a lot to say. Apart from Max, everytime you play You Give Love A Bad Name I will play the Popcorn Dance Remix. Now, You Give Love A Bad Name is a great song, don't get me wrong, and Bon Jovi rules, but I have heard it enough times to last me 'till the Summer. So, Max, this is your warning. You Give Love A Bad Name vs Popcorn Dance Remix. If any of you haven't heard Popcorn, or the remix, just ask for a CD and I will give it to you. It's cool the first time, but after that, it's just pants. I do have another song somewhere which I made with some dodgy music software that I will have to put onto CD for the trip.  Hey guys! Are we already for some  urlLink Spice ? "All five Spice Girls are reported to be meeting up on Monday for the first time in five years. Some pop insiders are even claiming that the once-legendary girl group will talk about reforming." Own up ladies, who was a Spice Girls fan in the '90s? I know I was! Don't be shy Max... you know those footsteps at the begining of Wannabe bring back good memories.

       Those 'Simple Minds'  tracks are my favourites! www.kazaa.com is where to go for it. I have not downloaded a single virus off there (not without intentionally looking for it!!!) If you havent already got a virus checker, you can download a good one off kazaa (like mine :), or I can copy mine to a cd for ya. (Norton Anti-Virus 2003). My fave guns'n'roses track is 'Dont Cry'. Kewl song. Heavy. I like almost everything 80's. Mostly the pop/rock part. New pop is just a loada bollox (capital fm, kiss, etc are rubbish. I listen to Virgin radio)

       I have to take life more as a joke? Omg. I am not even gonna reply to that.   "We say that the time of death cannot be foretold, but in saying this we assume that it is hidden in some obscure moment in the not too distant future, never realising that it has any connection with the day already begun, this very day that is so certain, and has every moment planned in advance." "CARTER YOU DICK!!!!" "Because of you I am still alive, Thank you." "Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay." "Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me." "Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked up God to take down this plane...A REALLY fucked up God." "Well FUCK DESTINY!!!!!!!!!!" "You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by it's tail. Every single move we make,from the mundane to the monumental...the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of...is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.

Forget the illegalness :) of it because I have been doing it for yonks and the police are after FBI hackers, not general home users. Makes sense.  Hm, get some Nickelback on those CD's!!! As well as the Bryan Adams album "Reckless". Some specific Pink Floyd tracks perhaps, loadsa Bon Jovi as well.  Tom doesnt seem to know how much I will be plugging "You give love a bad name" on the ski trip......

       How do you know someone has seen Final Destination 2? They msn sign in name is: DEATH IS COMING. lol. Some of us went to see it earlier. Dave, Rich and Max got ID'ed and couldn't in! How rude! There was a bunch of year 9's in there because we saw Doe's bro. That is outrageous. Even Jackie got asked her age. Bless. Anywho, thsi is the review type of thing from the official site, if you haven't seen it and want to don't read, its a spolier, slightly:  For every beginning there is an end  Final Destination 2, the sequel to the hit 2000 supernatural thriller, finds Clear Rivers (Ali Larter) the only survivor of the crash of Flight 180 left alive. Locked away by her own choice in the perceived safety of a psychiatric hospital, Clear now lives in constant terror that Death is coming to claim her, as it did all her friends. Clear may be considered crazy, but she's not wrong. Death is moving toward suburban Route 23, heading south.  En route to a weekend getaway with her friends, Kimberly Corman (A.J. Cook) watches helplessly as a logging truck careens out of control and loses its deadly payload, setting off a horrifying chain reaction that leaves twisted metal and dead bodies in its wake  including her own. A moment later, Kimberly finds herself still stuck in on-ramp traffic, with a line of commuters she saw die moments before trailing behind her. It was only a vision. But was it also a warning? Shocked into action, Kimberly blocks the cars from joining the traffic on Route 23 as a young police trooper (Michael Landes) arrives on the scene. The commuters begin to honk and complain until Kimberlys premonition comes powerfully and tragically to life before their eyes.  Death tears up the highway in a massive pile-up, with those left on the onramp narrowly escaping with their lives. But Kimberly knows its not over. Death won't be cheated so easily. Now this random group of strangers, who in Kimberlys vision were all meant to die in the freeway disaster, must join her in a thrilling race against time and their own paralyzing fear to do what all but one of the survivors of Flight 180 couldn't  stay alive.  New Line Cinema presents Final Destination 2, from the same producing team behind the original film, Warren Zide and Craig Perry (American Pie I-III, Cats and Dogs), with Justis Greene (Mission to Mars, Ill Be Home for Christmas) serving as Co-Producer. Noted second unit action director David R. Ellis (whose work has been seen in such films as Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, The Perfect Storm and the upcoming Matrix Reloaded) directs from a screenplay written by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress, based on the story by J. Mackye Gruber & Eric Bress and Jeffrey Reddick. Returning from the first film are Ali Larter (Legally Blonde, American Outlaws) as Clear Rivers and Tony Todd (Candyman) as the mortician, Mr. Bludworth.

       Well recent posts have been saying something, then on a new paragraph changing subject and thats ok because it works. Its just rather annoying when people press enter as in enter for a new paragraph every time they start a new sentance!!  I am in such a good mood today. I'm not sure why. Lots of reasons I guess such as the fact that I am alive, my hair is curly today, its a nice morning, I'm going out with friends later, one week left until half term, my friends in other countries are so lovely, the pictures website has gone well and its all good as the americans would say. Talking of websites, Dave T has given me co-running the Year 11 Party Pics site, its just been re-done so go and check it out, tell me what you think. There are a few bugs we are sorting out  though.  urlLink Year 11 Party PIctures!!!

       I didnt think much of the new seats. Ok, so they were slightly more comfortable, but they didnt need to buy them.  I dont blog too often because there is nothing to blog about, I tend to say my own opinion on what someone has said (like i just did above). I got one valentine card, from Nic.J (can tell by the handwriting). I will blog once every two or three days, as there is no need to blog everyday. I just come on sometimes to look at recent posts.  The film will be good tomorrow, but I need to walk to Daves first (cant b assed to get the bus!) YAY! Then on Sunday i'm going bowling/croydon with Nic.J!!

I'mtrying, Jackie is trying so come on Tom, Jo and Max, blog!!!!!!!!!!  I didn't get any cards either not that I am bothered because I personally think v-day is a load of cobblers! Its just another excuse to feel special and for people to make money. So for people who don't get anything its worse. :( Anywho, I can't wait for tomorrow! I will probably hide behind someone during the film, I'm sure i'll get scared I always do when I see horror movie type of things! What did ya'll think of the new seats in assembly? Snazzy!!!!!!

       It was a story a teacher from my juniors school use dto say that she was in a feild, lost her car keys, asked God for them, looked down and there they were. There is also the story of the onion but I won't go into that now. I don't know why people aren't blogging, Tom has already he is busy so fair enough but Jo hasn't said anything so I may have to email her a warning saying that she needs to blog soon. I went to the careers convention at school earlier. Very helpful it was!!! I was chatting away to the lady at the army desk for about 20 minutes!!!!!!!! Then I spoke to the RAF for a while.

       I do listen to you but like i said you hadnt organised a time or anything and when i wanna see a film i want to see it and not wiat until 4 weeks after it has come out. And i dont commit myself to just oging with one person if i get another offer then i will go, i went with darren. Maybe you should set a date early then i wouldnt have gone to see that with darren i would of seen sometihng else. You gotta get in tehre early with me cause i go to the cinema all the time even if there is only me and darren.

       I'm suprised no one else has blogged today. Shocking. Max, that is short sighted I believe where you can see things up close but have trouble with things far away. Which is ok for driving I guess, not that any of us can drive officially yet.  Actually I'm really annoyed right now, I know that a number of you went to see 'Catch Me If You Can', I am led to believe Jackie and Jenny went. Thank you both of you, I guess people really don't listen to me, I'll repeat what I said to you both in January: 'I want to go see Catch Me If You Can, shall we go together in February' and you both said 'sure'.  Thank you, you have both just proved my point on how  no one listens to me .

        talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department.  Same for Mr.Hanson. Its like "oh, how is he doing in the I.T". Hehe.  Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  Probably Andy or Dave, Nic.J as well.  Ive forgotten what kinda sight ive got. I can see close up things easily, but looking far away looks really blurred.

        Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school?  That depends on what I do when I finish collage or uni. If I join the army then I would probably only keep in contact when I get leave etc... But other than that I like to think I'd keep in contact with Jenny, and Andy.   I had my opticians appointment today. very scary stuff. I am long sighted and have to get some glasses for doing school work etc.. They should arrive in roughly a week they said. The glasses are pretty nice. I think they make me look intelligent, ish. I am feeling relaly left out at the moment from our group. I know I am ill and that I couldn't go out even if someone asked me because I don't want to make my cold worse but no one even invites me anywhere. Although i must hand it to Jackie, as I talk to her now on msn she is inviting me to a film. I think.

       Well i didnt meet either of my targets from last year in fact i have got worse, and Tom at least you didtn have miss auld moaning at you saying how bad you did in ur RE test ( I got an F). Most of my grades from last year have gone down but i beleive that is cause last yea it was what we were attaingin in lessons not in bloddy exams when your under pressure ! I think these acedemic review days are a total waste of time espically for ur parents cause most of the time they just sit there and dont acually say anything unless they have a load of questions to ask. I got a phone call half way through my interview but me being good ignored it ! This years targets are to improve my science result to a B and to make a Structured revision plan and STICK to it ! lol Sod both of those targets ! Anyway enough said about bloodly school, i went to the cinema today to see catch me if you can, no offence nicki but it was quite boring although the storyline was good, it lacked action in my opinion but some films are like that so im not gonna complain. Question for you all : Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school? For me probably Darren buts thats cause we live so close to each other Anyway byebye

       Can't remember last years targets, and I can't remember this years targets. So good luck getting those sorted then. We spent 10 minutes talking about AS/2, how my GCSEs are doing, which subjects need what doing to them and then we spent the other 10 minutes talking about RE (Ms Auld is a RE teacher) and she was sooooo enthusiastic about it my mum and I both kept on looking at each other smiling because we where both thinking the same thing, she wants some good grades in her department. I think I might just write "Jesus" 400 times on the exam and see what happens.

       I met, ready, both of mine! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!! Now I basically have to attend maths and IT revsion clubs along with textiles and art clubs AND other revison clubs including science. Argh! When will these clubs end? Especially as they haven't begun!   Anywho, right now I am multi-tasking!! I am writing a blog here, writing a blog for my austrailan type o one I am on, talking to 2 people on msn, watching last nights ER for the second time, drinking a chocolate milk shake (and may I say how marvelous it is) and wiating for a text. Ooo! I texted Paul (aka the Walrus) earlier saying 'aww bless, hes cute even when he is talking to his form tutor'. But I cunningly text him when he went in for his talk thing! Mwahaha. Bet he didn't have his phone with him. Mind you, you'll only understand that last line or so if you post on the snooboo.com forum.  I am trying my hardest to be in a cheery mood and it seems to be suceeding, even though I'm ill and I wil keep reminding everyone of that until I get the sympthay I want. LOL.

       I had met one of my targets from last year, which was to improve my maths. My other target was to get the science grade up. Didnt acheive that.  This years targets.... 1. To sustain the maths grade 2. To get grade up in science 3. To continually read books for English  *Sticks finger up for No.3*

       I have got no idea who the first person on my MSN Messenger list was. What did I do today? Cleaned cars - do I have to go into detail? Yes? Okay... We cleaned cars to raise money for our trip to Brazil in 2004. Sarah, Sophie, Law, Christable, Helen, Andy, Owen, Matt and myself. Neil didn't turn up, well he did at the begining for his meeting and then went home. We cleaned lots of cars and got very wet and cold, but it was good fun and it will be worth it in the end.  According to researchers, people bring good fortune on themselves by following four basic rules: maximising opportunity; acting on intuition; anticipating good fortune; and taking an optimistic long view of life.

Althugh I am still as ill as a foot and mouth ridden cow I have survived the day to London, thank God for Lockets!!! Ah dudes!!!!! It was soooo much fun! Me and Dave had a good laugh and our seats in the theatre were excellent, about 6 rows from the front. the show itself 'Contact' was excellent. The lights, stage, script, costumes, dance was brilliant!!! I have found a new found love for a) going to the theatre and b) swing dancing. Fabbo. Now I can't wait for 'This Is Our Youth' Jo, now I know more of what to expect at a theatre I am not as nervous so: FREDDIE AND CHRIS!!!! WAHOOOOOOOO!

       Tom, grow your hair. I would like to see what you look like "Sam McEvilly" (sp?) style. :)  At the moment, my only letdown is a huge ulcer on my tongue. I bit it in english the other day with a loud "crunch". I cant eat at all. I dont get hungry. Oh well, saves on the shopping bill at least.

       Tom, your hair. I think, from my fashiony designery point of view that you should go for something different. Perhaps get it highlighted and than the sides a bit shorter than the top then you can do a bit of a mohegan (sp?), a bit like Joe Armfeild, perhaps.   I had the worst night last night. I woke up at midnight because Dave text me damm him!!! 4am and 6am. I ended up getting up this morning at 8.30am. Darn it. If we were at school today I would not be going in I tells ya. I have a bloody sore throat, a stuffy erughy nose, stuffed ears (everything is muffled) and I am cream-crackered (knackered). Argh, I hate bing ill but I am going out today anyway. Lets hope I don't cough or anything too loudly in the theatre. LOL. Have a fun academic review day everyone.

       My day today: ok bearing in mind I am ill with a sore throat that is murder to me.  Anyone notice how I've been strangely happy though? I don't just spend my days depressed etc... Well I think I have figured why! I have been wearing this necklcae which is a happy face which I got free as a gift from the Hard Rock Hotel I stayed in. I'm always happy when I wear it. Check my hotel out  urlLink here !! Its was so awesome, the swimming pool has an underwater sound system and every few nights they have like a DJ at the pool or a dive-in movie/concert. They showed Harry Potter when I was there. Excellent. Love it!!!

            urlLink      This is Big Brother. The application process for Big Brother 4 is now closed. Ladies and Gentlemen, prepare your selfs for another summer of complete and utter rubbish.  I'm sorry, but the first time was quite interesting. It was new, it was a bit of a laugh, it was okay - but this is getting silly. Please, not another summer of strange freaks in a house trying to prove them selves to be somebody they are not. It ain't good TV anymore. What is good TV? Well the new channel BBC Three is sounding quite a good idea. Fat Boy Slim is having his own programme, should be very good. BBC Three's indents are made up of this strange creature called Blob (the guy on the left) - it's a bit odd, but if you want to watch the indents, there are  urlLink available here . Clip 3 is a bit dareing, and the BBC will probably get lots of complaints, but never mind. Anyway, if you are interested, BBC Three launches on Sunday 7th February 2003 at 7pm.  Unfortunatly nothing exciting is happening to my life, it just seems to be everybody else with the "fun" (as they call it). So I really haven't got anything to say, I might as well live in a ditch. However, we do have something to keep us going...   four day weekend!   but I am washing cars for money to go to Brazil! So it's all good really.  Jo, you asked me about the different sized text? I have made you all a little guide to explain size etc  urlLink here . Any other questions, just ask!  G'night peeps!

I love that program, the newer ones are better I think. Although the old ones are funny in the sense that the Pete characters says 'mate' an awful lot. Perhaps he is related to Mr Dicks? Talking of Mr Dicks him and Westy have taken all teh text bokos leaving Mr Bradwell or whatever his name is 2. LOL. How amusing.

Lunch was funny' etc... then it would be so boring! And I mean BORING. Whereas at least with this we can also have a good debate and not just a silly argument.

       I know you hit me deliberatly around the head, that is why I said  'a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head' . Yea I said stuff but that is because of your attitude to this. After a few days I'm sure I'll stop, I always do unless your Lisa. Fair enough if you have been brought up like that but just because thats how your parents act doesn't mean you should too. You know you are your own person, not just some clone of others.

       Ah, now Nic is a person I love, you are correct in assuming I will be very upset if something like that was to happen. I did not know the people in that shuttle, so ok, my deepest sympathy goes out to their families. The space program can go to hell, what is the point in bringing little insects like mice into space?  I have been brought up not to care about much, i.e: I have had to sleep in a broken bed all my life apart from when I was in a cot or whatever it is called. I am told to shut up and put up about it. I have to live with that sort of attitude, so I personally grow up with it.  In case you are wondering, I hit you deliberatly around the head because you had constantly been talking about me in science and playing some card game and saying "Max is the arsehole", not forgetting you threw that thing that Andy had  twice  at me.

       Actually, you will only be removed for the following reasons:   If you use a large amount of swearing for no apparent reason   You are quite blantently aggravating people, on purpose   You don't post at all over a period of 2 - 3 weeks even after I have emiled of reminded you to blog  Just because I disagree with what you said doens't mean I'll chuck you off. I'd like to hear what other people think on it. By the way Max, I didn't mean to kick you earlier it was a reflex action for you hitting me delibaratly around the head. So what would I like your views on? Well, I found out late about Columbia and when I was talking to Max about it all he said was 'o well shit happens'. I find that very disrespectful and rude. Its isn't everyday a space shuttle which was on a very important mission is destroyed and its crew killed. I could understand if it were a car accident because they do happen everyday. Put it this way Max, (and to Nic or anyone else I don't mean to upste you or be rude) if someone you cared about, ie Nic, was killed weather it be a car accident or not you would be extremly upset and greviving and would not want people tos hurg and go 'o wel;l, shit happens'. Thats like saying it doesn't matter. Ist like their deaths don't matter, or the crash itself doesn't matter. What about their families? 4 of them were married, what about their children? They have to grow up without a dad and that is something extremly hard to do. Then theres the space program itself, that will be put on hold now for a long long time. There are people in space now from Russia. The space station, also a very important project, what will happen to that? This has an on going affect, its isn't just 'shit happens'.  Argh, why don't you guys think before you say things?  -edit- Excuse me Jo? How can you come on here saying how all we talk about is depressing stuff when throughtout today and past week or so whenever I talk to you your always depressed! And you never give me a reason either!  "You can't go around being all depressed all the time, life goes on"  ha, thats a bit rich isn't it. I thought we were good frineds, so how come you never talk to me.

        I would just like to point out Max that BBC News is paid for by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   Not quite. I didnt say anything about TV, I was refferring to newspapers.

       I would just like to point out Max that BBC News  is paid for  by you because you own a TV  Check mate... mwhahaha   I have newspapers starting from the year 2000 till present day of all important events, local and national - such as Prince Charles riding the tram!  Silence...   Found this from an amusing article called 'How to... study' in yesterdays Gurdian. "Studying is copying things from books, and revising and highlighting the nouns what you have copied. But remember, your teacher probably wrote the book you're copying from, though when you've reduced his life's work to one noun, he might not recognise it."  urlLink How to... study   What did I do today? Well this morning myself and Andy went skiing! But just before that we played with his ferrets, they are soooo smelly! But quite cute. The skiing was very good, soon as Andy worked out how to turn he was fine. Then this evening my family and I went to my grandparents for a meal and to talk about stuff such as house prices. Did you know that a 3 bedroom house in the year 1976 was 17,000? How much did your last car cost? Crazyness.  Anyway, my view on war if it has been said already there is no need to say it again. But seeing has everything has been said I want to say, I bid you good night and sweet dreams - I'm going to have a bath.

       Yes agree with what you are saying nicki but do you not think that they go slighly over board, I know septer the 11th was a very tragic day but do we still need to read about it in the paapers for the next month? I think not all that does is put us in bad moods and makes us afraid of going out, just think darren was in america when that happened ! Here you go nicki it is back again for ya !

       Now isn't this good, we are having a constructive debate nota argumentwhere peopel insult each other while swearing. How nice this is.  Perhaps they do go overboard but things like the recent Columbia crash will affect many things, like September 11th. War on Iraq will constantly be in the papers like it is now I guess but that will have a lasting effect. Some people like myself, like to read everything that happened ie: minute by minute, others don't but they have enough there for everyone I think. Plus your point about darren proves how its godo to know what is going on. Say your sister was in New York when that happened you'd want to know, even if you knew she was ok, what was happening and what was going on. So they are goo din that sense but yes, they do have it on the front page longer than people want to see it. I see your point.   -edit- Jackie just deleted her last post which this was replied to

       I agree Jackie, they do print more 'amusing' stories, or a wider range anyhow. I read the Daily Express. But when something like September 11th or the Columbia tradgey occurs I tend to read the Daily Express, Telegraph etc.. I also keep the papers for that day. I have about a bzillion from September 11th, ranging from the actual day to about a week after, including an OK! magazine. I also figured that when I'm like 70 or someting (if I live that long) my kids / grandkids may be taught about it and I can say 'weel lookie here kiddo'.

       I couldnt care less if "shit happens" was written all over my gravestone because I will be dead and won't know anything about it. The 7 crew members were going in NASA's oldest shuttle and knew their lives were at risk. People die all over the world every day, so what so different about 7 extra people? That is my opinion, I will say nothing more.  I dont read newspapers, whats the point in paying when you have  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/news ?

I cant be bothered to read the Telegraph and papers like that because they are so boring, they only write about very important stuff and dont write about some of the more funny news reports. ok !

       hello, sorry ihavent blogged lately, but im glad you all noticed ! To be honest with you all i reakon the newspapers just print the stroies to get attention, they arnt in it to deliver us news they are in it for money-- How discracefull is that? And to be honest why do they have to print about 12 pages all about how it crashed, why it crashed, when it crashed, who was in it, why they were in it, how their families are coping, pictures of it ( how rude is that) and then not fogeting they then write most of it all over again the next day. I used to read the newspaper every day with out fail but now i tend to read it if there is something good on the front page and then i only read half of the paper cause they write a load of shit in it ! What is the world coming too? Any way sorry bout my rant there just letting off a litlle steam, and id like to say im going naked to the ball ! bye

       I'm sure Jo is fine, didn't she go to see Chicago yesterday with Donna? A highly amusing picture of Andy.  I really can't get over how gay the Daily Star is. Every newspaper I have lokoed at today has the space shuttle on the front weather it be the picture of it breaking up or the crew but its there, theres a story, they are remembering. What does the daily star have? Zoe Ball and Norman Cook. Bloody outrageous and very respectaful. I may write and complian or email the bbc with my view.

       Where is Jo? She is normaly online at this time - hope she's okay. Anything I would say about the space shuttle has been said already, so I won't bother to comment on that.  Today I went shopping! I bought this really massssive scarf which is nearly as tall as me! I bought some underwear, some cosmetics, and had a good smooch around all my favourite shops - didn't buy an aurful lot because I don't have a lot of money at the moment, especily with a holiday coming up soon.  I have been talking to Andy over MSN for the past few minutes, so here is a screenshot of Andy, wearing a pair of breasts:

       Space Shuttle Columbia destroyed, crew of 7 dead. Returning from a 16 day mission. Debris scattrered over Texas.  A terrible tragedy for America and the space program and what does Max say? Shit happens. In that case if you ever die in a car accident or any other way what will be said on you gravestone? Shit happens. That is so inconsiderate. So fucking rude.

       Well I haven't done much at all today. I have been discussing purchasing a domain which I will be doing so once our exams are over. I have been trying to find, which I now have, a padded envelope to send a video to Brazil. I have annoyed someone in America. Oops. I have also, shockingly, tided up my room! dear god what is the world coming to when I tidy my room! Now I must make a start on my IT coursework after I change my 4 calendars over. Lets see, February: Josh Hartnett, Tom Welling, A1, Buffy. WAHOO! Don't forget Taken, 9.00pm, BBC2, Ryan's episode tonight.

       At least you got told the clocks went forward! I didn't know. Andy picking me up to go clay peigon shooting at 9:30am. Right, so if I get up at 8am, that gives me plently of time to eat, have a shower and perhaps make a start on some homework. Did that work? No! I woke up at 9am (8am GMT to what my alarm was set) and I had half an hour to do everything in. Crazyness. Anyway, the clay peigon shooting was brilliant! I did actually shot a fair few, but that shotgun does kickback quite a bit. Spent the rest of my day doing maths coursework, oh how exciting.

You will see white things and parts of buldings and coaches in the background of the photos, and I have taken out the horrible bits.  urlLink Here they are.  All rubbish, but I tried.

       I can (sort of) do line vectors, but that's as far as I can go. You're right, you did say "Donna and I" I miss read, being worn out by my two cousins who are staying with us this weekend. Yesterday we went to Godstone farm, today we went to the park! Ah the joys... That restruant does sound like a good idea - what kind of food is it?

       The meal woz brilliant, the food woz really nice and it definatly filled you up ! Only  thing i was a annoyed about is the bit where Angela's boyfriends Simon walked out cause Darren woz flirting with Angela ! Also we were stuck down the slightly boringer end of the table so we couldnt get in to the convosation as much... After the meal woz good as well cause we managed to get into the Bowling and arcade bit, we had a few goes on the arcade then most people left. Me and Darren couldnt leave until half 11 because that was when the Taxi was booked for, so we wne tinto the bar and ordered some alcoholic drinks ! Somehow we managed to get served even though not one of us looked over 18 !! It was just me, darre, emma, helen, penny left by this time ! We all look the youngest so im really surprised we got served. Unfortuantly it didnt last for long and a bouncer came over and told us to get out of the bar and to leave our drinks becasue we couldnt prove we were over 18 ! We didnt mind though cause we were oging to leave in bout 5 minutes anyway. I think that is the best night out i have ever had, but i suppose thats cause i dont go out very often ! Lol, what a sad life i lead !  Anyway today woz fun !!! NOT i went to croydon with Goff and Darren, David was meant to come but in the end he didnt so it was a bit of a nightmare ! Goff was looking for shoes for the ball which she found but only after 4 hours and it was in a shop we visitied when we first got into Croydon ! Arghhhh. She was quite funny at times though, like when we were going to the bus stop we saw out bus was at the stop bso me and darren started to run to catch it, but Goff said she couldnt run so i said well walk quickly then so she speeded up by  about 2mm per second! Luckily we got the bus cause there were lots of people geting on it so it didnt pull away. What was more funny was when we were actually on the bus it started to move before Goff had sat down and she neally fell over !!!!!!!! I had to grab her hand and pull her to a seat. I nearly wet myself laughing ! And in the entire shopping trip i didnt buy one thing ! Anyway thats enogugh of me for one day so bye bye see ya Monday

Fair enough with the war and all, they need heightened security. I hope this weekend turns out for the best.  Please spare some throughts for the 12 who died in the copter crash and the one american marine who was KIA today and their famillies.

       Hey-ho. Well, hopefully they can avoid using weapons of mass destruction, they barely scraped by with the Cuban Missiles Crisis. Its out of our hands, just hope it gets sorted quickly. And I'm not that worried about war anymore. Well I am, I'm worried for all those soliders out there who could get killed at any moment. You see I figure why worry about it if we can't do anything directly? Its gonna happen, just hope its over with asap. I wouldn't worry too much anyway, the Iraq army would fold under the British and American. I probbaly sound quite 'oh I don;t care' but I do, I do care alot about this situation but there isn't anything I can do!!!!!! I wnat to but there isn't anything.   How are you all?  Very well thanks!  Have you all got your stuff for the ball?  I have my dress but that's it.  And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party?  I'm not going but I hope ya'll have a great time!  And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point ! But maybe thats just me being lazy ! LOL   I totally agree!!!!!!!!!

Just think of hiroshima, all tehm people dies, we are close to london and that is gonna be the main place for an attack? They would get the royals and all the cabinit as well ! Im slightly afraid that if this war goes ahead then we are gonna alll die and painfully as well ! Not to make you all feel bad but im just slightly worried ! LOL Well anywho we better live our lives to the full now cause we mite not be aound for much longer With Love jackie ! x x x x x x Anywho Back to more exciting matters ? How are you all? Have you all got your stuff for the ball ? And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party? I sure am cause its gonna be fun dont ya think ? And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point !

       Finaly! I'm on a computer, wow. Spent most of my evening staring at my music coursework hopeing that a melody will pop out from somewhere and write its self onto a page - no such luck so far.  What a day hey? Robin Cook (British Cabinet minister and Leader of the House of Commons) resigns, UN staff at the Kuwait-Iraq border move out along with all UN staff inside Iraq. Russia and Portugal tell their staff to leave Iraq while diplomatic staff from other countries begin to leave the country. George W. Bush is going to issue a speach tonight where he will make a final ultimatum to Saddam. We are going to war. Now I ain't gonna go on about this for ages, but I am starting to be pro-war. If we stop now, he's just going to come after us in future years and probably cause a lot of damage. The people in Iraq are in great trouble and need help, what can we do? Sit around and wait to get blown up or gased, or actually stop him before he gets rid of us. Just the ice-cream talking probably, but still.  Now this is pathetic,  urlLink Dogbreath ad is withdrawn , "A TV advertisement featuring a man "vomiting" up a live dog has been pulled after record complaints from viewers ... chewing gum manufacturer Wrigley's decided to withdraw the advertisement, for its X-cite brand of gum, after watchdog Independent Television Commission (ITC) received more than 700 complaints ... 'Parents have been complaining that their children are scared by it, and some of the adults have said they were actually sick themselves after watching it'." I'm sorry, but that is pathetic, that advert is not disgusting or horrible, you barely even see anything at all apart from a dog jumping out of somebodies mouth. It isn't sick, and it's a fairly amusing advert. It didn't make me laugh, but at least it isn't as dull as Persil or a debt helper.  Anyway, this  urlLink Steve Bell cartoon  sort of sums up todays events to a certain extent. G'night.

       Jo you little f**k. What the f**k have you been f**king smoking or you just f**king high on f**king fear? You f**k.  Yes, sorry, problems with blogger this morning. All sorted now. Yes, yesterday. Ah, yesterday. Fond memories. An educated hour or so wandering around art galleries, taking in some culture. Especially that of the Tudors whose paintings all look the same. Then a five minute brisk walk through a rather pathetic peace protest. Well, they did try. And we were attacked by a few pigeons and we all now what pigeons mean. Then a wonderfull 2 and half hours of Freddie and Chris. Feel free to take Freddie Jo, Chris is mine. Hehe. I think his hair suited his character. Maybe it will be cut now they have finished the play. Or maybe his next film requires long hair. Who knows. Who knows why Mary owned a little lamb. Who knows.

       Bad moment today. We assembled the PC, and discovered we had incompatible memory. I knew this all along, but my dad didnt want to change the memory for the compatible modules. So he's suffering now. Tomorrow, my dad is going to go all the way to London, because he ignored me, and just to buy a floppy drive and replace the memory modules. (We didnt want a floppy drive at first because we have no use for it, but I need it for schoolwork).

       As long as I can maintain my B grade, I will be happy.  Coombes didn't ask for my geography coursework! Yay. I got a C in a geography test we done the other day. Not too bad, considering I didnt revise (again).

       I did my history homework last night at about 11:30pm, just slipped my mind... You didn't revise? That was silly, I revised loads, did as many practice papers as possible. I think it paid off :)

       I got my business studies test results as well, mine being:  Unit A - How Businesses Operate - 23/35 (Merit)  Unit B - How Businesses Develop - 20/35 (Pass) ONLY ONE OFF A BLOODY MERIT! GRRR  Unit C - Business Finance - 25/35 (Merit)  So that wasnt too bad at all, considering I didnt revise for any of them. (Shhh, dont tell Dilley!)  My coursework for that is currently averaging out now to a BB grade. I could get an A*A grade if I put max effort in. I have six weeks :)    SHIT!!!!! AAAAAAAAA Just remembered, Gallaghers homework! bugger it. quarter to ten, erm, ok, plan of action.....have pot noodle, have shower, then do the work in bed. That sounds about right.

       I usualy watch MTV Dance, and quite often there is something interesting on MTV2, MTV Base just sucks and gives me a headache. But MTV for Jackass, a always.  I haven't blogged for ages, don't know why.  My business studies results are as follows... Unit 1 = 29/35 (distinction) Unit 2 = 35/35 (distinction) Unit 3 = 29/35 (distinction) Distinction is the equiverlent to a A/A*, all I have to do now is get me coursework up to distinction level and I will have my A/A*!  Unfortunatly my photos of New York didn't go very well because the film I used was the film my brother used when he went to Germany and he didn't rewind it properley. So I only managed to get 2/25 photos.  urlLink Times Square  and  urlLink a building a couple of blocks away from Times Square . I did have another film which is being processed now, but I can't remember what's on it, I think a photo of the Statue of Liberty's bum (that's all we could see the weather was so bad) and a park.  I have had my teeth operation explained to me. I am quite impressed with my teeth, I have a severe class three case on the top and bottom of the mouth, what ever the means, but it don't sound pretty does it? The whole process takes 2 years from start to finish. Braces for 1 year to align my teeth up straight, and then 2 days in hospital after an operation to move my jaw into the correct place, then back to braces for 6 months to finish is off, then to retainers for however long is needed (normaly 2-3 months). So that sounds like fun, I won't be able to speak for two days! How will I ever cope? Which brings me nicely onto my next point...  ...tomorrow Christy is doing a Sponsered Silence! So I am going to walk up to her and ask her a few questions which she can only respond to by saying "yes" or nothing at all. Mwhahahahhah power.

       HA! I have proof now taht shcool really is bad for your health. I have become slightly ill and the reason why? Instead of going home at the normal 3.35 I don't leave school until 5! Why? Because I stay for art, science, german, textiles and IT. Now i'm all run down and erugh :( And now the Inspectar Calls trip has been canceled I'm very annoyed. Well, at least we get our money back.  So what have I got to look forward to atm? My great friends on message boards I talk to who are teh most lovely people in the world! I am looking forward to Saturday Jo! Woooooooo! (BTW, if you can get dropped at my house at 10.15am or so then my dad can run us both straight up the train station). And I am emailing some people who have seen it so that we may have a chance of meeting Chris and Freddie! Wooooooooo!  What programs do you watch on MTV if you get it? I watch Jackass and MTV Cribbs. Love Cribbs. I was watching O-town!!!!!!!!!! really nice house!

       Curently i am also happy because i got my business studies results back. They are : Unit 1 = 27 (merit) Unit 2 = 29 (distinction) Unit 3 = 25 (merit) I am pretty  happy with that but that unit 1 was a bit annoying because i was 1 mark away from getting a distintion !  Overall i think i will get a B maybe if i try harder i can geet an A ! Yippee. Neway thats all i wanted to say LOL Toodles-  Jackie

My deadline for tech.........................31st March. I think I can make that one. My deadline for I.T...........................Easter. Quite a lot of it to do, but its easy.

All we need is a hard drive which should arrive in about 3 or 4 days. Byebye.

       I've decided to re-change my A-level options. Originally, in a perfect world, I wanted to do I.T, Electronics and AVCE Business. But no.... Vinton said I cant do electronics because I am not taking physics. Crap. So instead I chose to do Media Studies instead of Electronics. Now, as I have seen the application form again, I just want to do I.T and AVCE Business. Media Studies will probably not play any part in my life, so there is no point in doing it as it will be in theory 25% more extra work for sod all in return. P.S: I managed to recover 50 pages of Business coursework out of the 75. The other "lost" 25 pages I found in draft form on the schools network. Not bad. I'm getting happier.....slowly.

       Ugh, this week has been so crap. I wont go into detail because there is so much rubbish that I will type. The main reasons are: Nic.J is ill with the flu :( I hope she gets better soon! Tonsa coursework Plus losing around 75 pages of business studies coursework is icing on the cake. I sure damn hope my beloved MS-DOS program can restore the floppy disk, its done 100 times better than all 6 of my Windows data recovery programs! Oh well.

       I was talking to Blackburn the other day and he asked me what changed, why we are going home, and I said nothing. That's not true ya know, I think every things changed. I know I changed. Ya know a friend of mine asked me before I got here, when we were all shipping out, he asked me why are you going to fight somebody else's war? What, do ya all think your all heroes? I didn't know what to say at the time, but if he asked me again I'd say no. I'd say there's no way in hell. Nobody asks to be a hero, just sometimes turn out that way. It's not that i like em or i don't like em- I respect them. Look, these people have no jobs, no food, no education, and no future. i just figure that, ya know, I mean we have two things we can do. We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN. Right? Sometimes people ask me why I do it, they say what are you some sort of a war junky? I dont answer them cuz they will never understand. understand that its just for the man fight next to you. Only the dead live to see the end of the war.

       Any pictures are great guys, we can slot them into the categories or into Misc. We will put them on the site and see how they go, if people really don't like them we will have to take them off but we'll see how it goes. Thanks :)  My weekends plans are simply doing homework and recooperating from Thursday. London is really tiring. Today I did lots of art and watched Black Hawk Down. YES! JOSH HARTNETT IS IN A WAR FILM AND ACTUALLY LIVES FOR ONCE!!!!!! WOOOO!!!!! Yea, so that made me happy but now I am all very patriotic towards the USA. BHD is a true story film and they're motto type o thing: 'Leave no man behind'. Even if they guys were dead they defended them and kept the bodies safe until they could get them out of there. Now that, is honour.

The weather in NY wasn't good, so the photos I took probably won't come out too well, but I tried. I was going to make more recordings, but I only made one for some reason.  urlLink This is the group on the bus just after we landed.

I had an ok day today although there is one thing which is annoying me. And that is the fact that everyone keeps slagging off Mr G. Ok so he may not conduct the best lessons with his sarcastic comments and stuff but he is a good teacher and if it were between him or Mr M, Mr G would probably get us a better grade in the exam.

       Hello? Anyone out there?  Well I did not have any clue what was going on in our science lesson. To me it was a board of waffle and I sat there feeling like a total plum. So in the case of me being a plum, here is the song from Joey in frineds: "this hand is your hand, this hand is my hand, is that hand your hand? no wait thats my hand!" although in my case perhaps it should be more along the lines of is that brain your brain?

       Well today woz ok i suppose escept for the fact that i stayed behind after schoolfor 2 hours doing bloody IT coursework and im doing that again tmor. So help me GOD ! Once again i didnt do one thing in science i didnt even bother to unpack my bag, what joyus fun. I think Mr moore needs to get some control over the class. He never seems to teach us anything becuase he gets sidetracked and ends up chatting to a group of people in the corner dont ya think ? Everybody is getting well excited about leaving, we still have most of next week yet! I cant believe people are already bringing in cameras and stuff. Fair enough people bringing in the boooks for people to write in becuase it takes time to do that. Everybody is just going hyper and it is making me feel left out ! I am already fed up of school and i cant seem to get myself motivated i still have my french homework to do but i cant be bothered so that will be done on the thursday, which in fact is very stupid because there is loads to do ! Ahhhhhhhhh Just to  let you know Mr Moore is the sexiest teacher in the school other than Miss Kay of course ! Well im now off for my dinner cause i am starving and i need some nutrician (soz bout spelling) toodles

       Well I didn't have such an interesting day, infact I didn't really have anything interesting in my day. At all. I did quite a bit of work, doing everything I should have done over the last two weeks. I went for a swim, that's quite exciting, lots of water and stuff. So other than all that, everything is a bit alsage.

       No more days left, lol. Went to the Europa Centre today, have to say that although the journey was deadful and Ms Slark really irritated me, the centre was actually ok. Mainly because the people told me I speak good french. But it was okay. I booked a 2 week holiday to Austria to go skiing, and then Jackie and I are sharing a caravan tomorrow night, for 2 nights. What fun. I also bought some shampoo which cost me 18 (rip off!), and some coffee and cheese. Oh, and a hat. Jackie purchased the lovliest pink bag, have to say that it suited her so well! Ha ha. But the journey was awful. Hours of the tube (about 26 stops I think, on the smelly district line). Then it was raining, and the teachers didn't know whre we were going- they had to stop and ask for directions!! Then on the way back Ms Slark said we all had to  get off the train at East Croydon, even though the train we were on would have taken us straight home, and if we got off the train we'd just be getting striahgt back on it. But no, we have to get off. So after a lot of arguing I was quite cross. But then right at the last minute the 3 of us who wanted to get the East Grinstead train just announced that was what we were going to do and legged it before she could say much! But it would have been really stpuid otherwise, and probably ad ded about 30 minutes onto our journey. Bloody hopeless teachers. Anyway! What's everyone else been up to today?

       What would we do without the internet?  Yes, thank you Max for organising all that, jolly good fun - I would love to go again, perhaps in the summer guys?

       Good Good. I had a marvellous day, I really enjoyed it, and I was so chuffed that i didn't fall over! Okay, a few near misses, but at least I'm still in one piece (except for the blisters on my ankles!). I really enjoyed myself, haven't had a good bit of fun in a long time! It proibably won't be that lo ng before I go back, Nancy reckons I'm taking her next weekend, ha ha! No. Maybe later in the summer. Anyway, thanks to max for organising it, and thanks to everyone else for making it such an enjoyable day!  Tomorrow is the Europe centre, which will probably be as boring as hell. Providing that I can actually walk to get there, lol. But you don't know, miracles may happen! Anyway, see ya later guys, I'm off to get some beans on toast!

I've only ever been once before, so I'm begging people, please don't dessert me tomorrow!" I'll probably spend most of the day flat on my back, but hey! It's all fun really. I#'ve even bought a little disposable camera to capture everyone making prats of themselves, he he! Anyway! Nicki, that song is probably by Good Charlotte? If not, I'm guessing that's it's Drops of Jupiter, by Train? But it's probably the first one! lol. Anyway, busy day at work today, insane people wanteing to buy the most bizarro things meant I was up and down a ladder all day. Anyway, too knackered to talk and my fingers are all bleeding, I must go and bandage them up, till tomorrow peoples!

Tell me did you sail across the sun, Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded, And that heaven is overrated, Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star, One without a permanent scar, And did you miss me while you were looking at yourself out there.

       Well. Today i got up. Ate. Got dresssed. Rummaged through the bomb site (formerly known as my room) and tried to find my english book. Attempted the end half of and essay. Got bored because it was so dull and dreary. Gave up. Had a piece of toast for lunhc at 11am. Played midtown madness for 45 minutes. Walked to the village to go to work. Worked in shop for 4 and a half hours. Encountered some veyr strange people. Packed up. walked home. Played midtown madness until dinner. Tried to make CD work- it won't. Currently sitting here. Wondering what to do. It's rainging. Yuck. Might come back later. Might not.

       Very nice! Even though, for some bizarro reason, none of the pictures can be found by Yahoo. Stupid server. Anyway! Today I went to Croydon again wit my sisters, they were both bargain hutning. Nancy got a pair of those rave trousers (with the tassley bits and stuff all down them, strings and whot not, lol!) and they are blue, Louise bought a couple of tops I think? I really can't rememebr! We were in Alders hours and she tried on about 10 different things, but bought nothing! What a waste of time, lol. Seeings as I've got nothing planned now until Monday, revision starts tommorrow. Anyone who reads this blog regularly will notice that I've said that every day, but this time I really mean it :(  I'm off, see you later guys.

       I got bored so I did this:  We were supposed to leave the school on our double decker coach at 04.30PM.  urlLink Jack  urlLink ie  came up to say hi. I think  urlLink Darren  did, I'm not sure. Didn't leave until about 07.00PM. Why? Well the coach was late. Then they had to keep repacking the luggage bit because there wasn't enough room. Plus there was a big ol crack in the front of the upper section which they thought was dangerous. Because of the late start we missed about 3 ferrys to France. Eventually we got on one at about 10.30PM. While waiting to get booked on this ferry we had great fun at the front of the coach taking  urlLink pictures ! And generally being hyper. The coach trips there and back were probably the best bit of the trip!  urlLink Madness ! To get to our designated (love that word) hotel we had to pass through France,  urlLink Switzerland  and Italy. Long trip but fun. The hotel was cool, had to  urlLink get up  each morning at 7am! There were many o amusing moments throughout the week. In Verona  urlLink Jane  ate a Kinder egg. The toy was this Virgin Mary staute so we built it and put it at the front of the coach. About a minute later a nun crossed the road!!!!!  We even brought some football shirts and made our own  urlLink team ! If ever to go to Venice make sure you get a ride on the  urlLink gondalas . Take an art book! Do some  urlLink sketching ! Ever met  urlLink Peggy ? Of course we were  urlLink cream-crackered  on the way home. Maybe that was because were up  urlLink late .... But whenever you go on a group holiday, always take a  urlLink group photo .

       I saw Tom in Croydon! It was really scary, i was talking to my friend about e-mailing people and I was saying "I e-mail Tom alot cos he's always there", look up and who's walking towards us, but Tom? It was REALLY scary! Anyway. I bought a CD today but it's for Lisa's birthday so I shouldn't really post here what it is just in case someone accidently lets slip, lol! What else did I get? Oh yeah, a beanie baby Babboon as a late easter pressent for my sister, cos she was moaning abut me not getting her one, and it was cheap, lol. Cheap-skate me. Other than that I got a little book too! For all you lot to write it, ha ha!

              I bought this album today in Croydon. It's really good, tell you more when I've finished listening to it! Good film, Johnny English, kept a smile on my face for the whole time, very good. Atkinson as good as ever, I don't think I've seen him in a new film or movie for ages? I also bought a little book for all you guys to write in on the last day of term - getting excited now, year 11s almost over! Nothing going on much in my life really. This looks quite interesting, somebody is going to turn the whole Who Wants To Be A Millionaire thing with the cheater into a movie  urlLink Millionaire scam to become film  - should be interesting.

       Lol. Tom, did you know that Julz's oboe teacher is Pete Long's girlfriend/wife (can't remember which)? Pete Long being a member of Jool's Rhythm & Blues Orchestra? She is going to have a sneaky word with her and see what she can arrange, but nothing promised though, but wouldn't that be cool?!! I cannot wait! Seems like everyone has got Jools fever at the moment!  I can't wait for Bon Jovi either- that will probably be the best gig that I've ever been too, although we will probably get deafened!! Yahooooooo!  In the end I didn't see the 300th episode of the Simpsons last night, I went to bed and watched the film about Anne Frank, which was qutie interesting. I might try to read it again, I  think. I read a lot of it when I was in year 4, but it was a bit advanced for me then and I didn't really understand all of it, and eventually my teacher told me to give up and read something more normal (teachers for you, eh?!). But I might get it out the library and read it after the exams of something, seeings as I will probably have a lot of spare time on my hands! Anyway. I've just come back from clearing up the kitchen, I went down there annd there was dozens of bowls, plates and glasses on the side, so I opened the dishwasher and found it was full of dirty plates (or so i thought). So, I washed and dried up all this stuff, took me over half an hour to do, only for Nancy to walk in and say "What are you doing that for? The dishwasher is clean, y ou've just got to empty it" and I thought some very rude things then! i was also quite cross cos I'd squeezed a couple of plates, a glass and quite a bit of cutlery into the dishwasher, so I had to try and decide which was clean and which wasn't! Worst thing was, I was about to run the dishwasher cos I'd filled it up with the powder and eveyrhting, so I would have been re-washing most of it! Geez I am so thick sometimes! After all that I have decided not to do any revision this morning seeings as it is nearly lunch anyway, I will just mess around playing computer games, and after lunhc I will do some serious revision! (says she who has said that eveyr day yet done none properly yet). Anyway, toooodle-oooo guys.

       When I went to see Jools Holland in the Royal Albert Hall they where 45 minutes late, so the crowd decided to start a mexican wave. The only problem is the Royal Albert Hall has circular seating going to whole way round the building so the wave didn't stop until the music started, just kept going on, and on, and on. The best bit was when a group of people tried to start another one going in the other direction, it lasted for a little while until the two met and it fell apart a bit.

My job is at a little DIY come homecare shop in Warlingham, I have been there for three weeks now and I'm enjoying it! Anywya, can't really type veyr well cos I've just burnt my middle finger on the sandwich toaster and it's gone all funny already, I will probably end up with a blister which is not going to be fun on the pad of my finger! Anyway, I really ought to do some revision today, so I'd better go before the Simpsons at 9.30! Bye guys

       Just got back from a few days up in Manchester. I went with mother to see Ronan Keating at the MEN Arena. It holds 18,000 and looks small but you don't realise at first that there is a second tier up above you! It was a good laugh. The stewards were trying to get a Mexican wave going, eventually they did and it was so fun. The concert itself was better than at Wembley. Maybe it was because he had some more dates under his belt I'm not sure. Maybe it was because there were more people? And that the audience was younger? But it was good. Veyr good atmosphere, everyone was up for it and jumping about. When he came on at the back of teh arena for the encore 'Pump It Up' and the whole audeinece was clapping and stuff I could just picture this track being shown somewhere like the Hard Rock Cafe. What is your job Jo? Max please blog. That is a request. A couple more and sposh, you'll be gone.

       lol, it was quite funny. Dad kepy piping in about burying giblets under the patio, for some reason. Nancy was throwing up in the lounge cos she is really ill, she has been up since 3am crying, she is so hot you could fry eggs on her, and she has been sick numerous times. Also she is being very "mummyfied" today, and won't be in a room without mum, so when we were eating lunch she was sprawled on the sofa. Which wasn't a good idea, seeings as she could see and smell the food.

       Really? Cool. I've just had my yummy lunch! Roast Turkey with bread sauce and lots of roastie potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, and gravy! And to finish it off yummy mini eggs! we had a really weird discussion though, we were tlaking about digging the patio up, and thne mum started saying she doesn't know why people bother to bury bodies under the patio cos it's so much work, then we started talking about how you do it etc etc. Then it emerged that Louise had gone to get a cloth out the sink, but she reached into the sink and grabbed the turkey giblets! OOooh it was funny! All this while poor Nancy is throwing up in the lounge. Marvellous, I love Easter.

       It is next Monday he comes home, or perhaps even Tuesday. I'm not sure, but I am quite positive it is one of those two days! Brad Pitt's bottom sounds like a very good piece of artwork, anyone fancy a trip to Madame Tussauds sometime soon........................??! Anyway! I've been at work all day and my knees and feet are killing me, but I really enjoy it cos it is so interesting and I'm active all day! Beats sitting on my butt watching the tv or whatever! Anyway, she has decided she needs some extra help next week, so I'm working Friday as well as Saturday, and possibly even Wednesday and Thursday! So extra money coming my way this week, lol! Its quite nice though cos Tina (who works there) likes to gossip, and sometimes when its quite we just chat about stuff! She's always asking my what I'm doing tonight (as in Saturday night) and it's quite sad cos I always have to say "staying home and watching tv"!!! At least at the mo I have the excuse that I'm too busy revising for my exams, lol. But she was quite interested to hear about the BonJovi concert that I've got lined up! Weather is horrible today, it's been threatening to rain all day, and even when it wasn't drizzling it was soooo windy! half the pots outside the shop decided to blow away, so one of my duties today was chading them all down the road! One of the wheelie bins also decided to go for a roll which was quite annoying, it wouldn;'t stay still! In the end I tied it to one of the metal bins. I really shoudl shut up now because you lot probably really don't want to hear about my dustbins and whotnot but hey! My faminly aren't in a listening mood cos they've been digging up the patio all day and are now comatosed on the sofa, so I thought I'd come and blog to get everything out of my system! That's the problem with not talking for a lot of the day- you have to let it all out eventually! Anyway, I really will leave you in peace now, have fun tomorrow guys and don't eat too much chocolate! We've got a novel new experiment going on in our house- no chocolate of any sort for easter. Whoppee. But I guess I'll be thankful in the long run! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

       It's either this Sunday or next Sunday. Just catching up on the news and I have found that Madame Tussaud's waxworks are not made of wax! Only the head and hands are, the rest is fibre glass. Only one exception which is brand new this week, Brad Pitt's bottom, which is made from a foam and silicon mixture to make it squeezably lifelike.

       Well so far this holiday i have not revised one iota ! Really i need some little person at my side to come up to me and go : Rivise you little scoundle u, or i will rip your head off and flush it down the loo! I think that way i would sit down and do some revision. But my problem is i find it so god damn boring! Id rather sit outside and burn my eyes out than revise !  The reason i dont come on during the day is because it costs a bomb if you dont have broadband, which idont have so therefore it means i cant come on during the day. I have only just realside that because it is a bank holiday today i could have come on earlier because it is cheap! But neva mind at least i am on half an hour earlier than usual.  I went down the park today with a couple of friends but it woz sooooooooo boring that we ended up coming back early ( i mean like we were down the park for less than an hour ) That dobbins hill really does your legs in even if you are used to going up it ! I think in toal i stopped like 20 times because i got knackered after going up like 3 steps. Nicki isnt coming on here today or tonight because she is up in Manchester i think and is seeing another Ronan concert with her mutter. Tom is on holiday in the Lake districk (I think) with Andy Pandy. Max is with his lovely girlfriend Nic at this moment in time so is probably too busy to deal with blogging! LOL ( they make a really good couple ) I have nothing else planned for the holidays although i want to go and see Jhonny English, hopefully dat will happen and i also have that Europa trip to look forward to on the extra day we have off. Oh what joys, I am begining to think it was a bad idea becuase you dont get to choose who you go with in a group, you just get shoved in a group as you go through "Customs". Which means i could end up with David Andrews or even Joanna. Ahhhhhhhh. Only kidding Jo ! I am dreading the french speaking cause i cant even understand what the teacher goes on about in english let alone what she is saying in french ! But hopefully i will get half decent grades in the other bits to give me a decent grade overall. You must be bored by reading this by now so i will leave you to blog for yourself or to ignore everything i have just writen ! hehe bye

       Where is everybody?!!! Is everybody revising? But surely you can't revise all day, everyday, and every night? Get a life peeps! Okay, I admit, I have been nrevising a lot, but I am still fiding time to pop in here and blog, to let whoever bothers to read the blog know what's going on in our little world!  Well, today it is still sunny but there is quite a strong wind, therefore it is nowhere near as hot as yesterday. However, sitting in a south-facing room with all the w indows shut, I am sweltering. Mother and Father are destroying the patio (it has one end missing now and a big hole in the middle) with sledge hammers, apparently it has sunk and they need to re-set it? Well, I haven't a clue what they're doing but they've just discovered it is built on mud (ha ha, yet another botch job from the builders!), and dad has got all of next week off to do it. Except he is going to a motorbike show on Monday. Louise is lying in the hammock (very suave) wearing a suntop, sunglasses and a towwl (not quite sure what happened to the rest of her clothes), and reading Harry Potter 4. Nancy is at the bottom of the garden wearing a pair of polythene gloves (??) And playing with a friend's guinea pigs that we are looking after while they are away in the Peak District. I suppose I sholudb't complain that they're down the garden, earlier Louise marched in and demanded that I held one of the pigs whilst she made a cup of tea. Animals are fair enough, but when you have to hold them for long periiods of time you begin to wonder how strong their bladders are. But I guess guinea pigs' bladders are stronger than my little cousin Matthew's (aged 2 1/2, visited yesterday), as sometime yesterday afternoon he managed to wee down Louise's top. That's a bit worrying, cos I've just realised that Louise is wearing the top again today and there was no wash load done last night..................... At the moment I'm in the middle of writing out ALL my geography case studies onto little cue cards, so I can play snap like games! Yay! I have done 3 out of 6 of my French aural topics, so I'm gradually getting there, I just need to go through them all and get mother to tell me how to pronounce half the words, lol! When I've finished the geography case studies I think I will go on and do some more on the Cold War, as I need to brush up on the space race and the arms race. It's always the things that you haven't revised properly that come up on the damned exams, so I'm gonna try and make sure i know everyhting inside-ou by the time we get to the exams! I have a month till the first exam (Music and RE on the first day), and then another week before any more exams (thank god for half terms!!). So really I'm stressing about things that aren't really gonna be that big a problem (I sincerely hope!). I just need a bit more sself-discipline, so I can work for 2 hours instead of giving up after and hour and then playing 30 minutes on this fab game called 'Super Bounce Out'. Oh the joys. Please blog guys (do I sound like Nicki?!!!) cos I am as bored as hell, haven't spoke to any of my friends for ages, and I'll go insane if there's nothign to do apart from play with various virtual multi-coloured rubber bouncy balls. Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee guys.

       Well, I'm here, well for the moment anyway. Yes i have been sunning myself although it woz a bit to windy to do it today. I have been to the cinema with Nicki today to see: Blue Crush. It was actually better than expected, i thought it was gonna be a really boring film but it wasnt ! I have already got myself a tan, but i can always improve it and it will be better if i have a tan b4 i go to majorca cause that way i will come back looking fine! (hopefully with some boys numbers) Hehe In fact i cant wait for my holiday, which is not that long away now ! Woooohooooo But first i have the boring task of revising for my GCSE's and then the task of actually doing them. eek well enough of my boring chit chat ill be off now to leave u in some peace.

       Me again. It's 11am and I've done 30 m,inutes revision on teh Cold War, it's suprising how much I can remember, having already revised it thoroughly twise (for yr 10 exmas and mocks) so I don't actually have veyr much to worry about it! On to Germany next I thinks! Anyway, weather is beautiful again, but I am hiding in my room all day today because my aunt is coming (which is always a complicated procedure). She always phones up and invites her and her 2 boys (both under 5) round, they make a fowl mess, she talks absolute rubbish, mum doesn't like her, and they never leave (plus they always arrive at least an hour early, and frequently phone up at 8,30 when we're all still aslepp). Fun. Mum has told her today that I'm revising all day (I really don't feel like seeing them), therefore I'm staying in my room all day, I don't think I'll even venture down for lunch! Much safer to stay up here when she's around. So, back to history I guess, thought I'd just pop in here for a bit while I give my eyes a break! Acutlaly, beeter go and get some drink supplies if I'm hibernating all day. Later peeeeeps.

       IYo peeps. I have been having such a busy week I haven't had much time for revision yet, alrthough I have done bits and bobs that I needed to sort! Proper revision starts tomorrow though, when my sis has no more hordes of friends round (thank god!). But, at least we have glorious weather! Mum and I sat out in the garden this afternoon, we are both as white as sheets so we have decivede that we needed to tan! Unfortunatley I'm still as white as when I started, but hey, I'mm looking after my skin and I 'm not gonna look 40 when I'm 20 (me hopes!!). Anyway, gotta go, people to go, places to see.......bye!

       I'm here. Have been here all weekend, apart from yesterday when I was working from 9 till 5, and when I got home I was knackered so I ate dinner and then watched Harry Potter that someone had bought yesterday. Today my uncle came round as it was Lou's birthday, and among all the nice pressies she got 2 dance mats and the Ps game, so we have been on that all afternoon, and I mean since about 2.30! It's now 5 and I've only just given uip, ha ha! Tomorrow I'm going to France for the day with a firned so I probably own't blog as I will be back late, and when I do get back I will try and fit some revision in! That is what I'm going to do now- revision. After a second helping of that triple-chocolate-truffle-900calories a slice-Thornton's-cake..........................

       Ah yes! I was wondering where Tom was, and I've just remembered that he has gone to Thorpe Park too, so I'm all alone, :( No worries though, I've had a lazy morning! Got up about 9.45 having been woken up by Nancy shouting "Bye Jo!" about 3 million times before she went out to school, and got woken up by Louise charging around like a looney in order to get a 7.50am train- crAzy!!! So, I got up, leisurely got dressed, did some washing (aren't I helpful?), read a magazine, had a veyr long phone call to my friend Sarah, ate lunch, now I'm here! What fun. It's flippin' cold outside, hope you guys haven't frozen to death yet, cos that wouldn't be very good.  I've got everyhting sorted out for the ball now, and I'm sooooooooooo excited! My hair is gonna be so cool (even if I say so myself!), and I think I'm gonna look quite different, he he! I'm also going to pick up my dress this afternoon, so everthing will be perfect! Yay! My friend had her ball last night (Riddlesdown) and she said the limo was fab, they were all hanging out the windows and waving at anyone possible, so that's something we've gotta try guys! I think it's gonna be brilliant! Who si eveyrone having their photos taken with? Or are you lot having them done on your own? Sarah said they managed to get about 7 people in theirs, I'm looking forward to seeing it to see what it turns out like, ha ha! Generally she had a fab time, but I think ours is gonna be HUGE! Really posh place, nice food, good music, all our friends, having one heck of a time!  Right, I reallly shoiuld go and do some work now. I'm going to start by copying up Nicki's history, so I can either post it through her door tonight, or it will perhaps be Sunday? I don't know, gimmie a yell if you need it before then Nicki! Tooooooooodle pip guys. Don't really know why I'm saying that, seeings as none of you are here, but hey. Tooooooooooooodles pips.

I am going to be wiped out by the end of the day ! anyway ill be off now i may as well start getting my stuff ready, that way i will have more time to do stuff in the morning ! HeHe see ya all tmor !

       My nose hurts. And I have just discovered I have an infection in my eaar (as in actually inside my ear lobe)- it was really hurting so I was rubbing it, and discovered this big lump inside my ear lobe. Mother says it is not normal, and I htink it is because I am allergic to alot of my earings. I have just thrown most of my earings in the bin. But how my ear hurts- Nicki I totally sympathesise with you.

       I was in a good mood earlier anyways because  1) I'm going to Thorpe Park  2) American forces are in Baghdad and Brittish have now taken Basra. Its great!!! Now I'm not because of the dumbass lot round the other conrer who decided to push down our human pyramid. You have no idea how much my head hurts now. I really hate Marc, JFK and Flandrews right now and I will gold this as a long term grudge.

Even the set 5's of our year know that the summer exam is going ot be on everyhting we've done this year! Geeeez, he irritated me today. We've been doign forces to death when we coudl have been revising more useful things, like the stuff no-one gets in waves and radiation. Flippin' heck, dudes.

       I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel. Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you. I was dreaming while I drove, the long straight ahead. To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. Is that all right? I drove all night.  What in this world keeps us from tearing apart? No matter where I go I hear the beating of your heart. I think about you when the night is cold and dark. No-one can move me the way that you do, nothing erases this feeling between me and you.  I drove all night, to get to you, is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. I drove all night, is that all right? I drove all night.  To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. Is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room, woke you from your sleep to make love to you.  I drove all night. To taste your sweet kisses you arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night.   Honey love love, ooh it'd ease my mind. I need to find time, someone to call mine. My mamma said you can't hurry  love, no you';ll just have to wait. She said 'love don't come easy, its a game of give-and-take'.  urgh this one is way too fast for me. Never mind.

I think it was only a few piccies that I wrote down when I was at ur house before science revision with Jane. Don't feel down, the sun is out, the birds are singing, and it's nearly all over!  Anyway I've got to go as I am going to Goff's party, hope I am not the only one there !!!

       What lovely weather today. I went to Andys breifly today because he needed to give me the money for the photos. I got to see the pups. They are so lovely. Helen was with me because he needed to give her a birthday present. I got to pick em up and stuff. Holly is lovely, she is so sweet. She kept coming in now an dthen tocheck on them and when they started whining she came in. Bless. You can see their personalities already, the lazy one, the attention seeker, the bully...lol. I'm feeling really down though at the moment. Everything is just so, pants.  I have found that every year my hayfever is different. This year my brain feels like it is wrapped up in cotton wool.

       What do you do if you think a friend needs help? Like serious help, not just that she's struggling at school or something. What do you do? What if this friend pushes away all the time, won't let anyone in? What if she won't speak to you, won't tell you anything, yet you thought you were her trusted best friend, just as you trusted her? What if she's changed so much you just don't know who she is, you don't understand her? But what do you do if you think this could turn out very badly for her? As in she might do something very stupid, but you can't talk to her, nor her family about it?   What do you do??????

       Well, what an interesting day. At least it is hot now, and I've been doing maths and history i the garden all day, now I am a bit roasty, but hey! Our phone line is dead, no-one can call us, and when pick up the phone you just hear nothing, not even the dialing tone. And it would be on a day that I need to call loads of people to sort stuff out! Plus my phone battery just died. And I discovered I only had 3p credit so I had to go out and buy some more. The umbrella shading me from the scorching sun in the garden keeps falling over. And then to top it all, a bird flies over and craps on my history book. Oh the jiys of living in the Great British countryside.  Hope whoever went to the cinema had fun, that film sounded good at first but then the trailers looked a bit silly, and hope people who went to the fair didn't get too burnt, and didn't spend all their hard-earned money!!

       Hey guys! I've just got back from Legoland, and boy did I have fun!! Firstly I got in free (saved me 19) and then the first ride I went on, I got so wet I had to walk round wearing wet underwear all day!! all in all it was a great day, I won't bore you all with the details right now!

       I had a fun day today. I went shopping with Pennie and got a new top and earrings. We had a nice pizza hut buffet lunch which was nice. On my way out I saw Angela so I spoke with her for a bit. Her and Simon are so sweet. Speaking of Simons, Jackie......in fact I will pester you on msn now.

       Aww, poor Jackie. Sometimes it does that to me when I am on msn, if teh connect cuts out for a second you are signed out and I never realise so I start to wonder why no one is talking and they realise I have been offline for about ten minutes. Which can be crucial. I didn't know Tom was leaving and this may be late to Tom but: Have a good time! I was forced into science revision earlier. I have done all the enviroment topic now. Bet I won't remember it but I tried. I can't handle the history. Its way too hard. I may go and find Mr Weston after half term to ask for any revision tips for history. I am drinking the most disgusting drink. Lilt. Yuk! I am only drinking it because its fizzy. I am meeting up with Pennie tomorrow to do our Sk8er Boi stalking and then to buy a new top for Friday. It should be a laugh.

       lol okay bey bye Jackie! I htink Tom has gone to Greece sailing, although I ahd totally forgotten that he was going on holiday, i had just heard him mentioning it! But I think that must be where he has gone. Um, nice weather today, sat in the garden and did some revision for about 3 hours, the most I've done yet!! Weather was nice but now it's come over a bit cloudy, hence me being on the PC now! Got to go and pick Nancy up from Guide camp later, so the peace in our house will be broken! aww!  I'm off cos I'm eternally bored. Bye bye!

       Oh Bollox, just great. I write a nice long blog press post and publish and then reaslise that my connection to the internet had stopped and i have lost everything i wrote in there. FUCK ( scuse the language) Well Tom has gone to a hot country, but unfortuantly i cant remeber which one. I actually asked tom to write where he was going and what he woz gonna do but he obviousoly couldnt be bothered. Well i went to my cousins yesterday, they live in Oxted and have a mahoosive house and garden. I love it. Btw Jo one of my cousins is gonna be in the upper 6th at Oxted. Jo i will wear themed clothing if that is what you wish foir, although that will mean i will need to  go on another shopping trip into Croydon.... Thats not a bad thing though :) Have any of you been invited to a party at Goff's house on the Saturday? ( day after Helen and Pennies) I have been invited but i dont want to go if no one is gonna go ! Oh yea, i still cant work out how you get pictures on here, its too confusing Well that is it from me - The wisdom woman, farwell and goodbye

And half the people who I thought were my friends have either refused to dress up to my party, or are putting me second by saying, oh btw I'm only coming an hour before the end cos I can't be assed to turn up for the whole time. Great. Thanks a bunch, 'friends'. I am really pissed off righ tnow.

       Admit what? Did Nicki fancy your friend Jackie? Is that what all the strange italics is about? Anywya, Jo's party was brill last night, it was a proper house party (ie parents cleared out and we had the run of the downstairs etc and the garden), and all in all it was a good laugh! Today I went to work and i've been on my feet all day, they are aching sooooo much! There is sod all on the tv tonight apart from the Euroviaion thing that I WON'T  be watching, especailly as those gay Russian girls are singing. And of course dad is so busy cementing the patio he can't go out to blockbusters, so it looks like I'm going to be reduced to doing some revision tonight. How marvellous. Anyway, cya later guys

       German reading yesterday. They spent about half an hour faffing about. Idiots. But no more German! Ever!!!!!! I wnet to see The Matrix Reloaded with Jackie as she said. Yes it was nice seeing  a boy from my primary school that i havent seen for 5 years ! It was nice seeing him after all that time.  Hehe. Mwahahaha. I loved the film. I don't think it was better or worse than the first. I think its partly because of the way the directors designed the triolgy. As with most trilogys the first film like X-men introduces you to the characters and the story. In this case its helping us to understand the Matrix. Now the 2nd and 3rd films will be jam packed of action as we see neo work out he reasons why he is The One. Btw, Neo is an agagram for one. Hehe.

It was nice seeing him after all that time. The film was great, lots of action and suspence, although i do believe that the first film was better as it woz more interesting. Now all i have to do is wait until The Matrix Revolutions comes out in Novemeber. Well for those of you that went to Jo. C birthday party, did you have fun? or woz andy's party better? Big Brother has finally arrived, YAY. I already hate one of the housemates called anouska, she is so annoying and loud, she is up for eviction so that is good.

       Yeha, I though that was quite okay actually, easier than the praactice exams that we were given!! I thought the ROll of Thunder question was a bit tricky tho, asking all this nonse about how much has Cassie learnt of the right and wrong wasy to live? Ridiculous. Anyway, I thought it was okay. I never bother to plan cos it just wastes my time, and I never pay any attention to the plans anyway, so from my experience it;s more worthwhile for me just to start writing, and worry about what I do next when I do actually get stuck, which thankfully dind't happen. But I guess everyone is different! I suddenyl think iof random things to write.  So, History revision class tomrrow, I hope you're going Nicki otherwise I'll be lonely! Then a week off- bliss!  CAn't wait, havent' got all tht much planned though because I want to do a lot of revision.

       Oh yea baby! I kicked ass on that exam!!!!!!!! Eng Lit is the only exam I ever look forward to you know because I never find them incredibly hard like maths or science. The only problem I had in that exam was that I kep forgetting to start a spiderdiagram or a list of things to include in the essay so each time I wrote the introduction THEN did a small list above that. I think it will be okay though. That lepricorn teacher and another English teacher are so rude! They stood right by my table chatting away, flapping pieces of paper right by my ear while I was trying to work. How rude! They could have distracted me (which they did) and damaged my chances of a good grade! Then the lepricorn put her cup of coffee ON MY DESK. HOW OUTRAGEOUS!!!!! I had a good mind to knock it off 'by accident' but couldn't be bothered. Too much effort really. Good luck everyone! I hope you did well!

       Yes! never ever have to sit through another music lesson ever, anything I do to do with music will be strictly voluntary from now on! And to celebrate, Tom and I have had simulatneous book burnings! I burnt my book which wasn't entierly successful, firstly it wouldn't light, and when it finally caught light some dead leaves caught alight too, and set fire to the fence!! OOPS! when I'd finished, I cam back up and found a folder full of notes and songs from choir, which of course I had to burn too! This was a little more successful, I went down behind the wall at the bottom and created a nice little bonfire, whihc burnt very well for about half an hour until it started to rain. But all my music is now reduced to ashes, which actually feels like a great relief. Ok, so it's vandalism. Ok it ruins the atmosphere. And ok, a few flowers got singed. But hey,. it'ss a weight off myh mind!

His genius is only surpassed by his love and understanding of other people.  He makes for a great companion with much affection, plus, the baldness *is* kinda sexy.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate?

       Morning. I hope Jackie's PE goes wall today! And anyone else who has an exam!    Your ideal mate is Bobby Drake.  With his innocent sweetness and his boyish good looks, how can any girl go wrong?  He's the type of guy to supply you with all the TLC that you can handle, and he'll always be there for you when you need moral support, or just a shoulder to cry on.  Though he is still young, he lacks the experiences of life, and can be naive.    urlLink   Who Is Your Ideal X-Men 2 Mate? (ladies only)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Well, i had my french oral today, it woz well hard and i hated every god damn minute of it. I think i did okay though, probably got half marks? I got health and Eduaction, i would say they were the best 2, cause environment is well hard and so is youth culture ans future plans. Well my next exam is PE so i really have to revise a lot for that, i want to get an A and i know that i can get it if i try really hard. I would say it is my best subject so fingers crossed. Does anyone want to come Job hunting with me? I want to go into croydon some time next week and have a look. Well thats it from me.

       well wht lovelly weather today. I got up about 9am this morning and pottered around for 3 hours, then decided to clear out my room, seeings as I have a huuuge amount of junk stashed away.I started with under my bed, where I foudn a ridiculour number of plastic carrier bags and loads of old chritsmas cards, then I moved onto my desk which contained thousands of unwanted, unloved, unused pens, which promptly went in the bin. NOw if you come into my room you can see the carpet, and it is possible to find what you want in my desk, which is quite an achievement. I also got round to changing the sheets and vacumink all the dust of the paintwork, and then I did an hour's revision before lunch and Neighbours! Since then I have been reivising/chatting on messenger, cos the weather is so foul I can't really be bothered to do anything properly at the moment. I've got to go out before 4pm to be at school for our first Austria rehersal, which I am so not looking forward to. If I get stuck in the front row I will scream, I really will! Also, Mrs Hicks reckons we need a bass guitar for a couple fo songs, so I dread to think what she's got in store for us, probably a shed load of stupid gospel songs that require singing stupid words and waving our arms around like loonies, cos that's what we usually end up doing. Only this year we've got Mrs Kent too, who altough she is nicer than Mrs Hicks, she picks out the most ridiculous songs for her choirs to sing.  Oh well, the joys of music. Even though my street cred is going ot be ruined after this, at least I'm leaving you lot here!  Must go finished some revision before I have to go and suffer torture, toodle pip guys!

       OOOH, also they do it so the first 2 people get the first set of topics, then the second 2 people get the second set of topics, and so on. So if you're clever enough (but it's a bit c onfusing) you could work out what you may have! But that is a bit too confusing!

       Well thank God the aurals are over and done with! I think mine went quite well, or at least Madame Slark was grinning the whole way through, lol! Jackie, in case you wanted to know, the topics that go together are: Self and Family + Environment Health + Education Youth Culture + Future Plans Anyway, for the rest of the morning Tom, Doe, Alex and I sat on the grass and had a laugh at Mr Weston who seemed quite embarrased that we all knew about the poster- nice one Nicki! Alex then walked home, and we went to my house via the chip shop, and had chip butties! I can't believe that Tom and Doe hasve never had chip butties! They weren't the best I've ever had cos really you need thicker bread, more butter and hotter chips, lol! But next time, we have to have fish finger sandwiches, they are just the best!! Bananas are ucky in sandwiche tho! Anyway I've got to do some revision tonight seeings as I've been out all day, lol! See y'all later guys (hope your art is going ok Nicki!!)

       That was amusing. While talking to Pete last night he said Mr gallagher saw it, looked suprised but thinks he took it down. My sister said Seaward left the one on his door up and I think Mr Weston found his one amusing. It was fun while it lasted. I got an email from Mr Bennett because I sent him some of the ball pics as he wasn't there. He wante dto know what Helen was doing in one of the pictures and I quote him when he says: "what is helen doing with her face in the limo?". I couldn't stop laughing at that. Anywho, yes. Got up about 20 mins ago. I have German second lesson then I'll be over to collect Jackie for lunch and revision. I have already have 2 texts from Doe and a phonecall from Jenny which didn't get far because her battery ran out. Brilliant. See you all later!

       Lol, today was fun, French for me was a waste of time, i thought we were gonna go through the oral topic so i was kinda annoyed at that. Nicki put the photos of the scicen lot drunk up round the school but within bout half an hour most of them had been taken down ! :( I dont think they like them much although Mr Moore did. Well after the french i went back to Nicki's house and we have now organised a revision session tmor in Croydon library, I cant beleuve im doing it but there ya go ! Hehe. Well nothing much more to say. I'm off

       ok Well I finally got my necklace back (he he!) after Jackie forgot, so I went to science revision and Jackie went home to get it for me. I went to french second lesson which was actually quite handy, and then I went to see Miss Bashir with Scott and ssarah which was VERY helpful! She's set up a few more dates when we can go in adn see her to go through loads of stuff. Which is useful. Tomorrow I'm doing some more revision (wow!) and going in at 2.30 to see Miss Bashir. Then more work on my french aural, and then mum and I are going to spend the whole day on Wednesday going through them all so I'm fully prepared for Thursday, cos I'm soo nervous about it!  Other than that the day has been really boring, cos I've been revising all day! Not much to say really, so I'm going to go now! Bye

       Yeh he he he he! I had so much fun last night, boogeying and mingling and socialising!  It was absoulately fab, far better than I thought it was going to be! The teachers were hilarious though, all smoking like chimneys and half of them turning up pissed or stoned! What a bad example to set! Anyway, I thorogulsy enjoyed myself and I will remember that night forever, I really will. It was absoultely brilliant, even down to the last details like Mrs Kent beeping at us on the motoway cos we were all waving out the windows like looneys, oh and of course Oliver winning Best Smile, he was in his element last night! I really thoroughly enjoyed myself, thank you all for making it so special for me! I got to go guys, my hair is still a mess, see you at Andy's!

       I think it was nice of him to write that because he was putting something personal about you rather than a simple 'good luck' like some teachers. Like in mine he wrote something thast really only I would understand properly. Madness. Well ya'll know about my wrist problemo yah? Well I got my mom to look at it (she used to be a nurse) and its def swollen so its def worse that it was! Nooooooooooooooooo! Oh yea, Tom you havn't finished writing in my boooooooooooooooooooook!

So Nikko, see me tomorrow and you'd better get writing! Anyway, in maths today I think Mr Blincoe was trying to suggest that we devise a method of cheating in the maths exam cos he said we need to have a signal to show what is wrong. OH dear, I really hope he wasn't serious, but he sounded as if he was. RE was ok cos we wacthed 'My Big fat Greek Wedding' which is such a funny film! None of my class seemed to get the jokes tho, I htink it was a bit wasted on them! I'm not writin gmuch cos I'm so excited about tomorrow and FRIDAY! I'm gonna just be a ball of e xcitement! If you can be that! But hey! Got to go cos I think Neighbours might be starting soon, bye!

       P.S: If I'm totally insane tomorrow, it's because Louise has spent all morning downloading tracks on the net and burning them onto a CD. It wouldn't be so mad if these songs were decent, but they happen to all be by Alvin and the Chipmunks, and range from things such as 'Play that Funky Music' to 'Macarana' and 'Time Warp'. They are truly dreadful, and to make it worse they're sung by cabbage chipmunks.

       Awww! Very amusing. I didn't do that IQ thing either, I didn't know it was on. I can't actually remember what I did last night. OHyeah I can, I was revising with mother, which was actually helpful. Today I got up about 9.30, ate a leisurley breakfast (cos everyone was alrady up and in the garden), oitered around my room listening to music and chilling, and finally got dresed aboyut 11am. I then did 2 hours on maths before lunch. After lumnch I lay in the hammock in the sun for an hour, then I got attacked by Nancy cos apparently I was a pirate and I might attack the ship she was sailing round the garden. So I grabbed a plastic sword and started fighting back, and it ended with her walking the plank. I then took over the sh ip, but got bored after a while a decided to jump up and down on the exercie trampoline. Then my legs got wobbly so I gave up, went back inside and did some more music appreciation, ha ha. Then I went out for a biyccycle ride with my down all across these fields and stuff, and I can tell you, boy does my back-side hurt. But anyway! I'm going to do some history revision later, and I'm going to do some more science with mother tonight. Toodles pip for now guys (seeings as MSN isn't working), and see you all tomorrow!

       Well I stayed in bed for about half an hour and then my dad convinced me to help him in the garden. Lawn mower doesn't work. So lets go inside and see if I can get the computer to work. Oooo, I know what the problem is, why don't I just move the hard drive into the other computer and then look at it? Good idea, I thought. So I did. Then it caught alight and smoke started to rise out of the computer. Back to the drawing table. Bloody cabages, should have stayed in bed.

       Very good. Unfortunatly I can't do these tests without getting a false mark, so I won't bother. For the following paragraph, replace the word 'cabage' with something that ryhmes with "ducking" and starts with "f". A terrible day. Tried to dig a cabage hole for a cabage plant in the cabage garden, but some cabage idiot built the cabage garden on cabage clay so I can only go about cabage 10cm. Another one of my cabage computers has decided that computer-cabage-life isn't just worth cabage living and is now sulking in the corner of the room not doing anything. I have a cabage head-ache and I can't cabage think straight. It's half past cabage eleven and I'm going to cabage bed.

       Jackie, seeings as I have only just got onto Blogger I will still answer your question! We went into Croydon this morning because you wanted a necklace and a hair accessory for Friday's Leavers Ball. We looked in every shop possible (lol!) and in the end you bought a clear clippy thing that you can put in your hair in about 6 differernt ways for an 'up-do'. Let me know how it goes and how you're going to have you hair! You didn't buy a necklace though. Tom bought some stuff in Next and something in Smiths that completely escapes my mind, and then he bought Die Another DAy in HMV, where he also paid for my Harry Potter CD because he had a voucher to use (but there is money sitting here next to me waiting to be given to him on Tuesday morning!). Then we went home because I had a rehersal to get to, and by the time I had got home I had 10 minutes to eat lunch before I had to go out again! I then went to a rehersal for my concert next week, and I think it's going to be a really good one, even if I say so myself. Imagine 6 clarinets all playing melodiouys and spectacular tunes, and that's what you;'ll get next Sunday! One boy is totally hopeless though, I think he's gonna be kicked out and replaced, lol!!!  Anyway, I have just done a make-up trial for the ball and have decided against weird and wonderful makeup, I'm just gonna go with natural colours on!! Nothing blue or purple, I'm gonna look normal. ANyway, my hair is gonna be quite, um, different, so I don't wanna over do it. Other than that, I'm all sorted now! yay! I'm so excited about it!  I'm going to do some revisoin this evening, and apparently we're going out for a family day tomorrow. Yippe. ACtually, we haven't been out anywhere for ages, so it should be good. Better go, I think I have to go and cook a vegetable curry!

       Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Well today I went to work again. Interesting day in all, encoutered the Warlingham May Queen, a very sexist man, and an old lady who links singing and bendy toilet brushes. Other than that the day was pretty routine, and I get to learn how to use the till next Saturday! How fun!! Sounds sad, but it all looks quite fun really, swiping credit cards and stuff!  Um. Other than that, I was awake half the night last night because I kept having dreams about the ball, and I was so excited about leaving I hardly slept a wink! Hope I get some more sleep before Friday, otherwise I won't make it to the ball! Anyway, we're having a ridiculoursly early dinner otnight cos Nancy has friends round, so better go! Byeeeeee. BTW, see you 10,.30 tomorrow morning Jackie!

       I may pop over to see you but I need someone to go with me. Jackie?? Any takers?    This Is Your Song   Live your life to the fall With a lifetime of smiles Made us know right from wrong Always knowing a lie  You made us to be tough But never too rough Rise above what you said Never easily lead.  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  So I'll try and go on Loving all that we know Through the hardest of times you put on a show  You made us stand tall When all around us would fall Even when you were alone You believed you could fly  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song I wrote it for you It won't take all day Just a minute or two  You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song  And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song We wrote it for you It'll take all our lives Just to help us get through You were a friend Walk with you to the end And one day we'll all sing along 'Cause this is your song.

       Well if you want somebody to come I am around on that Sunday - chat to me on MSN. We are leaving school! Finished required education! The fact most of us have 2 years of 6th form followed by 3 or 4 at Uni doesn't really matter, but you get the idea! Hehe. I'm actually nervous, and I know I ain't the only one! I've changed my book writing thing slightly, I'm going to buy a book with lined pages for peeps to write messages in and I'm going to use a blank book for signitures from random people and staff, plus I want people to draw a picture of themselves - just something slightly different from the normal thing. I have the photos from the skating, however I didn't use a fast enough film because the shop didn't have it, so unfortunatly they came out really dull, which I am quite annoyed about, but I have got some much faster film now - just got to try again! Jackie was talking about another Thorpe Park trip in July sometime? I can't remember the date, but what do we think? Anyway, I need my beauty sleep, about a decades worth, g'night.

        Well. HEre I am, at last! What a disguisting day. Raining, all day long. There was a brief period of glorious sunshine at about 4pm this afternoon, but since about 5pm it's been simply horrible! Dioesn't crap weather just make you feel awful? I really hope it doesn't do this next Friday, cos a) we're gonna get our outfits soaked, and b) my hair'll get ruined!! But hey! I've got the camera sorted now, mum says I can borrow hers cos it's easy to load and stuff, and she's got me a couple of spare films for lots of snapping away! They're gonna be my last memories of Warlingham, so they'd better be good ones, he he! I am so excited about next week, I can't wait! eveyrone I know has to write in my book, plus put their phone numbers and addresses and stuff! And I'm gonna get some of my faveourite teachers to write in there too, ha ha! So nothing too rude in their guys! And of course camera is coming in every day, to be put to good use! THink I should have a couple of good piccies from today at lunch, all of us girlies!  Anyway, tomorrow I am going to work, again! Then I will probably try a bit of revision in the evening. Sunday I;'m revising and then I've got a rehersal for a concert that I'm playing in next Sunday. Does anyone want to come? I know you probably all don't, but just in case you want to find out what I work my guts out for all the time, you can come along to All Saint's Church in Sanderstead at 3pm, Sunday 11th May to watch me play 1st in a sextet that I'm playing. But none of you lot will proably wanna come, but hey. LAst ever chance to see JoJo in a concert, ha ha! Other than that, not much, sounds sad but I'm really lookng forward to getting back on Tuesday so I can see eveyrbody and jump up and down with excitement and stuff! Lastly, are we gonna have a group photo at the ball? Or shall we just go in 2s or 3s? I don't think that we'll get eveyrone from our gruop in, so maybe it would be best to decide to go in 5s or summink? I dunno, I'll talk to donna see what she wants to do! Talk to y'all later guys

Nic is home :D  I am having children between the ages of 30-35. Final. Just thought I would state that.

       ha ha ha yes. I think that verba; abuse was from me, in the form of "Tom you're a bastard!!!!", "fuck", "I bloody hate you" and "piss off". Needless to say, all those insults were when I was on a ride that scared the crap outta me, and Tom had lied to get me on there! So yeah, once again excuse the language but I feel it was justified!!!

       We had such a kewl time at Pork Farm today!  We got there, and I went on Collossus 3 times, Nemesis 5 times, and Quantum 4 times. Also went on rapids, loggers leap, stampede, detonator, tidal wave.  The journey home was HILARIOUS! We were taking the piss outta richard, and we found a dumped babies pram in the bin, so we pulled it out and, um, well....used it.  As shown here....Honestly, I really wish I had my vid cam.......

       WE GOT STARTED ON! Basically we were sitting on the bus and there wioz this lairy girl on there. I was supposedly staring at her so he told me fuck off ect... Me being me, i rolled my eyes at her and muttered whateva under my breathe. She then goes " Dont talk about me bitch or i will knock you out, so once again i rolled my eyes and said "ok". Then the girl shut up and us lot carried on talking. The girl moved forward though and started listwening to our convo. We started talking bout tom and thorpe park. She then comes out with: Is that Tom going out with a girl called amy. So i replied no not likely. Then she started having a go at me cause of the way i said it! Us lot continued talking and then she came out with: Dont talk about me so i replied erm i wasnt! then she went on bout how she was gonna knock me out so Darren started laughing, then she started having a go at him ect... Then she shut up and wee continued talking until mine and darren stop, as we went to get off the bus she said: Don't even try looking at me or i will get off and beat the shit outta you. So Nicki decided to get offf the bus with me and darren! The whole time she was talking in a black persons voice thinking she woz well hard. Grrr i really hate peeps like that, she is such a hoe! thats it.

       Right, lets re-run last night. Its now 12:30.  Apparently I have a virus on my system. NAV is auto-protect enabled, and I have run 4 different types of FULL virus scans. No viruses were found, maybe meaning TOM has a virus. Good luck Tom :D

Oh, and I will give you my address when I next see you if you don't have the full one already. That is if you even want mine!  Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy!  wa? Can you flesh that out a bit please..... Glad you guys had fun at the concert :) I was listening to my sisters Bon Jovi album and it is pretty good. I prefer Bryan Adams though.  Bless you Max you really are obsessed. Posting on ere at 3 in the morning. Outrageous. Do you not sleep? Well today I am doing sod all so if anyone wants to go to the park to sunbathe and generally just mill about down there contact me before 1. LOL.

       Nothing can beat the tan I have on my waist :D Ok, ok, odd place, but its natrual and it kinda fades as it goes up my body. :S strange. Oh well, Nic likes it, lol.  There is a section of carpet in my room which STRONGLY smells of cheese, its awful. So, I went downstairs and under the sink was this Febreeze stuff (u must of heard of it on TV), so I thought I would give it a try. I sprayed it on, and the smell has gone all round the house. I now have a headache because of the strong Febreeze smell. I HAVE TO SLEEP WITH IT TONIGHT, ITS RIGHT BY MY BED :@ I would need Nic in bed with me to take my mind off it :D  Talking of Nic...   :D  P.S: That first picture of nic is the desktop background on my laptop :D

       I don't miss any science experiments cause they were always rubbish and most of the time we did them wrong ne way! And yes i admit i did the hands on bit except if it was to do with water and then i ended up having water fights with andy and max and getting shouted at by either micheele or Nicki to come and help! Oh the joys of science. I believe that pigs cannot fly as: 1. They have no wings 2. They are fat 3. they are useless 4. they just can't okay? Now i think i have eaten my dinner too quickly as i now have a rather annoying stomach ache which is pissing me off, maybe i just need the toilet??? LOL, jokes. No i don't i only went 10 mins ago! Now i am making an effort today to write as long blog as usually mine are really short and boring and i'm sure none of you guys/ gals read it cause i always seem to write about the same things! I would just like to say that i am really excited about Thorpe park and i can't wait to go on collosus and Nemises inferno... Again! I am also looking forward to my holiday as it will be great fun and i will come back with a smashing tan to put you all to shame! hehe. The only thing i'm not looking forward to is WAXING me legs ect... Cause you know i have to have beautiful legs cause i dont wanna be walking around all stubberly and looking like a man wearing a bikini/ swim suit. Now i would like to know your adresses so that just in case i decide to send a  postcard i can send one to you lot, usually i dont send postcards but i thought i would try something new this year! hmmm... What else can i write about? Oh yea i can write about everybody who fancies Simon the new boy! But i wont cause that is just boring. Now me i like the boy that was wearing the top with no arms, he had a sexy look to him, although i know for a fact he wouldnt look at me twice! Now i would like to say school sucks and that i hate it, but me being silly i am going back to take some stupid subjects then i'm gonna be even more stupid and then go to Uni. Although i havent decided on that yet as i dont know what i wanna do. That makes it slightly difficult when choosing courses and stuff. Now by now i should think your all thouraghlly bored stiff from reading the crap i have writeen above so i will sign off here!  Goodbye

       Hmm. Well as much as I need to get a job really I can't this summer because I will keep asking for days off here and there for that U-Project trip I am on. So I would probably get sacked within....2 weeks? Well I will def get a job towards the end of the summer/begining of sixth form because that is when all the Uni folk will quit their jobs as they head off to uni and their holidays with their friends. Hmm, this shall be interesting because what I am actually do right now is just typing so I can see if people actually read the posts on here. So I am going to ask and say random things, I will only know if you have read it by you mentioning it so lets have a lookie and see where this experiment goes. Speaking of experiments does anyone miss science experiments? I know in our set 1 class they could sometimes be hard but I thought our was of actually doing them was funny. Geting in one large group of 7 rather than the 3/4 we were supposed to be in...LOL. Then of course everyone has their own jobs. ie: I would take results, Max would time, Andy would refill the acid of whatever, Jackie always did the hands on part. It worked and made it fun. Hmm...can pigs fly? That's a scientific question. For my birthday this year I want to do something crazy...yes...I want to go horse riding! Woo! I have never been before and I think it would be a laugh. Hmm..I wonder if they have any jobs going at the nearby stables. That would be great. Working with horses. Ok ok, so it'd be mucking out but hey, its stil work and its physical work so it would look good to any future employers. Wahey! Sorted. I think. Moose.

       The 6th form induction days were ok. I took on that day ICT, AVCE Business, Media Studies, Design Tech. Then we left for daves at the beginning of 5th lesson for a sleepover. That was great fun; we dragged the dancemat, PS2, TV, DVD's, laptop and some other stuff downstairs to muck around with. In the morning, I got up and went down to the newsagent to get a copy of PCZONE UK, which has previews of Max Payne 2! Yay!  On my way home from Daves (I has to walk from Selsdon to Caterham) I thought to myself "Ah, I bet im gonna see somebody I know walking down Limpsfield Road, I bet it'll be Robert". Sod's law came into play; so yes, I saw Rob with his boyfriend walking down Limpsfield Road. At the bus stop just before I saw Rob, I thought I saw Nicki.J at the bus stop, and as my eyesight isn't very good, I couldnt make out who the person was, but I thought it was Nic. It turned out to be Robs mum! :-/  Hey! I walked through the park today on my way home! It was about 12:00 ish. When did you lot get there?  I can't resist posting this: (Sorry Nic!) :D    YUMMY!!!   My plan of the week: Saturday - Cry because Nic is going away for the whole week. Sunday - Nothing. Monday - Thorpe Park. Tuesday - Nothing. Wednesday - Nothing. Thurdsay - Nothing. Friday - Cry because i'm so happy Nic is coming home! :D Saturday - Talk to Nic. Sunday - Go to park with Nic!!!!! YAY!!!!!!

       Well guys! Won't be here for a while so I'm apologising in advance Nicki! Won't be around at all tomorrow, might make it Sunday morning, but after that I won't be around until WEdnesday night or possibly thursday due to my hectic schedule! Anyays, Gimmie something for the pain, gimmmie something for BLUEEEES, gimmie me somethig for the pain that I feel when I'm hanging on a hangman's nooooose, gimmie something for the pain, gimmie something I can usseeeee, can't remember the rest! oh no! Back to the CD! I'm listening to the White Stripes "Elephant" at the moment, it's really good! 'Seven Nation Army' is wicked, but there are some really good acoustic tracks on it too, I would think that Max and Nicki would proably like it, not sure whether Tom and Jackie would though?! Anyways......... Hmmmm. Cinema was good last night, 'Bruce Almighty' wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be, actually had me laughing quite a lot! Anyways, lolooking forwa rd to BonJovi soooooo much! I Can't describe how mcuh! Plus thorpe park too, h eh ehh e! Bye now, gtg to work!

       Today - park (hopefully but it looks like its gonna rain, grrr) Saturday - nothing Sunday - nothing Monday - nothing Tuseday - Keanu Film Day with Ashleigh Wednesday - Thorpe park! Thursday - nothing Friday - nothing. And that is next week planned out. Go me and my brilliant social life!  I thought yesterdays taser lessons were interesting. I am loking forward to the art and textiles courses although I was not impressed with the textiles taser. I mean, it was like being in a taster lesson for year 7. I sat there and weaved for 30 minutes. I mean, aaargh! Its so feminine! And sterotypical of women! Yes yes, I know its hard for the teachers to do taster lessons but still. And they were doing that typical thing teachers do "Oh how lovely!" next person "That looks nice!" next person "I like that colour". Argh! They don't actually mean the compliments!!!!!! EEEEEEEEEE! But anyways, histroy was amusing. Westy couldn't spell my name right, he did Nicky, Nickee and Nickie. Duh. NICKI. Geology was well, chaos because I had no idea what to do and felt stupid all over again so here we go back into the same old science routine of me being dumb. Art taster was great, I produced a nice chalk and charcol shell whcih I am rather pleased with and Miss Starky seemed to like it as well. English Lit I am really looking forward to. War literature and all. Engjoyed that. Amusing lesson.

       Ooooooooo! I like this new version of blogger! Very swish!!!!!! Today should be amusing. Taster lessons and the whole chaos of it. I feel sorry for the external students, they won't know where half the rooms are! Bless! Slight panic last night. The fire alarm went off!! But there was no fire. So I am knackered now for wondering what the hell was going on. Hey, at least we know it will wake us up if there was an actualy fire.

       Well hello guys. I don't actually know why I'm saying hello though, seeings as you're all at school for your induction day, in which case: hope it's going/went well! I've just got back from my mum's work- I went to see if Harry Potter was delivered but it wasn't; so I've come back annoyed and I'm now munching through a box oc chocolates to make me feel better, lol. Probably just end up feeling sick. Oh well! Anywho, weather looks a bit grim today, cloudy, threatening to rain, and where I am it smells like a bonfire, yet again! Yuck mocha. *bins current chocolate* I dunno what to do now. I was hoping to read hp, but it isnt here so I'm annoyed, as previously stated. I suppose there's always the tennis to watch, but the minute I turn on the tv it'll start raining in wimbledon and they'll have to abandon play, it always happens when I sit down to watch! Anyway we know what'll happen: One of the Williams sisters will win the ladies, Tin Henman will do a dramatic crash out in the quater finals, and some obscure russian will win. Probably. well like I said, hope everything went ok today, I can't wait for my indcutvion day next week, hopefully it'll be good! talk yo y'all later now

       Aww, sorry your Alton Towers trip has gone wrony. Maybe in that summer between collage and uni you guys can actually go for a weekend? Stay in a hotel and all that jazz. Jenny has a birthday on 7th August which I am not here for because of my summer trip. I get to go go-karting! Yippe! Proper helmets and all! Yes I agree Tom, they don't realise how lucky they are. Even if their birthday is in the summer most people are free to go to the cinema or something. Birthdays in Decemember just don't work well. But i am used to it now so I don't bother with my birthday anymore. Its pointless so no need to make a fuss. As much as I would like a surpise party or something it just wouldn't happen. What is everyones plans for the summer then? The induction days are on wed and thurs. Tomorrow I am going shopping in London with my sister. At some point father and I will be going to the war & peace show which I can't wait for. Tom and I have 2 trips planned which should be a blast. Jackie and I will be off to Thorpe Park next week with Ben and Si, yay! That is about it.

       One of the best things was too see everybody so relaxed! No more exam stress, just chilling out. So thanks Jo. Unfortunatly Railtrack or Network Rail or whatever on earth our train network is called at the moment, have moved a few stations around and in the doing so, they moved the train that goes to Alton Towers. So now, not only is the journey longer, but we get less time in the park, and they put the price up! The cheek of it! There is a big difference between 33 and 38 for a day out. So I'm giving cheques/cash back to people because I don't think it's really worth it any more. Grrrrrrrr. Flipping trains. The next birthday I believe is Jackies? 23rd or 24th of July? Followed by Max's on the 23rd or 24th of August. All these people with nice summer birthdays! Lucky things you are. Don't know how good they've got it, do they Nicki? ;)

       This is a celebrity blog as I am blogging from Andy's house! We taking part in the Warlingham Fate tomorrow and our Brazil team have a stall there. We have crockery and a few bits and bods to throw balls at. Hopefully get a load of money to help towards our trip. The ICT exam was pretty much as expected, only one question got me was "Name four features of the 1998 Data Protection Act" which I could not remember at all, but never mind. After talking to Barry, I am on the C/B border. That's it! All over! No more exams, and now a nice relaxing extra long summer to look forward to. Andy is watching every word I type, so I better not let out too many secrets, hehe. Looking forward to what should be a very interesting party tomorrow!

       Hi Hi Hi. Well today I accompanied my friend Sarah job hunting, she's so fussy though! She can't work saturdays cos she dances, she can't do after school because she dances, so basically she wants a holiday job that lets her leave at 3.30 everyday, and no weekends. hmmm. We started off in Hamsey Green, but no luck their, just a lot of application forms. We then walked down to sanderstead and we thought we'd got osme luck cos there was s sign in the bakers, but they said they'd already filled it, they just hadn't bothered to take the sign down! So no luck in the rest of the shops in Sanderstead, so we hopped on a bus into Croydon. Clarks said they take on holiday people which was good so we collected a form, and Clintons had a vacancy but it included a Saturday, so no luck. every other shop (Marks, BHS, Alders, HMV, Virgin, Waterstones etc etc) said they haven't got any vacancies till August/October/Christmas. Fun. So we then walked out of Croydon along the Brighton Road to go to 2 music shops, and no luck either! Collapsed into a bus stop on the Brighton Road, looked up and saw a restaurant had a sign in the window advertising for waiters/waitresses, so we went in as a last resort, cos she could do that as it would be evenings! The people in there were so nice and I got a free drink while I waited for her so I was happy after a long day! She got a trial, and then the bloke told me I could aswell! So we're both trainee Waitresses now, lol! Very strange day. Went all round the world, ended up with a job I didn't know I wanted, and then spent the rest of the afternoon in Selsdon Primary photocopying log books from 1955.  Can't be assed to go to IT cos I went yesterday and it was pants, so I'm going to do some revision of my own. Perhaps. Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?!

       Hello, The park woz good fun, i now have sun burn which hurts but not as much as my shoulder, that bloody kills, stupid tarmac. I'm now very tired and we hopefully go to bed early, but probably not.

       Well hello people. What a bizarre day it was yesterday weather-wise! Sunny and warm in the morning, but by the time I got off the tube in London, it was chucking it down! Then, when I came out of a shop, it was beautifully sunny again! Fortunately my friend and I avoided all the rain, because we decided to get a bus back to Victoria instead of the tube, cos we couldn't acutlly find a tube station and we didn't fancy getting wet! The bus was quite odd, we got a seat so it was the first time we'd sat down all day, and it was some dodgy old bus that took us practically half way round london on it's way to victoria, but at least we got to see some nice places, lol!  Today the weather is beautifully sunny again (although it's quite windy), which  is a damn good job too, cos I'm going to be out and about again today! The only problem is the wind, so I'll have to go and do a wind test with my clothes- put on one outfit, stand in the garden for five minutes and see how cold I get, then change to the next outfit and so on until I get a combination that I'm happy and warm in, lol! Anyone else have any strange methods of deciding what to wear?  Anyway, must go because my hair is an absolute mess and I've got to deal with it pronto! Have fun at the park (whoever's going!) and I'll probbaly talk to some of you lot later! Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

       Ok Jo. Fair enough.  Today I am going into Croydon with Jackie because we both have some shopping to do. So that should be a good laugh. I never did go to the garden centre because I went to Jackie's house instead and went on her dance mat. I cannot do it at all!!! I get all confuzzeled. While I was doing the lessons Jackie was whooping at some kids in their paddling pool. Hmm. Anyone guess what Jackie will be when she is older...... LOL. Jokes.

       What lucky folk you are.  I have been having a bit of a bad weekend to say the least. But I will discuss that in a mo. First of all tomorrow I have a textiles exam. Woppe. In the afternoon I am going to the garden centre with father because I need to get a proper cactus house for my cactuses because after 3 years of neglect they are alive! So now I intend to keep them all nice and healthy. Tuseday I am going to Croydon with Jackie to get Jo's pressies. I am also intending to but myself a few CD's and some matrix posters....hehe. Wednesday we should have the park. Loads of people haven't emailed me back on whether they are coming or not yet. Grrr. So spread the word people. Thursday I am not sure what I am doing. Friday is the day of reckoning with the Information Communications Technology test. Sorry, I think it sounds so much better athn ICT or IT. LOL. Today I have been reading on of my books. Did you do in WHSmith you can get any 2 books for ust 10? That is a good deal, and they have some good books on the shelves too!  So my dilemea. I have the sixth form letter. And guess what. I have subjects that clash. Wopee. But then guess what. The 2 subjects which clash are the 2 subjects I reeeeally need to do for my future career. Grrr. I wouldn't care so much if I had to drop Geology or English lit but I have to choose between HISTORY and ART/TEXTILES. HOW THE HELL DOES THE FLIPPING SIXTH FORM EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? I MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE COURSES!!!!!!!!!! I will be on a rampage tomorrow as I must go and complain to Miss H then to Mr V. Anyone care to join me? Grrr.

       Grrrr, i hate my computer. Well i went to Croydon today, the main reason was cause my sister forgot to take the photo chip with her to wokr this morning, so i went in and gave it to her. The most surprising thing was that she then payed for my bus fairs and ALSO brought me lunch !!! I then went on to buy myself some nice shorts for which i am wearing now and a top, which on the back has written: kik my arse, or something to that effect. I have also sunbathed today although not for too long as it was a bit too hot unless it weent hazy! Ne way enough said by mee, until the next time i blog...

       Today I have done nothing apart from get up, eat, and turn my hair a bizarre colour. Other than that I've been relaxing in the garden, now a small matter of exams is out of the way (well, apart from that thing called IT that I really don't intend to revise for!). Got quite a busy week planned, what with heart scans, day trips, revision classes and birthday parties all in the mix, but I'm looking forward to it because I only have to step onto the school premises for one occasion next week, and that would be the thing they call  IT, yet again. But gtg dry my hair now, and hope it hasn't turned green, cos it sure smells mighty funny at this moment in time. Toodles peeps

I also managed to get a top for Jo's party but the only problem with it is that I have to get someone else to tie it up at the back. Lol. So no one better un-do it. Grrr. I also brought some fish net tights! Again LOL. And I got some hair straighters which are cool because yes, they actually work! Wooo! What a really nice day it is today. Who wants to go down the park next week? So long as it is hot that is. I am thinking Wednesday. Tell me what you think.

       Grrrr, im a tiger! Well in my head maybe? I'm kinda bored at the moment, there is nothing to do anymore unless you have bucket loads of cash to randomly spend, and even if you have bucket loads of cash you still can't go out cause your mates havent got any money! You just can't win these days.  Well i have a very weird dream last night and it involved Ben Webb, i won't go into too much detail, but he was in jail in the peodofile unit and i was in a seperate bit but aslo in jail! Unfortuantly i woke up so i can't remember much more than that. All i know is that it was quite weird. I don't even know why we were in jail! grrrr. Well later on today i am going into Croydon with Darren to get a Father's day present for my Father and hopefully i am going to get Jo's present also, But i might just not bother getting Jo anything. ( I hate her) Nah i'm jokin, it all depends on whether i can find what i am looking for! Today looks like it is gonna be good, hopefully i can top up my tan so that when i go on holiday i will already be tanned and people will think i have be there for ages already! Lol. Well thats all i can think to write about at this time so i will sign off! GOODBYE

       Goodness me! Goff is still on MSN Messenger! Dear oh dear. History. I'm not really sure. I'm pretty confident I got at least a C for paper 2, because I was very revised up on that (thanks Jo!) but paper 1, I'm not sure I did very well at all on, like everybody else. So I really am on the C/D border for that. Not particually happy, but hey, either that or go live in a ditch. Yes! That's it, exams are over apart from some random ICT paper. All done and dusted. So now is the time to start planning the summer, and then at the end of the summer think about all the things you were going to do but never did because you spent your whole time going to parites or recovering from parties. My back really hurts now because the chair I was sitting in for all 1 hour and 45 minutes of that extra tireing Austria rehersal was all bent in the middle, so I couldn't sit up straight at all! Felt like somebody was poking me the whole time. Maybe it wasn't my chair and David was just being kinky. Hehe. Kinky sailors - why weren't hey in the history paper? One of my primary school buddies who I see every month-or-two was over this evening with her family, always good to talk about the good old days. Sort of miss them, but they were all snobs apart from a few of us. All at Trinity and other posh schools now. Don't care about us lot no more.  Jo - remind me about seeing her because she said something really nice you want to hear!  They have moved the 6th form timetable around a bit since I last saw it. So I am doing AVCE Media, Business & Economics and Geography. The plan is to do ICT, but I don't really fancy it, it's just the only thing I'm actually any good at. But it's either that or something else from 12B and 12D. Grrrr. I'll shut up now. One too many Cokes and a whole lot of ice cream!

       I had a veyr nice day thanks, sat in the sunshine and revised with Tom all afternoon. Thankfully the history exam today was a lot easier than the first one, uuuurgh. After the exam I got the bus into croydon with michelle cos I was supposed to be meeting my friend Sarah but Michelle ended up tagging along, and what an amusing day it was! Michelle made it her policy to try on the most ridiculous outfit in every shop, and boy did we laugh a lot! Quite a bit of a relief after the exams, and I'm happier now cos I know that Sarah is going to get on with my friends at ma party! yay! A week to go, h ehe! Gtg, I've just dropped ice cream on me keyboard so I bette clear it up! Be!

       I am 16 too. I have been so for 5 months (I think..is June the fifth month?) and 13 days. Welcome to the club Jo. I hoep you had a lovely day and I will give you your present at your party. Which I am looking forward to greatly. I have a skirt. Which is like a belt. Heehee.  The history exam was ok I thought. It went well. I have noticed something rather amusing in the history exams. Everyone does it including me. On each question no one just sits there and writes it all. Everyone tends to just sit there and not write or anything while they try and figure the question out. Its actually quite funny to watch. All these students with papaers open, only about 20 mins into the exam staring into space. LOL. How amusing.  Could Tom and Max please blog.

       Well, what an utter load of b******s that history exam was. Weston and his bloody 'Only revise the beginning and the middle cos you don't have to do questions on the end' and then what happens, the whole friggin' lot is on the end. Dammit. Well, actually more than damn it, I am very upset and very peed off with history teachers right at this moment in time. DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT DAMMIT. and a whoel load more of 4 letter words. you know, I actually opened the paper, saw the question and said "shit". I was that annoyed and upset. Reall pissed off. sorry to keep going on about, but I've worked so hard and it's all been ruined.  Other than that, It think maths was ok but it was definetly harder than the first paper, but that wasn't really a suprise to me cos I was expecting a hard ppaer, lol!  not looking forward to french tomorrow, but at least it's the last one, then I only have two more exams to go! yay! Plus it's my birthday on thursday so I get a nice relaxing day with no exams!" yay!

       I get freaky dreams. They are even freakier when they are about people you know and love and something bad is happenng to them. That's really horrible, when you wake up in a sweat and crying cos it's so scary and it seems real. I hate those type of dreams. Anyway! Science this morning was okish, harder than the other exam but Mr Stickland succeeded in messing up my questions 4- the minute I had done it anbd turned the page he said "I#m sorry to say that we've just noticed a mistake in question 4" and i thought 'oh bloody hell, here we go' and then I had to re-write the whole of the quesiton and made a mess of it. 5 minutes later, "I'm sorry but we made a mistake, there  wasn't  a mistake in question 4. So I had to re-write the whole bloody thing again, except I was out of space cos I had already written it twice. Honestly. Flamin' teachers. Right now I need some food. Marmite on toast followed by chocolate fingers sounds like a good idea.  Oh guys you will laugh so much when you see my birthyda cake, it's going to be so funny and soooo sickly!! he he he he!  Good luck in english everyone, although I'm sure no-one will need it cos you just make english up as y ou go along, being creative and arty-farty etc etc. Toooodles!

       I remember Umbongo, just not the song either. Just that it was hilariously funny. I had a freaky dream last night. The first bit was that Michelle didn't have a calaculator in the science exam today. Then this bit is to do with Jackie. It was  that day  in July and when the four of us got off the bus at  the destination  the other two circle of love members managed to rush off into  the lines  and we totally lost them. Hmm. It does not bode well hey? Well I am wetting myself about the science exam today. I will probablty be really depressed on my departure of the exam hall. Wopee. Althouogh I am looking forward to Thursday where Jackie and I will be shopping with the circle of love. That should be fun. Very fun. If you know what I mean Jackie. The group can bond. Heehee. Well, the internet is kinda boring lately although I have taken greatly to  urlLink faceparty.com . That is rather fun. I will also be getting my own domain in a few weeks which should be good.

       Umbongo, Umbongo, who else remembers the advert fomr when we were really ickle? My aunty used to give me umbongo cartoons cos I loved the advert on the Tv and i can still remember the pictures, but I can't remember the words! Aww. Just been looking at all our family photos from when we were really young and stuff, quite funny cos I was the fattest little child with the most awful hair ever, and i was always covered in food! lol, not much's changed then! Well work today was fun, Tina bought her daughter Kinnou in who is three, and she is sooo sweet! She's got cerebal palsy which means she is quite backward (being brain damaged), she is very very tiny and she can't talk properly, but she is such a happy and cheeky child it is soo funny! She was driving Tina beserk today cos she was tripping up all the customers cos she's so small and doesn't register what's going on around her, and then having sung happy birthday to herself and been told off by a customer for making too much noise (jokinlgy), she ran round and round the shop screaming it at him, following him everywhere, and then stood in the doorway and screamed it a t him as he walked off up the road, then turned around and burst out laughing- she is soo cheeky cos she knows she's been naughty! Anyway, to keep her out of the customers' way I tried to get her to help me dust the shelves, by giving her all the products and getting her to line them up on the floor. This was fine for a while until she decided she wanted to help me take stuff off the shelves too, so I gave her the small stuff to do because she can't managed anything else. She was taking the little liquid ant killer tubes off the shelf, and dropping them down onto the floor, and then she stepped forawrd to try and rech the ones at the back, and trood on the reast of the ant liquid tubes, and they exploded everywhere, covering the floor, my trousers and her ickly feet in sticky ant killer stuff. Yuck. And what does she say? "oopsey" and smiles cheekily at me. Kids eh??!

       Maths annoyed me. There was a question about the mean number and all I could think of was the advert where that man goes 'can you spot the mean number' and one number takes an ice cream from the other then hits him. Dammit. I would've been so depressed last night if it weren't for lovely Jackie. 2nd July.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Jo's party. 21st June.....hehe. Then I was thinking about Party In The Park. Whenever that is......hehe. Then I was reading the email Si sent me aasking fi I did actually want to go to the cinema or was it just Jackie messing about. Hehe.

       Well maths! Yay! I am actually quite relieved now cos I was dreading maths, but then I found it easier than the mock and it seemed to be largely based on algebra, which I find ok! I didn't get twhat a box plot was though, only to be told by Dina that it is the same as a box and whisker!! doh!!  That's annoying, but it's only 3 marks and I sholdu have worked that one out anyway, lol! So yyeah, ii am ok with that. Tomorrow I have englsih in the morning and Geography in the afternoon, 3 and a half hours in total of essay writing- not quite my idea of fun!

       yeah. French was quite blugh too. Evil. And then we got our ball pictures back which cheered me up. However, the lady in pupil services tried to bite my head off, so that wasn't good. But yeah it's a really nice picture that we've got, yay! And I saw Nicki's and she looked fab, I didn't see the rest of people though! I've just got back from makros and ASDA. In makros we bought all manner of fizzy drinks and sweets for my party (including 600 marshmellows!!!), and then in ASDA we bought lots of crisps and stuff, so we now have everything we need for a party! yay! I even pursuaded mmu to buy me my own personal supply of alcopops! yay!  Anyway got to go cos my eye is giving me grief, hope maths goes okay for everyone (I'm gonna fail). Bye!

       Wisewoman hey?  Yes, two things you should know about the wisewoman, first she is a woman!  Ah ha.  And the second...  ...she is wise?  Yeah! Do you know her then?  No, just a wild stab in the dark, which incidently is what you'll be getting if you don't shut up and tell me where she is.  My holiday was lovely. Best bit was when we took a yacht, found a deserted bay and went swimming - fantastic! Piccies back on Thursday so I'll post a few at the weekend or somethin'. Exams: blugh. 'nuff said.

       Rah well I'm guessing this is going ot be my last post for a while, as I'm off to Spain tomorrow morning! Yay! I bet it rains for the whole journey down there though, which won't be very interesting seeings as we have to drive cos my dad is too stingy to pay out for air fares. But hey ho, that's life I guess. Um. Other than that, I haven't been doing much at all! Yesterday I went to CAterham to the dentist, and that was a bundle of laughs as usual. Then bought a book on M15 since the Cold War and the changing faces of espionage whcihc will take my mind off things when GCSE results are out. Um, fun. Yeah, life seems to be all doom and gloom atm, i'm sure it's not really, just through a teenager's eyes it is. Well I can't really thnk of anythign else to say cos my jammy dodgers are yelling ast me from inside my tummy (i think I ate too many in too short a space of time), and, um, just to say hi Jackie an dMax have a nice summer, Nicki hope u had fun on your trip thingy, and Tom don't forget to go to work! Bye!

       I went into town yesterday, and I bought me a cosmic  urlLink ColourSplash Flash . It's like a normal flash, but it flashes different colours, making the subjects in your photos come out in beautiful ab-normal colours. Cosmic stuff. I also bought a pretty cosmic hippy top to add to my new look. Deep red, with black and white patterns. I've got all my Austria photos etc back! This photo below is taken outside the Tate Modern. Read the bin.   I'll look though the others and post a few goodies later.

       Homesickness is a pain, 10 days into the Morocco trip and I was missing Nic. (And home of course; they dont call it homesickness for nothing).  Well today has been interesting. Went to the park with Nic and she got a lift back to her house at the end, which as you know is like 200m up the road. I got very upset, considering I had to ride 2.5km back to Caterham. Ah well, that took me exactly 6 minutes to complete the journey :D  Onto other things, I'm painting Nics bedroom tomorrow. Should be fun :) Whey! About a week ago I got my Wireless router. I can now rome my house on the laptop using the internet wirefree and not have my main computer on to do so. Merry Christmas folks.

        I smell like water lily and lavender.  I just went swimming and my dad brought with us water lily and lavender shower gell. Cosmic. The tour was not as good as Prague, probably something to do with the weather (or at least I can blame it on the weather). A very alone tour for me because I didn't have all that many people to talk to. When I wasn't pissing Jo and Donna off, or hanging around with the year 8/9s I was all by myself, which isn't fun for a week. So I got rather home sick, which I don't usualy get when I'm away. My photos come back in 3 days time, so I'll post 'em up then. I've text Nicki to see how she is, but no reply yet. Glad to be home.

Other than that, raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah and now I am extremely tired even htough I've had about 24 hours sleep since I got home at 7am yesterday morning. Raaaaaaaaaah. Anywho, just bought some vegetable curry from Somerfield so must go cook and munch before I start on packing (yes packing raaah cos I'm going away again on Friday raaaaaah). Raaaaaaaah. Ask Tom about week, he knows more than I do generally raaaaah.

       Well, it has been a somewhat interesting week. I'm having Nic round on Friday, and we r going out for a meal :) I also sprayed one of my PC's black:    The white bits on the case is dust. The type of spray paint I used makes the dust stick like shit to a blanket. Also, I have yet to spray the CD-ROM drive. As you can see, it has been removed.

We all got into teams of 5, our team was me, Helen, Pennie, Shelly and Ashley's girlfriend Stacy. We lost. But we had fun! I have two nice bruises on the inside of my knees now from where I kept hitting the steering wheel, painful but worth it! I drive like a man apparently. Hehe. You know, instead of going around the corners nice and slowly I rip around. Well, I try to. Lol. I didn't crash! Woo!

       hmmmm, What to write? Well, my holiday was good, it only rained once and that was for 3 minutes. Getting a sunbed was bloody stupid. Each morning my dad got up at about 6 to try and get a sunbed with an umbrella. Of course they had all already gone! So in the end he gave up and got up at 8 instead to get one without a umbrella. We visited Palma, the main town of Majorca, but it was an hour and a hlaf bus journey from where we staying! grrr. Our hotel was very nice, it had a big swimming pool, stage area, tennis courts, football courts, lots of shops, a burger bar, a pizzeria, a park, a volleyball bit and lots of bars. Also it was so close to the beach it took you about a minute to get onto the beach if you got out of the swimming pool! Erm... Didn't really meet anyone which was a bit annoying, but it didnt bother me too much as i was never bored. The simming pool had a slide! YAY I got my hair done again like last year. And the good thing was that it was 20 euros cheeper! Plus there were trampolines outside of the complex up the road so i was happy! I think i spent to much money on them though. well thats all i cant hink of to write at the mo so if u wat more details talk to me

       Cooooool, good for you Nicki! Very amusing picture Tom, you make me feel like an adolescent alocoholic. Ha ha, but it's only a bit of fun! OOoh still got to pack camera. Must remember that. Camera. Camera. Camera. Right! Um. Well work today was ok as per usual, nothing really exciting happened, and I didn't even get to do the trolley again (having been so chuffed with myself last week). But it was ok. Got a couple of good books from the library to take to Asutria, including George Orwell's "Animal Farm" which I hear is a historic read. Other than my toilteries and my lunch, I all set to go tomorrow! Should be fun, but I'm not really looking forward to a 24 hour coach journey now I know what it's like (havign done it for Prague). Well I sholud go cos I haven't got much else to say, I won't be back to next Monday probably. Then on the friday, I'm off again! yay! So have a good week y'all, and chat to ya when i get back (apart from Tom who is on the same trip, duh). Byeeeeeee guys! Oh Jackie hope you had a good holiday, tell me all about it when I get bcack!

       Wahey!  3500+ military vehicles on display, tanks, jeeps, ferrets, champs, weapons, explosions, living history reenactors, huge arena events, 1940s fashion, 1000+ stalls, world war two memorabilia, military models, 1940s history, fun fair and more!  Yesterday I rode on a tank, 5 which seems alot for a short ride but its well worth it! I have developed a new liking for tanks now. And Hummers. I love Hummers now. Hummers are basically like the jeep just ALOT bigger. You can see them in Black Hawk Down. This year they had a Iraqi tank there which drew a lot of interest. People come from all over to see the show, Dutch, French (pah!), German, even American! One day i hope to be involved somehow, maybe with my own vechiles. I wouldn't mind owning a  urlLink jeep  or  urlLink hummer  (big ol beasts!) when I'm older. Maybe ever a half track! Now  urlLink half tracks  really are nifty little things.

       Well well well. O to be an army brat hey? Spent the day at the War & Peace Show. Going again today. Got some 2 used combats, 2 for 10, not bad and today I will hopefully get the camo jacket to go with it (5) so I'm happy. I got to ride on a tank yesterday which was so much fun. The track was all bumpy and dirty and we were whizzing along I tells ya! That was my second tank ride so far, its worth it. I am eyeing up a job with tanks, the great beasts of a armored vechile!  Jackie comes back today or tomorrow. Not sure which but I'll be soooooooo happy when she comes on msn. I'll be all grinning and cheering.

       Hello guys. Long time no blog, etc etc. Well. Today Paul came round and we watched a film and then stuff, ya know?! Without wanting to go into too much detail, just letting you know what I'e done today. Seems the Great British summer is over all ready, it's been overcast, raining and windy all day, but I can see just an ickle bit of blue sky over there now?!  Oh no, just disappeared beind that big 'orrible cloud again. Ah well, we'll have to see what tomorrow brings I guess. um.  Tomorrow I am working from 12.30 till 4.30 which will get me some extra dosh, then working the usual hours on Saturday. Then Sunday- I'm off to Austria!!!! Yahooooooooooooo! I'm trying to pack at the moment but I'm having a bit of a crisis cos I can't find my little black vest top anywhere! Where the hell is it? I've turned my room, my sisters' rooms a=nd the bathroom upside down, still no sign of it!  I can't go without it! Other than that, I think I'm decided on what CDs to take, what clothes to take, I definetly need a hair drier, Thais bites and dried fruit, then after that I will bung in as many more clothes that will possibly fit! he he. Clarinet is not going in suitcase this year, I will just shove it in the hold on the coach, seeings as last time I wasted precious suitcase space by trying to get it in! Was so devestated when I found out I could have left it out and taken more clothes! Anywho, that is about it. My top 5 CDs for the trip are going to be "Jagged Little Pill" by Alanis Morisette, "New Jersey" and "Cross Roads" by Bon Jovi, "Idol Hits" by Billy Idol and "Meatloaf and friends" by various artists (duh). Top beauty product: Nail file. Best holiday book: yet to find it! Ah that reminds me- got to go and get one!!!

       I don't see the point in Sky subscriptions etc. It'll be shown on the BBC or somthing soon anyway. When I move house, i'm going to cancel the liscence subscription, I hardly watch any TV.  Lee and I have made our own office in Warlingham school! yay! Its a bit like the server room, only more organised. Currently Lee is making his custom made "Compaq" and I am writing this.  Ta-raa

       Ahhh, packing for holidays. Finding out how much of your walldrobe you can fit in your bag. Deciding which music to take, removing the ones you probably won't listen to, then put the whole lot in. Making lists of everything you are going to forget, and then forgetting it. Ah the joys.

       Cool, sounds wicked Nicki! How long is it for, and when?! Well, I've got four whole days left until I set off to Austria, which should be fun! howvere, I'm not looking forward to the concert side of things, a) because I am veyr unsure of the words in some songs (ummm!) and b) because I am apparently 'middle alto' so I have a little part all to myself (oh and Sally and the girl who can't sing), I can't hear either of them, my sister has deserted me, I didn't know I was supposed to be singing it until Friday, and um, I can't do it! Other than that it shoudl be fine. Oh apart from the small matter of Chango Mangos which I can't do either, me and bloody volunteering for solos. Ah yes, news flash: David T blatanly fancies Louise. PERVERT! Will explain when I see people; " just wanted to let you know your sister sang a solo, she was the better than everybody else there and I coludn't believe it was her". We all know what you're like David.......

We were all laughing and chatting and I am really looking forward to go-karting with them all on Sunday. We also learnt that for our trip to and fro Cumbria we have a  l u x o r y  coach! Woooo!

       Well I had a fun day at work, met the lady who has been on maternity leave, was quite interesting actually. Alpa has had a baby called Shey, and was covering for Tatuna today so she could take her kids out for the day (btw Tatuna is Tina's real name, I can see why she shortens it to Tina instead of Tuna). We got a lot of work done, and had a laugh at Alpa who couldn't remember a thing after 3 months off and swore quite a lot!!! Anyways! Tom has just accepted to do my job while i#'m on holiday, which proably means he'll get to meet Kinnou and Kishan, although kishan won't speak to anyone anyway, kinnou just throws herslef at random strangers!  Anywho, yes. hot day,. Lovelly. Got a headache. Marvellous. Fun. Mystery tour 14th September. Yay. Whaey. Must go. Alcohol. bye

       We need Jackie. She keeps everyone talking or rather posting. Plus her posts can be rather amusing. I miss Jackie.  Well, right then. Wednesday. Tom and I went on up to London and he has already said what we did. The guns you can move were great fun. My arms are all muscly now, lol. Well we kept pointing them at on coming boats and then following them as they went by which was great fun. It was great being a kiddie again. Hehe. The musems were interesting, well, what we saw. I think they will have to be made into proper day outs then we can actually do all the exhibits. Oh yea - Bow, stern, starboard and port. WAHEY! It wasn't that bad wandering around trying to find the photo shop. It was worth it. Its cute. hehe. And the lady was really nice. I liked her. Yay. So yesterday I did sod all. Today I went shopping in Bromly with my sister. Got some cheap clothes in the sales. Wahey! I have alos just figured out how to make my own CD!!!!! So far I have made a 'Rock On!! A Nikko Production.' album. Over the coming weeks I will make a party album and 'Nikko's Greatest Love Songs'. If you want copies you will have to give me a CD and I will make one. Hehe.  Um, what else. Max BLOG.  Park on Sunday should be good. Nic and Jen will be joining us for once. Wahey. One last note, you know you got a willing slave you just like to play the thought that you might misbehave but since I'm only dead to you I'm saying stay away. Get it?

       I haven't blogged for a while, so two days worth of blogging!  On  Wednesday  I dragged Nicki all the way round London.  In this order, or some variation of it, we... Went to the HMS Belfast and looked around that for a couple of hours. The coolest bit has to be these massive guns that you can move around and point at stuff, so we threatened boats on the river. I'm sure Nicki has some cool things to say about the boat. It really was pretty amazing. Nicki now knows all the parts of the boat, and what the different flags are called, hehe. Then we wondered down towards South Bank along the river side, up to the Tate Modern. Didn't go in, but just had a quick look. Then we got the tube all the way over to South Kensington (near Hyde Park) and had lunch in my favourite resturant. Then we looked around the Natural History Museum (the Life and Earth sections). Followed by a quick tour of the Science Museum. Then we went back into the city to Westminster and went to "the door" featured in Die Another Day the Bond movie. It's the one on the other side of the river to the Houses or Parilment where Bond goes to meet M in the underground station. Then we bought a ticket for a boat back to South Bank, but while we were waiting we went up to the London Eye to have a look. 5! Not bad, do that one day. Then we bought ice creams and went to watch protesters in Parliment Square. They where campaigning for the legalisation of canabis. One blokes sign said "Free the Weed". Then we had a lovely boat trip up the Thames to South Bank, where we went up into Farringdon where I got us lost for a few minutes looking for this tiny little photography shop. I found it in the end, although Nicki wasn't too impressed. How was I supose to know there where two post offices? Anyway, we went in there, and because I had rung the lady in the shop up asking how to get there, and after telling her our little story she gave us some free postcards. Then we joined the rest of London and got a train home.  Today  I did nothing.

       Well I really enjoyed PITP. It was a great day out minus those cheesy feet and the fact that I too got burnt. But once I got home I slapped on lots of after sun. The train on the way back was funny. LOL. All together now - hehe. Good laughs. Good memories and good memories is what is imporant.  I went to Ash's house last night and we spent 8 hours on the Nintendo playing Bomberman and stuff. Then we watched 4 films one of which was Not Another Teen Movie which is one of the funniest movies ever. It was a good laugh. I have now seen the Ali G film, I wasn't that impressed I have to say. Dirty Danicng is always good to watch and so is The Sixth Sense. So I went down the park today. I was not impressed. I got down there and no one was to be seen so I rang Helen and she said they were in the woods and she would come a find me in a mo seeing as I didn't know where they were. So I sat there and waited. And waited. No one came. So I rang / text again and I was told to 'come and find us, its a game' to which my reply came as 'no, I am not in the mood to piss about'. Still I waited. And you know what I am like when people ignore me or leave me alone so I walked back up the Dobbins and headed home. I met Lora on the way so I turned around and went back as it was a relatively nice day. Sure enough as Lora was there they came out and we sat around all day. Which I didn't mind seeing as I was / am tired. Oh, and its fun to the be the butt of everyones jokes and jibes. Thanks a lot. I miss Jackie.

       What really worried me was the fact that Pingu was the one suggesting I used voodoo. I'm not quite sure who is going to the park and who is not, all I know is that I'm not, partly because I'm sitting here. I know Nicki isn't going, and Jackie can't go for geography reasons. Jo is in school. So it's probably just Max then.

       What the............................? Random comments! Random comments! Anyway, I had a VERY interesting conversation last night, won't go into details but involved mu Pingu, and Tom mblatantly didn't like the fact that Pingu is getting more action than him cos Tom says he's going to put Pingu and  Tony Blair in a box together and practice Voodoo on them, which is a bit unfair for me, although I woulnd't care if he blew Tony Blair up, I wolud be veyr upset if he practiced Voodoo on my Pingu, so STAY OUTTA IT! Anyways enough of that, I'm going up to school later and I think I shall wear my very mini skirt, which means I need to go and paint my toe nails! Yay papmering time! yay! Anyways see y'all later dudes. Apart from Jackie who is on holiday. Bye!

          Replace cabage for something that sounds alike to froging   Which cabage idiot put cabage Heathrow airport all the cabage way over there?  Take an age to get from cabage Victoria to cabage Heathrow. Probably worth going all the cabage way to cabage Paddington and then paying another cabage 12 to get the cabage express all the way over cabage there. Just move cabage Heathrow into the middle of cabage London, job cabage done. Planes will probably get the caught in the cabage congestion zone and get charged a cabage fiver, and a couple of cabage speeding tickets. "Excuse me British Airways, but your vehicle was doing 350km/h" cabage Ken would probably say. Stupid cabage country.

       So you enjoyed it then Tom? I wasn't sure whether you were going to l ike it or not (seeings as u are a Moby fan etc etc), but I think you enjoyed it? PErhaps not quite so much as Bon Jovi, but after such a wicked concert anything would be hard to follow! And Nicki, I had a fab day with yo u and Helen and Tom, was a good group to go with, and I have a big bruise on my back from when u knocked me over taking my shoe off! But I had fun. Meatloaf was really good, I can live happily ever after now I've seen him do the full version of "Bat out of Hell" live, I felt a bit lonely tho cos nobody else knew all the words (well, apart form the old fogies!) but hey, I had fUN! I am very burnt though, and it is rather painful. My back is all prickly and so are my shoulders, and my face is quite a strange pinkish colour! Not a good look, especailly when wearing a red t-shirt, but I suppose it's my own fault really. Anyway! Yay! Probably come back alter.

       I think Nicki is tired. Late last night I finished setting up wireless internet in my house. We can now access the internet from any room in the house, and even the garden. Study in quiet rooms, get latestest sport results while cooking and many other things - but does my mother do something that sensbile? No, of course not. "Wireless internet? Does that mean I can play computer games in bed?" Mothers hey? Tut tut. Blog more later, she's just got onto Level 2 of Lego "Stack It"...

       OK, so the times SHOULD be fixed now. Lol. I take it Max you cannot sleep still? Aww. How lovely. I have already send 6 texts this morning and it is only 10.15. Mwahahaha. I am so tired from Thorpe Park though. I really am. But I really enjoyed it. Simon is a wimp. Haha. I am tired. At least I won't be bored over the next 2 weeks as Jackie is very kindly giving me her dance mat while she is away. O how I love Jackie. I am tired. The park tomorrow better be fun or I just won't bother so someone better come and mess about and not just sit there for the whoooooole four hours. I am tired. O look, I just looked at my msn list and 6 people are online but I didn't even notice because my brain won't function properly today. I am tired. My cats are so funny. One is asleep in the chair and one is in a box. How cute. I am tired.

       The time should be fixed - I hope. Today was fun (Thorpe Park with Jackie, Ben and Si). I really enjoyed it. It was a good laugh and the queues weren't too long. We got on Nemisis a few times which was nice.

       Why Jackie? I am majorly peed off. I only went and broke my clarinmet mouth piece right at the beginning of a rehersal. And it smashed completely, in a total freak accident. It's not insured. And I can't afford to buy anohter one. So eally I'm buggered.

I'm afraid I can't come to the park at all on Friday Nicki cos I'm working from 12 till 4, then going up to school for a rehersal, so it'll have to be some other time! Howvere we are gonna b in the park sometime on thursday so if you lot are around then we might bump into you! Who knows?! Anyway, got to go get ready for a rehersal a t cshool and find my BonJOvi t-shirt to wear! yay!

       Sounds good! I am glad ya'll had fun! Can't wait to see pictures, may we put them on DNP? Any Jo, if you come to the park on Friday bring Paul so he can meet everyone else and we can meet him! A friend is coming over today and we are having Keanu Film Day. Hehe. Should be a laugh. What can I ramble about? Um, well I am watcing Laurel and Hardy and they are really funny. I have already today text Sikon (at 12.08) gone to bed, got up, showered, eaten and cleaned my room. I am now posting here and surfing the web until 11 when I shall meet my friend. It should be a good laugh today/ I haven't watched the Matrix on our big tele yet.

       I do say stuff, but i never do anything exciting or out of the ordinary so i have nothing to write, but i try and write something every day so people know that im alive and that i havent dropped dead! Okay so lemme think of some news.... Well on www.faceparty.com/crisppy i am officially rated a supermodel now! I have been a star for the past like year! So im really really happy although i dont like being a supermodel that much! On Monday i am going to Croydon to get some passport photos done for stupid school, although i have no one to go with, that doesnt bother me though as im only getting the photos done then going home again! It's a bit of a trip but there aint any photo machines around where i live! Then tuesday im enroling and then after that i should be going to the cinema with Nicki to see Hollywood Homicide, that should be good but i do hope that Nicki doesnt talk too much or i may have to beat her with a wooden stick. On wednesday i have a frigging hospital appointment and then Thursday it's back to the dreadding school. ERm thats about it really! Thats my life all written down in one paragraph! :( lol

       You don't say much, do you Jackie? Today at work Trig brought with him his fly swatting gun, like Andy has. He then turned into James Bond and bounced around the centre swatting flies and scaring children. I came across a fake pound coin today! Never seen one before, and the customer hadn't either, he was quite suprised! Other than Garf and Biscuit's attempt at wearing womens jackets and Alex wearing winter-wet-suits it was a pretty normal day, or as normal as it can get.

       Rah. I work for Tina atm but I think it is Alpa's husband that owns the shop, so what Alpa's baby Shay is old enough she will come back to work at the shop and share Saturday with Tina. Shrina and Shay are Alpa's kids, Kinnou and Kishan are Tina's kids, Kommel is Tina's niece and Bimmel is Tina's husband. I'm going to see Hollywood homicide t his avo with Paul! Yay! WE're going to the 5.40 viewing, just in case other people are thinking of coming today (probably not) but in case you do, I'll be there with Paul!

       Rah. Ii got introduced into the crAzy world of Shrina today. Shrina is 6 (apparently, after her telling me that she was 5, 8, 9, 73, 26, 16 et et etc.......) and Shay is 5 months today. Shay behaves 10 times better t han Shrina, plus there is the added benefit that Shay can't talk yet, doesn't make you do strange dances, doesn't try and make u sing, doesn't push you into the window while you're trying to do a display, doesn't climb up ladders.................

       Brighton yesterday was fabulas. Ema and I had a great time and I managed to find a new pair of baggy surf jeans so yay! Day before I went to Croydon with mum to get stationary. We were just outside the bag shop on the second floor and Pennie came over, with her mum. And then Tom joined us, with his mum! Heehee. How fabulas. I got some pictures from Andy's party which are amusing.

       Nicki, you really need to get out more. Jackie, there is a part-time position being advertised in the window of Lloyds chemist in Hamsey Green- I think that means you do after school work and the odd Saturday or something, just thought I'd tell ya! Anywho, I haven't got much to do today, meeting Paul later this afternoon and he's coming here for  the evening. Other than that trying to get a bit of work done, but not getting very far.

       A tree toad loved a she-toad Who lived up in a tree. He was a two-toed tree toad But a three-toed toad was she. The two-toed tree toad tried to win The three-toed she-toad's heart, For the two-toed tree toad loved the ground That the three-toed tree toad trod. But the two-toed tree toad tried in vain. He couldn't please her whim. From her tree toad bower With her three-toed power The she-toad vetoed him.

       Evening. Great party last nite. (Of what I can remember). Sorry Tom, I couldnt do PWD on flashkit.com, I had sorta calmed down by the end of the night. I didnt throw up *cackle*. I didnt get one wink of sleep last night, and I did feel sick at about 6:30, so I took a Rennie in a desperate attempt to stop the sickness. It worked.

       Well yesterday I went to a party with some friends from Riddlesdown, but there defenition of party is more 'piss-up' than party. But anyway, it's really funny watching all theboys who get completely trashed then dance around madly to Electric Six and Led Zepplin. Extremely funny. I left about 11pm, but everybody else 'crashed' on the floor at Bennett's house over night, havign done a midnight raid on Tesco's with  "a spot of bush jumping", as Paul so delightfully put it. Anywho. Today I've been to Caterham and the library and stuff, got a supply of alchohol for Thursday (good or bad!), and got this wicked album out the library: "Ether Song" by Turin' Brakes, it's great! Also just discovering The Thrills and The Vines, they're pretty good tooooooooo! Thursday is drawing ever closer, trying to fill up my time to forget about it! I think I might take a trip into crodyon tomorrow to go to Beano's and get some more music, wander a bit, then I'm going to the cinema in the evening with Paul to see 'Pirates of the Carribean'. Yay! Tonight I am going out to a friend's house for a catch up, so no thinking about GCSEs! yay! Hmmmmmm! Just heard that Andy's party is hawaiin themed, so better go think about that one! ttyl guys!

       I went to Ikea today. My mother and I. I can not believe how long we waited for the stuff. All the larger stuff like wardrobes (what we were buying) has to be got for you via fork-lift-truck in the warehouse. 45 minutes we had to wait. 45 MINUTES! We left our trolleys, nothing had been paid for yet so we weren't worried, got in the car and went to Sainsburys. Got some food and a paper, went back, had a look at the art and pictures (I bought a picture of a rubber duck!) and then went back to the warehouse, read the paper for a few minutes and then finaly the stuff was given out. Not going back there for a while, at least a month.

        Welcome back Jo  I'd love to hear all about your holiday if you want to tell me about it. Yes thank you, I had a great time Cumbria. Thank you for remembering :) I'm not looking forward to Thursday either, I don't think our group is meeting up but I am sure we will all merge together when we are at the school. I haven't heard of any dinners or parties, or I haven't been invited. Guess I brought that on myself by not turning up to Daz's bbq. Oh my. How could I. I'm sorry but I am rather annoyed. People are a bit mad at me for not going. Fair enough. But how come its me they are mad at? How come when other people do the same thing its fine!? No getting annoyed at that person or whatever, just me. Grrr. I just can'tget it right can I? Perhaps I should disappear off the face of the earth and then perhaps people may miss me. Or maybe they will start to spread blame out rather than focus it on one person.  I understand that perhaps I have annoyed folk by talking about James, Jon, Leon and Ema alot but that is because  1) they are new and the novelty hasn't worn off yet 2) they don't place blame on me Its not everyone, only a few. But those few make me go all urgh and then I guess it can affect the ones who I love. If that makes sense. Yes I am in a badish mood. Why? Because my gorgeous new fabulas skate shoes decided that today when I walked up to Warlingham they were going to rip half the skin off my ankle which is not pleasant. I have also been shouted at 6 times today for the smallest things. So excuse me for having a moan.

       Hi guys! I'm back! Nice to know tom missed me, ha ha! Anyway! Did y ahave a good time Nicki? I should probbably read all the blogs that I've missed, but to be honest I'm too tired to faff around with it! Holiday was great, I'll tell you all individually if ya want to know instead of boring all of you who don't want to know, but the basis was it was great, 40 degrees everyday, blah blah! Yeah. Um. I'm not really looking forward to Thursday (obviuosly), but I am in the aspect that we get to see all our friends together again, various people have organised parties and dinners and stuff which should be good! I was wondering if our gang are meeting up somewhere and all going up to school together, or whether that will be too stressful for some people? Let me know if anyone has, and I shall be there! Well got to go, mein vater is cooking me an omlete! Tah tah!"

       Fair enough Tom. I always miss everyone when they are on holiday, the funny thing is no one misses me! Weather they are on holiday or if I am. I can prove that by the large number of people who had forgotten that I had been away for that week. How..demoralising. Made me feel great. Ok Jackie, I will see you there then. I am wandering to the park today to see Ema, James was coming but he can't now as he is getting as level results and so has to go home to tell his Aunt and Uncle. I miss Ema, I was on the phone to her for ages last night! Twas rather amusing.

       Interesting link there Tom. Thans for that. I certainly had a good old chuckle. Yer, Daz is very lucky with that. I think I can come to the BBQ but only for a couple hours as it is A-level day so I tink have to be home for dinner or something. I dunno. I'll see. Jackie, perhaps I can come to your house first or knock for you as I go up to Darrens? Or will you be there early to help him set up? My next few days are as follows: Tomorrow: A-Level result day so going to park to meet James to find out what he got at AS Level. Then Daz's bbq. Friday: Can't remember. Probably nothing. Saturday: Nowt. Sunday: Nowt.  Wooooooooooo!

       Well, i have been round Darens house all day helping him out in garden ready for his BBQ, i even helped to clean his room! He has sooooo much Alcohol! And his mum payed for it all! She is even paying for food and stuff as well! He is sooo lucky in that respect. I think we may be going to see T3 on Friday but i'm not sure, i will have to ask Max when i next speak to him. I hope we do, but if we don't i will ak Darren to go with me instead just the 2 of us, cause we have wanted to see it for ages! Tsk Tsk, you computer could be seriously ill Nicki! Make sure you take it to the Healthcheck at PC World or you could be in serious trouble! lol I am so glad that the heat is finally leaving us, its an acceptable heat now, i can sleep at night now without sweating the bed down! Lol, Has anyone got ne thing planned for the rest of the week? And Tom heres a virtual hug from me also! :D  Make sure you get another one from me off MSN.

       I am back. Yay. Our norton was corrupted and blocked us from accessing everything but it works again now. Although if I disappear for a while its probably because my computer is sick. We haven't taken it in for its yearly healthcheck at PCWorld like we are supposed to. Oops.  Sorry, I thought you saw T3 on Monday when I did, just earlier. I saw it in the evening. Yes, shocking, I was in Croydon at 8pm! OMG! But Leon, Ema and James waited with me until I got on the bus which was nice. Like I said, I like having people all protective over me. Its nice.  Awww Tom. Have a virtual hug. I know, life is a bitch sometimes and its not fair when people are taken from us. I don't know to say that can help except that I have you in my thoughts.

       Well my foot still hurts, and after tomorrows little trip I'm going to be flat broke. My spots are not being nice, I look like a bloody lepoard or something. Nothing I do helps! I take tablets, I apply funny strange blue liquid after washing, I wipe clean with those pad thingys when ever I come home, but fuck it! Nothing seems to work! I'm being selfish perhaps? Maybe I am, probably am, after all I'm selfish know-it-all twat, arn't I? I think I know everything and I never shut up, do I? Well you're going to put up with me for the next minute or two. Why should I have nice clear skin like everybody else? I don't need to be like everybody else, I'm not a bloody sheep or something. Yep, that's it, I'm a selfish bugger and proud of it. I want clear skin, I want this, and I want that. All me, me, me, me. Is it really so hard!?!? Bullshit there is some all mighty god or what ever the hell people believe in. If there was, stuff like this wouldn't happen. Victor, who is my great-grand-cousin (long title, but he's close), has been ill for a last month and has just passed away in hospital. He was such a nice person, had a lovely family who are now spread all over Europe (6 children!), and he wasn't even that old. Can't believe it, and I don't want to believe it. How can somebody so nice die? Much rather the people who broke into my neighbors house and stole their car died, that would be much nicer. Bastards, they should be shot. Makes me so angry that people think they can get away with it. People so desperate and stupid that they have to resort to crime to get them out of their problems. Go to hell the lot of 'em. So I'm selfish for wanting my family to live as well maybe? I want him back, I want to say goodbye. Is that selfish as well? It's not you, it's me. Ah, fuck it, it's all pointless anyway...

Its ok, I didn't like it all that much though. Camden yesterday was cool, I have never been before and I know I will be going there alot more often now. Hehe. I got a sum 41 hoodie for the winter. I like hoodies. They are so nice and waaaarm. I met Jon's twin yesterday. I really do look alike! I got a bit confuzzeled! I hope you are feeling better Tom and that the pain goes away soon!

       Awww bless yaz Tom. Well the park today shall be amusing what with the heat and poor air quality. I have a feeling it will be a case of just sitting there. I can't be assed to bring a rug today, takes too much effort carrying it up/down the hill.  I'm out tomorrow in London with my darlings. Hehe. Can't wait to see them all again. Even though I saw James yesterday. Argh. My brain can't handle the smog!

I can take in the broom trolley without it going on the road. Tomorrow I'm doing my job (doing the afternoon shift, thank goodness). So I'm very tired, but I've just had a Reef on an empty stomach and seeing things in a new light, hehehe. Beep.

I may come down an hour or two latebecause I don't fancy wandering about at midday when its at its hottest. Hmm. I will decide tonight. Tom, you should be very impressed with me.

       You're not wrong Nicki, in America, it's the same movie, but it is rated R (people 17 and under require a parent or guadian to be present) because US censorship it rubbish. You can't show anything over there.

       Dammit Jackie! Why must you bring that up! LOL. Yer, good luck to you to. I am wetting myself about it. I think I will go up before 11 and be ready to get my results the moment they open up. I will then jump on my envelope, run home, open it, and cry. Yup. That's my plan. Nice pic of Nic Max. I don't think she'd be too impressed. Yesterday I had one of my group meetings, it was great. Lovely to see everyone again. Today is our last meeting so I am not too pleased but I am happy because Ema has invited me to a party and James and I have spoken on the phone for nearly 2 hours every night so far since we have been back. They love me! LOL.  I am in a bit of dilemma but that is something to be spoken about quietly.    HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY JENNY

       Have fun Jo! The Lake District is so much fun and camping up there is even better :) I am sure you will have a great time. I did when I went. Yes, the film was excellent, I too would like a sequal and I would like to be a vampire. I already have the eyes. Mwhahaha. 3 weeks at Sixth Form. Good bad? I'd say good. Its going well for me. I am really knackered this week from sixth form and work. Whenever I stay up late doing homework or something I have to get up early and never get a chance for a lay in. Right now I am aching so bad. :(  Have a nice weekend everyone.

       Well. What an interesting day. Had to take half my personal belongings into school today to pack into a barrell for D of E, and I just know I'm going to have forgotten to pack something really crucial. As it is I've forgotten plates and cuttlery (quite important!), so i'm gonna have to sit on it tomorrow in the mini-bus. So yes. I just hope that a) it doesn't rain, and b) it doesn't get too bloody cold!!! I think that the cold is going to be the worst bit, having to camp for 3 nights in the freezing cold lake district, with nothing but 5 layers of clothes, a sleeping bag and a lilo for warmth. Hey ho, gotta do these thigns to get places in this world, I guess! Sholud be a laugh though, I just can't help feeling a bit nervous cos we've got to capsize in the lake, and I hate deep water. However, we do get life jackets so it sholudn't be too scary................But I bet I end up in tears whatever happens! Hey ho, so gutys have a good weekend, be back on Tuesday!

       I wil be at school until 5 tomorrow to go through my geology report with Scott and Seward. I have a full day tomorrow, no frees. Dammit. I enjoyed the chat Jackie, Sally, Matt and I had fourth lesson. It was just plain cute I reckons. Today was ok. Lessons were good. Art was hilarious as we had to draw ourselves with a continuous line without looking which was incredibly amusing. It rained! Wahoo! My cous sent some pictures of him and his wife from this wedding then went to. It was in Montanna and the pics are so nice. I'm happy. I'm content with my life. Its fine.

BUSTED were so awesome. I love BUSTED. I would go see them next year at Wembley but tickets are like 21.50 which is a bit stepp so I will just enter lots of competitions and see if I get in there that way, cos BUSTED are worth it. Oh the park. Yer. Haven't spoken to them yet. Who went in the end do we know? Yer so BUSTED were great and I love Matt Jay now, aka, MATTIE. Phor. Wahey. Start work tomorrow. Don't know when I am working yet so I don't want any of ya'll coming in trying to harass me on my first day. But you can come in to say hi if you wish. LOL.

       1)Maths cos I really enjoy it atm and it's interesting 2) Geography- I'm dropping it! yay!  3) Having so much freedom and being able to get involved in what I want, when I want! 4) Haven't come across it yet!    So yeah. Today has been one whirl-wind of a day, in all aspects. Busy, busy, what with Ofsted Inspectors lurking in corridors and stuff, plus I am trying to work out with my head of 6th form what to take up instead of geography, or whether to bother at all, so I've just phoned about 20 different unis to ask their advice, and I got to go and have a meeting with Mr Butterworth tomorrow morning to dicuss more.

       1) Um, kinda a mix of ICT and AVCE Business, they all have their good points. 2) Same again, except they have bad points. 3) Best thing.....free lessons!!! 4) Free lessons get boring...  WHO BROKE THAT BLOODY HI-FI IN THE COMMON ROOM! Sorry, im in the LRC right now and its boiling hot in here, maybe it because ive got a fleece on :D My parents are going away for three days on Tuesday! Whooo!!!

       my best subject is erm PE but thats only cause i get to do practicales! Worst lesson i sprobably psychology cause ms Ajit is a stupid woman who continually writes stuff on the borad and it gets kinda boring after like 10 mins! I woul agree with nicki bout the free periods but only cause u can laugh at peeps in lessons! i am quite anoyed that i only got 8 frees now rather than the 14 i started with! lol Worst thing bout 6th form is the ammount of work you get, i think it is unbeleivable you get sooooooo much. And if you have more than one teacher its even worse! Ahhhhhh help me with my homework i have like 6 peices to do and i am getting bored of it already! Well what colour do you guys reakon i should paint my new room now my sister has gone? I need to know by tonite though so my daddy can get the paint! LOL I cant wait to get in this room permentantly cause that way i will have sooo much room and space i wont know wot to do with it all! But i know for a fact i wont let my room get into a mess like vanessa did! You could only see the floor on good days or after she had supposedly cleaned up! Lol  Shes gone now and it still looks a mess cause she has left half of her stuff her! The whole room is covered in dust cause we havent been able to get to any of the surfaces for at least 2 years!  Wow this is a really long blog for me im used to writing like 10 words then signing off maybe im writing sucha a long blog to stall me from doing my homework! Hehe And i have one more thing to moan about, Nickki have you noticed how all the chairs seem to be dissappearing over to the "upper 6th side" and less of them sit that side ne way! plus they have the new chairs over their side and the pool table! Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

       Ahhhhhhhh. Eat you aliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiive. Omg how annoying was that whole music argument earlier. I can't believe how rude the sixth form are, especially the upper sixth. They are supposed to be helping and welcoming us not attacking us!!!!! But anyway, we will get our way eventually. I had a goodish day today. Lessons were fine. Here is a small question thingy for everyone to do:  1) Best lesson/subject? Why? 2) Worst? 3) Best thing about Sixth Form? 4) Worst?  My anwsers: 1) Geology because we have such a laugh with Seward. For example I wore my top with the sticky letters and we wrote 'seward.com'. Then changed it to 'seward rocks' (get the joke there..geology...rocks) which was highly amusing. Then using seward rocks we were finding the anagrams of it. LOL.  2) Probably English with that lady teacher I have. Its boring. We all fall asleep. 3) Free periods. You can chill out in common room, go on computers, do work in libary, go to shops, do schol service. Its so cool because most others are in lessons. 4) The upper sixth being prats and not seeing people as much like Jackie.

       Congratulations Jo :)  I agree Jackie. I disagree with Max. I would say something to Sheepy by he hasn't blogged in a while. Lol. Well I came online last night at 11.10PM. Shocking. I had been doing art and textiles since 8pm so I wanted a break. After I came offline at about 11.45PM I did a couple spider diagrams and then went to be. Got up at 8 this morning, added some more detail to all my 4 spider diagrams and then came on here. In a mo I will go and do my geology and english lit (essay and book talk prep!!) and then go off to Woolies for my job interview. O the excitment. Then of course tomorrow I am going to the CBBC Prom In The Park with Jo, Tom and Nancy which should be a laugh. Then its back to school, week one, school service, lessons, mad lunches, free periods, general studies (pah!).

I have read everyones blog since my last but I won't comment on them all as I can't remember what they all said!!  So far I am finding Sixth Form mang! There are only one or two aspects I am not liking but thats mainly teachers I'm not keen on. I love all the new folk we have in our ickle group. Jenni, JAMES....lol. Hush. I am looking forward to the geology trip we are organising for half term. We get 2 days off school which means we also get to miss the sponsered walk!!! Yea!!!  September 11th. R.I.P.

       WEll i had a good day cept that it nded in my having four peices of homwork to do! BY TMOR! (i did leave 2 peices form yesterday to do today) Erm that phot thing is stupid and took age, my legs were acheing after that, and boy my picture is gonna look like shit! Erm i would like to say Miss Shar is usless, she talks on bout nothing so we dont get any of the info we are ment to get and we always end up walking out of the classroom with her still yabbering on bout nothing! I had four frigging lessons today, i think General studies is gonna be a load of bollocks, if id wanted to take 5 subjects i woulda done! No one said nothing bout doing general studies wen we applied did they! Grrrrrrrr What a bloddy waste of time! And not to mention energy, i do hope we dont get homeowrk for that cause i got enuf already, that probably being cause i got a bout 13 teachers and im only doing 3 subjects! Which means with every teacher i get homework, but fortuantly it means that it doesnt have to be in for ages cause i dont have then again for like a week! I now how 3 fat text books to carry to skool everyday and not to mention the 3 folders i also have to bring to skool with all my work in, by the end of the year im gona have no arms left cause they will of dropped off! Wahey this is a long blog for me, i think its cause im in a  oaning mood and im taking a break form teh 4th peice of homework of the nite! I'm not used to this, back in the good ole days of yr 11 i could leave it till the last minute and srill have to time to eat a cake! But not now as each peice takes like an hour or more to do! I Cant cope and im saying this after only  4 days at school! lol Im sure ill ajust to the lifestyle, it sounds better than urs Jo, you seen to have mountains of homwork and hardly ne free periods! Mine have gone done to 11 now cause of stu[id general studies! I would like to apoliguise for my poor spelling and grammar but i cant be bothered to check through it and make sure it makes sence! Hehe im lazy! Well thats bout it from me, im off to continue my Health and Social Care homework in which i have to read a newspaper and then rite about it and challenge its contents!

Throwing grapes at Tom and Dave, that was good as well. (It was Jenny.J who through the grape at Jenny - Tom I swear, lol!!!!). WHEY! only had 1 lesson today total, including the cancelled ICT lesson. SCHIZER. I havent done my ICT, maybe because I cant think of a project to do.

Well I've been working since I got home about 3.15 today, I literally finished 10 minutes ago, I've washed my hair, running a bath, going to dry my hair, then go online to chat to people until I feel that the time has come for me to retire to bed!  WEll today for homework I have had to write a piece on why Mussolini came to power, make notes on a chapter of geography on urbanisation, Research and do a piece on tides, learn the present tense in Spanish (regular an irregular), Do some french questions on a text then translate the whole of the text into English, 4 questions on Algorithms for Decision maths, and finally a whole exercise on manipulating surds (in the words of my teacher, "sounds vaguely obscene") for pure maths. Oh the joys! Well at least I am enjoying it atm!

       Good Jackie - you get to read a real newspaper rather than just rubbish about people who show off for a living, anyway... I'm tired. Way too much work. I can't believe it, a few years ago I stopped art, I thought that was the end of my colouring in days - but oh no, geography today, drawing maps. Green for land, blue for sea - logical you see. One step ahead of the game. Business & Economics as well, stuff about the shop Spar (private joke for Jo, SPPAAARRRRRRRRR!). More geography for the other one, Coombes. First media studies lesson today - very cool, looks like fun! Period 5 today quite a few people had a free and not many could be bothered to do any work at the end of the day, so sat in the common room. Tasha was having a conversation with Penny and Helen, and the whole room went quiet for some reason (you know what I mean, it just does) and all you could hear was Tasha saying "are we talking testicals?" Rather amusing I must say. Have you guys seen that stupid sign the upper sixth put up about us? First day in school and instantly we get blammed for the mess in the common room. No lower sixth went in the common room because they were all to scared of the upper sixth! Silly people. I think it's quite sweet the way the whole room has divided itself between upper and lower, straight down the middle. Poor Nicki still hasn't got her computer working yet, so she's probably reading this in school at lunch - hi Nicki!

Um yes. Well school is ok actually, I have a group of people I could call 'friends', probably more associates, but hey, I got to start somwhere. I'm still getting the 'oh let's all talk to the new girl and try to drag her into our clan' which isn't too bad, as everywhere I go people talk to me and yell hi across the corridors and stuff, which makes me feel liked so all's good atm.

       Food for poor ol' me as well!!!!! Yesterday was absolutely great. Not only did I get 30 for doing 5 mins maintenance/repair on someones PC, but I had a great night out too! Can't get any better than that. As my wallet has been 'topped-up' *smug* I can now afford my Only Fools And Horses DVD, Max Payne II (when it comes out in about a month) and I can also take Nic out for a classy meal when I get round to it one weekend. Corny. I have also done most of my homework so far. I'm hardly lagging which gets me in a happier mood :) P.S: BRAND new absolutemaxpayne.co.uk due for release in about 3 weeks (just before release, how convenient). Kinky.

       Oh dear. As some of you know I went to the BFI London IMAX cinema yesterday with Dave, Andy and Max to see The Matrix Reloaded. The movie was great! But, rather than finishing at about 9pm like we thought it would, it finished at 11pm. So after getting out of the cinema, into the station, getting some food for poor Andy, finding a train, then hanging around at Clapham Junction for 20 minutes to get to East Croydon I got home pretty close to 1am. If I fall asleep in the common room, just poke me or something.

       Well done Jackie. Can't believe the little amount of frees you have Jo. I have 14 I think. In fact period one tomorrow is free. Yay, Monday morning and I can sleep for an hour in the common room! I was not impressed on Friday. My Eng Lit lesson was crap, I nearly fell asleep. Its one of those teachers who talks in the same flat tones. AAAAAAH! Then I had a free so I did some school service. Then I had textiles which at the moment I hate. The teacher was treating uslike year 7's, don't talk when I am, don't talk you should be doing your work etc... She also said that when we bring in fabric we HAVE to share it, like if someone asks to use some of yours you give it to them. Nope. I'm not. I don't have much money so anything I buy I am using myself, they can go buy it themselves. I mean for textiles and art so far its already cost me 10 for the 4 sketch books. Outrageous. I don't see why I should supply the rest of the class with fabric.  Anyways, I still have one more piece of textiles to do so chal.

       Rah well would blog but I've got so much to do it's ridiculous- Geography research (what and as much as I want to do for general background info), history research on publish health in the 1750s, Spanish stuff (the easiest of the lot- learning numbers!), French essays to write on the summer holidays- yay! Hey ho, at least I'm enjoying school and I am making friends, I've even been invited to someone's birthday party- and she's only invited 25 people. I guess it's out of pity for the poor new girl, but hey! Who am I to complain?!! Got to get my costume sorted for that, but she's gonna tell me what the theme is on monday. Shoudl be interesting........ My other bit of news is that I'm going to audition for Cabaret with Chloe on Monday night! That should be an absolute hoot. I can't remember whether I said that yesterday or not, but tbh I am so tired I really can't remmeber! hey ho. Got all my files sorted, so I'm ready to be off Monday morning and straight into a full week! Fortunately I only have to carry a daily file as we're not allowed to take in our whole file for each subject, in case we lose it somewhere and then we'll basically fail our AS levels wihtout the notes, apparently. Anyway! That's about it for today, I shall give u an update as to whether I am going on the Gold D of E canoeing expedition in a few weeks time when I find out on Monday- Holly and I are going to bribe the leader into letting me join in!

       Glad you had a good day Jo and that you are making friends :) I agree with Jackie, wasn't worth 20, maybe 10 but not 20. I enjoyed yesterday, I thought that the purpose of it all did work. I know my form seem a lot more relaxed with each other. My tutor is Miss Wilkins. Great. I have in my form who I know and get along with well, Olly, Max, Matt (can't remember his second name) and Lee Reeves. Then there are Michelle and Lisa who obviously I know and all. It should be okay. I also have Charlie in my form and he is a good laugh so should work out fine. I can't see how the Sixth Form block will work at lunch what with the lower and upper sixth all in at once. That's gonna be crazy. New guy James, was a bit lost at lunch as he couldn't find people so I told him to come on over and eat with us. Then Tom took him and the new girl Jenny off to the shops. Bless them. Bless Tom.

       Today I had tutor this morning where some interesting discussions took place between a girl called Chloe and I- she was telling me all about her day at the REAding festival, each band that played in the main arena, which guys she fancies from various punk/rock bands, and all abotu her favourite george Orwell novels, aparently the best she has read was a crime solving thing from the point of view of a cat....... Anyway, she was quite cool and I ended up on duty with her at break time, guarding the main hall from little kiddies trying to vandalise anythign and everything. Turns out she doesn't like anyone else in our tutor group either, so I tink it's a safe bet that i'll be spending a lot of time with her in tutor activities. After lunch I had a geography lesson which was a bit boring but also quite bizarre- the teacher sat us down and explained the usual boring stuff, then said "here's the book cupboard, here's some paper, do something with it" and we were all kind like, 'uh???!' but then she said she wanted us to write notes around the subject of coast lines, ready for our field work trip which is like 4 weeks time! argh! That's then going to be our coursework which has to be done by 5th Novemeber, so it's all getting quite scary already! I also made a sort of buddy in geography called Amy, we shared the books around and helped each other out by swapping notes! how sad am I? I'm jsut desperate to make friends I guess! Anywho, last thing I had french and that was quite funny actually,the teacher I had today is like Mrs Mawer (Jackie will know!), but and english version and slightly less barmy. That was ok! According to Chloe and Garfunkel (? Who knows what his real name is, but Chloe called him Garfunkel) I have a good set of teachers, which includes the head of sixth form and the deputy head, both of which are quite cool. i've also been pursuaded to audition for the school production on Monday night....... CABARET! One MOnday night we all have to go along for 2 hours where we will be taught for a song and dance routine, and then we'll  havbe to go back on Wednesday and actually do the audition to a panel of, um, teachers I guess! Nayway should be a laugh and the 6th form always get heavily involved (so I am assured by various upper 6th and school council members), so what the hell? I'm going along with Chloe and her friends, so should be a laugh if that;s all. Looking forward to tomorrow, Chloe has promised to bring me in her Placebo albums for me to borrow..............

       Well I had an induction half-day at Oxted today, and I think it's going to be cool. We had a house meeting and my head of house is really nice (always a good start when u have friendly staff around), then we went to various sessions on how to think, revise and work efficiently, some of which was useful (but most wasn't!). Got chatting to quite a few people about things, generally it's cool and my tutor is nice, in all aspects!! ;) Anyway! Not got much else to say really. Tah tah

       lol fair enough! I've got a bit of a problem in that on my student card I've got one of the photos that we got done on the last day of school, and I'm in me warlingham uniform. That means everytime I have to show the damned thing on the train I'm probably gonna get mobbed by Oxted kids. It's weird thinking Oxted'#s my school now, and Warlingham's a thing of the past!

       I agree Tom. The odd fancy dress party like Andy sometimes has is fun and amusing because that is all it is, fancy dress and a party.  But anyway, if your trick or treating don't bother coming to my house because we never open our door to any person silly enough to knock on complete strangers houses.   I got back from Birmingham yesterday. It was cool. The uni is right in teh city centre so a five minute walk and there is the train station and many a shop. HUGE shopping centres there. I got some new clothes but I've run out of room so I need hangers and I need more drawers. Sorry about not blogging Jackie, I haven't had time. Harass Max. He hasn't said a word yet about Max Payne 2.

       I hate Halloween. It has strange routes that nobody is quite sure about, it's a bit of a famine in the 1840s in New England, USA. It's a bit of the Irish about a man called Jack who made a deal with the devil, making the Jack-o-lantern - used to be in a turnip but the USA decided it would be better to use pumpkins as there were more of them. Trick-or-treating comes from Celts and was actually to give food to the needy on 2nd November in return for giving prayers to the dead on their path to heaven. It is the Celtic New Year as the summer officaly ends, acording to the Celts in 5 BC. There really isn't much in it at all. I'm sorry to be the evil and unsprited one, but I refuse to be sucked into this. Children running around wearing stupid masks  threatening  people to give them sweets which are going to make them fat. Old people have a terrible time and every year you read about an old lady somewhere going to hospital or having her house attacked. I don't care how great it is to dress up and run around looking silly, you can do that any day of the week in my house and get away with it, come on round, it will be a ball.

Or Stepdad. or Family friend. 9. what 10. because our brains are dumb and are not photographic enough 11. what are you on about 12. 9 13. lonely. keanu no. its, aaaaaaaaaaaah! I have no bloody idea! 14. inside blaines head  15. how are you.  Right now all I have to say is: life can keanu off and keanu annoy some other poor keanu soul.

       Concorde stops flying on Friday :(  Nicki got Picture 2 correct first (probably because she sent the e-mail at 7:30am that day) Max got both the pictures correct, but Picture 2 after Nicki. Jo bot both of them correct, but 1 day and 1 hour after Max. So Nicki gets a hug, Max gets 10p (unless he really wants a hug) and Jo gets a smile.

       Well Today I was approached by a neighbor ova the road asking whether I could babysit on a Monday night her two kids from bout 8ish till 10ish for a fiver as she goes to a keepfit class, now of course I said yes as it means I get a fiver for doing nothing as both kids will be in bed! Yay. I can watch T.V, do my homework or ne thing really! So it means I wont be on Msn much on a Monday any more cause I wont have time! Also I will find out on Wednesday whether I will have a job, hopefully I will cause I need some money! I am also enjoying Karate at the moment as its really good, although it does leaves you with aching legs for a couple of days after cause they make you do stretching for like 10 mins and it really hurts! But now I can touch my toes and before I went I couldn't touch them, so at least I have learnt something. I will also be starting my first Kata, this is the moves I need to pass for yellow belt, which I will be taking in something like 3 months! Yay Trampolining is also going well, I am starting to learn how to do a backwards somersault as I can now do a front somersault and a front piked somersault! My sister was home again this weekend from Uni, although she didn't spend much of it actually at home, she was out with her mates for most of the time! I think she spent apporx 3 hours actually at home not including sleeping! LOL unfortunately she has to leave at like 3 on a Sunday cause it takes like 5 or 6 hours to get back, this time she was getting driven back so she didn't have to get a number of trains and buses! I am looking forward to the sponsored walk, i don't know why as I'm gonna be knackered afterwards as I'm actually walking the thing instead of helping out! Oh yea does anyone want to sponsor me? You don't have to cause i already got a few but you can if you want to. HEHE

       (These are me trying to do the dullest blogs possible)  Earlier today I was sittiing on a chair. I stood up but felt a little dizzy. I sat down. I stood up again and put on my bag. I took a step forward onto my right foot. I stopped and picked up my jacket. I carried on walking. I went outside. It felt chilly. I took off my bag. I put on my jacket. I was warmer. I carried on walking.

       That's niice Nicki, is it related to something you've been doing in English, or just some random burst of spontinuity??  I am sitting here at the computer typing. I read Nicki's blog about hot chocola te. I suddenly get the urge to make some hotchocolate. I rise from my chair. I go to make some hot chocolate

       I wanted to make a drink. I went into the kitchen and I picked up a mug. I put four heaped spoons of hot chocolate powder into the mug. I filled the kettle with water. I put some milk into my mug. I stirred the milk in with the powder until it was a chocolate goo. I waited for the water to boil. I poured the water into the mug. I stirred it up. I took a sip. It burnt my lip. I waited for it to cool. When it was cool I drunk some more. It was nice.

       Nicki was the first to win, so she gets to choose a hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. Jo got it second, so she gets the runners up prize, a smile. :)  Name the object srounded in white.    What is curently on the white/black dot? It's an old photograph, so the buildings around it have changed.    Do not post your ideas on El-Bloggo! Send them to me via e-mail to my normal address. You can now edit and change dates and times on El-Bloggo, plus you might give others ideas!  Not sure how easy/hard you'll find those. If you get both of them you win a massive hug/20 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get one of them correct you win a medium sized hug/15 pence/take me out to dinner. If you get close on both/either of them you get a normal hug/10 pence/take me out to dinner. If you have no idea then you get a look of disapointment/-10 pence (you give me money)/take me out to lunch (not quite as good as dinner).  Good luck! I get back Thursday late afternoon. Bye bye.

       If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd worked for all my life, And I had to start again with just my children and my wife, I'd thank my lucky stars to be living here today, 'Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take that away.    I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.   From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee, Across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea. From Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A., There's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say:   I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free, And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me, And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today, 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land God Bless the U.S.A.

That is good because I get paid overtime and its extra because its a Sunday. Btw Jackie, Pam was asking Lora about you. My day was fine. Right now I am not impressed as I am cold, I burnt my pizza again and I have just been attacked by a huge spider and now I am kinda depressed at James, Jon and Leon because I don't liek people hating me or hating me for no reason.

       James, Jon and Leon are those 'freinds'. I don't even know why, they are being silly. I haven't done or said anything to annoy them and thats the truth, I have torn it all apart trying to see what I did which has made them hate me but I haven't done anything. Whatever the problem is its theirs and I can't be bothered with them anymore if they are going to be silly. As I said, I am not that upset with it because I have you guys and you are what is important. Tom, glad its all working out for you! Yay! Max, Jo - BLOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL.

       School is much better now. I've switched from doing AS Business & Economics to AVCE Business Studies. The main difference is the AS concenrates on the whys of thing, why does the economy work like it does, how does demand and supply work and things that happen right around the world. The AVCE is much more how a business works (as opose to how the world works), so it includes human resources, marketing and general business stuff - something which I'm finding much easier and will probably be more use to me in the long run. Unfortunatly I've had to drop Geography because of that (blocks don't fit) which is a shame - but you can't have it all can you! My NUS card arrived yesterday, and my Driving Licence arrived today! Yay! Hehe.

       What survey? Well I am pissed off with the Sixth Form only because that the party they have organised for us is located at a club/bar we aren't even allowed in so that is gay and pointless. Other than that I am still enjoying Sixth Form. I thinks its fab. Over the past week I have lost 3, what I thought were close, friends but I am not too bothered as I have gained loads more and I still of course have you fabulas guys! Oh THAT survey.

       This guy walks into a bar, pulls out a tiny piano, stool, and a tiny little man. The tiny man sits down, and starts to play the piano. This other guy notices it. "Hey, what's that?" "A twelve-inch pianist. You see, I found this magic lamp, rubbed it, made a wish, I got a twelve inch pianist." "Can I try?" The man with the piano agrees and a minute later, a million ducks fill the room. "Ducks? I didn't wish for a million ducks, I wished for a million bucks!" "You think I really wished for a twelve inch pianist?"

Jackie - the batik has come out really well, the colours are sooooo nice!!!! Max - paintballing......wooooooooo! Tom - baa. bleep.  Ok so I had an argument with James from Cumbria trip last night, I don't know if we are speaking now or not but I'm not as bothered now that my friends have grown with new folk and like the grunger lot. Its not too bad. I have found out that on Saturday - and probably Sunday - I will be working at Woolies from 8.30AM to 5.30PM (or later). Argh!!!!! I will be so tired on Monday.

       Oh. Right. Okay then. Glad you had a nice evening.  I would've been there but of course when tickets were purchased I was forgotten about which I'm still slightly annoyed about but oh well. I'm used to it so never mind.  Interesting day at work yesterday. Spent all day on stock room with Dean. Very amusing. He bailed on me for Wednesday though, he forgot he has to work so I only get him for like an hour and you can't see a film in an hour so now I'm gonna see if Rudders wants to come. Did have an idea for Wednesday which I was going to put forward to you Tom but it doesn't matter now seeing as you seem to be in London all the time and I'm sure if my plan work it would turn into another day going anywhere but the place I wanted. Or maybe we'd end up somewhere I didn't have aticket. Oh I don't know. Doesn't matter now.  If Rudders doesn't wanna come to cinema then I guess I'll be at home all day. Wahey. Even though I have tonnes of xmas shopping to you.  I have to go to work. I really don't want to today, I feel too bad and I think I will ask Pam if I can come home if it isn't too busy and there are enough people working. Got my pay. 160. Less than last time but I lost 30 when I was away for the geology trip. Ah well. What is money?   Glad we won. We are the rugby world champions. Yay us. God bless you Johnny.

       One boy, one girl, two hearts, their world Time goes by, secrets rise One more, sad song, tears shed, she's gone She'd take it back, if she only could  Woooooooo! All-American Rejects, London Astoria. Yay, that was brilliant. Fantastic place, didn't get squished, great music, nice venue, lovely to see Jo again with her super-cool short hair. They finished with The Last Song, and the stupid things is I joked about that before we went in. A couple of them had Union flag thongs, which was, um, nice? One of the support bands where a bit nutty, especialy the guy on the keyboard, he was bouncing around like a headless chicken. Funny though. Many more people crowd surfing than at Enanesence, but not quite as voilent. One guy got on the stage and started worshiping the second support band. So all in all a very pleasent evening, thanks Jo!

        The Dante's Inferno Test has banished you to  the Sixth Level of Hell - The City of Dis!   Here is how you matched up against all the levels:     Level    Score       urlLink Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very Low       urlLink Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Low       urlLink Level 2   (Lustful)   High       urlLink Level 3   (Gluttonous)   High       urlLink Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Moderate       urlLink Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   High       urlLink Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very High       urlLink Level 7   (Violent)   High       urlLink Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Moderate       urlLink Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very High      Take the  urlLink Dante's Divine Comedy Inferno Test    You approach Satan's wretched city where you behold a wide plain surrounded by iron walls. Before you are fields full of distress and torment terrible. Burning tombs are littered about the landscape. Inside these flaming sepulchers suffer the heretics, failing to believe in God and the afterlife, who make themselves audible by doleful sighs. You will join the wicked that lie here, and will be offered no respite. The three infernal Furies stained with blood, with limbs of women and hair of serpents, dwell in this circle of Hell.

       Lucky you Jo, only Limbo. I'm a little devil nearly. A violent little devil. Where you two off to tomorrow?  I think some of Jacko's music is ok, even good but as a person he is very very strange.  Bush has gone home today. Hope he enjoyed his pub lunch. Media have been attacked in Baghdad. Wopee. The war is upon us again.  I'm still feeling ill. Headache and stuffy nose now. I didn't leave school until 3pm which was pretty dumb seeing as we had an early closure and I had fourth free so I could've gone home at 1.30. Oh well. Work at 9am tomorrow. Yay.

       First Level of Hell - Limbo  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Charon ushers you across the river Acheron, and you find yourself upon the brink of grief's abysmal valley. You are in Limbo, a place of sorrow without torment. You encounter a seven-walled castle, and within those walls you find rolling fresh meadows illuminated by the light of reason, whereabout many shades dwell. These are the virtuous pagans, the great philosophers and authors, unbaptised children, and others unfit to enter the kingdom of heaven. You share company with Caesar, Homer, Virgil, Socrates, and Aristotle. There is no punishment here, and the atmosphere is peaceful, yet sad.

       Well I got up at 10.30 today. I have no sore throat but now I have a stuffy nose, blocked ears and a werid head.  I had to go to Croydon to get some fabric which I have been putting off for ages. met up with amy who I haven't seen for four months. We went to The George and I was drinking JD and coke and now I feel a bit funny cos I had a few. Apaprently you can get drunk on JD quickly so, er, I think I am bit tipsy? I wil be back tomorrow, shouldn't be cos I'm still ill but i can't afford anymore days off.

        I'm too stupid to eat a Kit-Kat.   I'm pissed off, this is PC or what ever gone way to far. On my Kit-Kat that I have just eaten it did not have Kit-Kat written on it, but on one bar break and the other here. My chocolate has ingraved into it instructions on how to eat it. What else I'm I going to bloody well do with it? It's a fucking Kit-Kat, you break it down the middle, that's why it's there, that's why it has that massive line, everybody knows that and if they don't they are too bloody stupid to read!  Unfortunatly I can't boycott Nestl otherwise I'll have nothing to eat in the mornings (Shreddies, ummmm). But I'm boycotting Kit-Kat, along with McDonalds, Burger King and the Heathrow Express.

       Yeah. Go Nicki. I am working 10 till 6 tomorrow, and 10.30 to 2.30 on Sunday. Whoppee. But at least I get 83, and it still leaves me with time to do work. Yeah, That's the life.  Not much else really, apart from when I was doing duties yeterday there was about 200 kids swarming, it was blatanlty obvious that something was happening, but what did we do? nothing. We decided it looked too scary and they were taller than us, so we just watched. Then teachers of all shapes and sizes started running after them, shouting and yelling at them and each other. It later aspired that there was some kinda major fight and then two other serious isolated incidents, and we did nothing. Makes me feel quite guilty really. Hey ho, life goes on.

       Come on folks. Lets hear about you and your week or your day.  My week has been strange. Very stressful, very tiring. Had to work again last night, shut myself in a cage by accident while taking cages out to lorry. Erm...what else?? Textiles is going good. Geology still sucks but Seward is helping me a bit more now. I had a chat with him and at least we know where the other one stands. Scottie-doo is talking to me again even though I still don't know why he wasn't in the first place. But hey, hes back at least. Erm...what else. Yea Jackie brought me some mice earlier from Woolies. I ate them. I have to work tomorrow 8.30 - 6.00. Great. Oh well. I get to see Dean haven't seen him in a while.

       I spoke to Carvell today. She is going to leave Seward a note and she said she'll sit in on a lesson next week. I'm not sure entirely why, maybe to see how I am in lessons or how Seward reacts to me asking for help? I'm not sure. I just hope it will work. Actually thinking about it now I hope I haven't got Seward into trouble.  Shit. I've just messed everything up now haven't I? Omgomgomgomg. Why can't everything be simple??? Ok I better go now and sort my head out cos its just got incredibly full of random confused thoughts again like Friday.

Fortuantely I don't have alot to do, otherwise I would be stuffed.  I have till training at 5pm tomorrow, I hope it all goes ok and I don't end up looking too stupid! Anyway. I got my lovelly fleece and my name badge yesterday, I haven't got my trousers and my shirts yet, so at the moment I have to wear my own black trousers, a whiote shirt, and keep my jacket done up, lol. Fair enough. Anyway, I really should go and do some work now because I should. Otherwise I'll feel vyer bad. My bargain buy for the day was 3 paris of tights from Primark in Bromely- red, blue and turqoise- 1 each. To go with my bargain boots and my bargian skirt. Wahey. I'm strange. Whatever. See y'all later guys. Bye

That blog about me feeling happier - lies! All lies! I need to speak to Madame Carvell on monday, Pennie has ordered me to. She said that I really need to go tell someone. I guess it makes sense. I don't want to spend every lunch time like I did on Friday. :(

Thinking of doing the IMAX for my birthday but not sure at the moment. What do you think? After the film (you'll all be proud of me for this! I am!!!) I went into the leather shop and asked them about the Matrix Reloaded jacket they have in the window. He let me try it on! Woooooooooooo! And it suited me! Honest it did! I WILL be saving up for it. Trust me. I'm going to Spain on the art trip. Wahoo!

Its annoying mebecause I can't stop it! And maybe I want to be miserable for a couple days. Then maybe someone will realise something is wrong and will try and help even if its only a hug.

       Yeah that's very true. Good point. With my politics lessons we watched this thing called "Mark Thomas: Debt Collector" and what I heard was appauling. Loads of big corporations like HSBC and other ones that lent money to Saddam's regime and sold him weapons worth millions, now he's gone they're demanding their money back. Iraq's debt is something like 30 billion and is going up all the time due to interest. HSBC are demaning something like 200 million back from Iraq, which puts like a 12,000 debt on the head of every Iraqi- money they simply don't have and can't get. I thought that was really rude an absolutely ridiculous, but this program was really eye-opening.  Anyway, enough of that, but I am finding politics really interesting now I actually understand about it! Shut up Jo. Go do something useful.

       There is something else I would like to bitch about. Attitudes to war. People are still slagging off Iraq and our involvment as well as Americas. I can see why people are so against it but I wish people would just give it up and give their soliders the support they deserve. I sat here and listened to someone go on and on about the mess we've made well we haven't! We've taken away the rules and are trying to put in place new ones will are more beneficial to the country. GAH.

       I agree with Jackie again. Except that I don't drink alcohol mainly because the stuff I do drink is never at the parties we go to. I am what some of my sisters uni mates call a 'mature drinker' because I drink stuff like JD and Coke or champagne. I don't like the cheaper alcopops and things. I can see why Jackie drinks and I think teh way she drinks is fine. She has a few but never enough to make her tipsy or anything more. I don't have a problem with people like that I just don't like folk getting drunk because its just plain stupid. Back to the example of Andy - missed his own party. Jenny at his party, threw up everywhere and probably felt like shit the next day liek most who got pissed. Its dumb. You can't remember it so whats the point in even going? Our leavers ball - it was mainly the popular or tarty lot that were drunk, they can't remember half of it. Our lot: no alcohol, just high on the buzz of the evening and we can remember every precious moment. Glad Dave's party was good. I spent the evening doing bloody homework because I was given way to much to do. I mean its half term for goodness sake, its a holiday. We should be relaxing, getting our systems back to their full potential not running them down further by working. Its not even as if I actually went away on holiday. I spent a few days on the geology trip which was doing geology work so that is fair enough, then two days with my sister at her uni who I haven't seen since she went which again is fair enough. I think family comes before college. I wouldn't be suprised if I told the teachers 'I haven't had time to do the work because I was in hospital after being a car accident' and even if it was true they would still yell at me.  I am sick of life right now. I mean is it really worth all this? All this stress over a few pieces of work, the stress of earning enough money, the stress of knowing what you want to do in life and who you want to be with. Its too much and soon its gonna get me. As Spike says:  From Beneath You It Devours

       Nicki - I wasn't having a go, anyway if you want me to, I will, so here goes....  MAX PAYNE 2 IS THE BEST GAME EVAR!!!  There aint really much to say except its bloody brilliant.  Yup, and Dave.D's party was kewl, Andy kept chucking stuff up this girl's skirt and Rob was dancing quite happily with this pissed girl. At the end of the party, Lee phoned his house to ask if his parents could pick him up. Okay, so when his parents didnt turn up half an hour later, we dropped him back home. He lived literally 30 seconds walk from Dave's house. *Hits head hard on table*.

       Yes i happily drink alcohol, but i have never drunk more than 3 bottles in one night, i have never got drunk and if there is no alcohol then i dont give a flying fuck. And from knowing my sister and her friends and half of the school most peeps are not like me, ask most peeps and there idea of a good night is going out and getting drunk so that they dont remeber a thing that happened! For me thats just sad? Why bother going out at all if your not gonna remebr ne of it? I'd rather go out and have no alcohol and be with my mates all night long! Just think Andy missed his own party cause he went over the top with alcohol.  Alcohol is just another thing for the government to make money on. In fact i dont even like the taste of most alcohol the only reason ireally drink it is to fit in, if i go to a party and everyone is drink ing then i will do it or peeps say- "omg your sad, how can you not drink? your 16 not 6" I find dat quite annoying so i drink. I'm just glad im sensible not to drink to much to end up throwing all over the place! And just to let you know I'm feeling kinda stressed so if that sounds rude... Then it IS!

       Hey guys. I#m back from the wilderness. I'm alive. I feel a bit cold, but other than that i'm fine. Dunno when I start on my new job in Safeways yet, but I'm looking foward to it. Sad, aren't I? Anyway, Just got a whopping fat history essay to do today, ippee. I haven#'t seen PAul in over a week, boohoo. Can't see him today- too much work to do. Might be stating work tomorrow, but who knows? Life's to damned complicated. Tell all abotu DAve's party. I take it this is Dave Dodson??

       I agree with Jackie about the alcohol. You see what kinda of trouble sixteen year olds do get into and then eighteen year olds. Its pretty outrageous. And TOm I don't think Jackie is being hypocritical because yes she does drink quite happily at parties but she doesn't go out of her way to get drunk like Pennie and Helen. Jackie is one of these people where if there is alcohol she will have some, not loads, some. If there isn't then fine. It doesn't matter. I think? Jackie? Max - you never told me that. You haven't exactly blogged all aboutit like you usually do going on and on about the graphics etc..  You know how everyone seems to have 2 lines. One line is simple to get to, it can be crossed by something hurtful or by general stress. The second line is harder and when you get to it thats when you seriously start to think about things, life, people. Is it really worth it? I'm nearing that second line rapidly. I can't handle the amount of work I have. I don't have the time. I can't work any harder than I am now.

       Well I had a very sleepless night last night. I didn't go to Dave's party because I had way too much work to do so yesterday afternoon / evening I sat upstairs and did my art and as much of my textiles as I can (bearing in mind the machine I borrowed from school broke, helpful). I think I had like a 40 minute break when I was the phone to Jackie and that was it. Okay so maybe 40 minutes is an exageration. I don't know. However, I didn't sleep well because I was stressing out way too much. I need these final pieces done but I can't do them. I still have all my English Lit to do and I can't do it because I don't have the time. This is way too much and if I am not careful I will probably have one of those anexity attacks or just generally freak out.

       Yes the film starts at 12.15. I said on the email see you in the screen rather than everyone meeting before cos they could be quite a few of us.  The air marshalls would be disguised as normal passengers. The ones in Amnerica are on all flights in the US. If there were 6 terrosists as you say then ok so maybe it wouldn't work but at least those on the plane would have a better chance to live rather than dieing without a fight. Like those on teh plane that was headed for the whitehouse, it crashed before then because of the passengers taking over. They died yes, but they still gave themselves a small chance. I can see what you mean as well about them coming over from the Muslim countries but the amount of terrosists we have in our country right now is amazing. So many have been caught etc.. I don't know if it would work but I think its worth a try. Air marshalls to be on suspected flights or random flights. You never know, they may just be there to help one day.

       I believe that the air marshals are going to be disguised as ordinary civillians. Which then suggests that actually, they aren't going to be on many flights.  very good point Jackie. The only time someone has tried to hijack a plane on their own was when that AFrican bloke who was criminally insane tried to take over. But he really was mentally ill I think. If terrorists were going to hijack a plane and do something really evil and horrible, then I would presume there would be a few people, like a team of them. That's what they did on 9/11, I think.   I can't come to the cinema tomorrow, I have to be at work for 2pm. Sorry guys!  How typical is this- (you know on american web pages where they put the top-5 searches? This is one of them, and not off a dodgy site either, the netscape news site!):  Top Men's Searches     Wet T-Shirts  Beach Trips  Micro Bikini  Viagra  Adult Toys

       Guns on airplanes to me sounds like a stupid idea! If that person needed the money someone cud buy them and get them to give them the gun on a flight! Not only that but if there are like 6 terrorists on the plane they can easily take the plane, the air marshals wud be shot and killed possibly with their own guns! Are these air marshals gonna be wearing uniforms? Or are they just gonna look like normal passingers? Nicki you saying about  maybe only on transatlantic flights? Whats that gonna do? the terrorists will be more likely to pick on local flights as they did on the 9/11 attack. Most of the planes brought down were local ones!  No onto more pressing matters... The cinema tmor? You sed meet at 12.15? The film actually starts then though!

       Hmmm. Well I'm still standing by my comments of yesterday, I just wanted to add a few things in response to people's comments. Although I agree to some extent with what Max said, there was still a fair amount of child abuse going on, it just wasn't 'done' to publicise it. For example Myra Hindley, the Moors Murders, the West murders, the kid who was abused and then hung from a tree in Reigate..... there were numerous notorious child abusers/murders. I think it can't have been so easy to get guns 20 or 30 years ago, I think a lot of the guns nowadays are imported cheaply and illegally from America. Hence tighter import checks and better security, and higher penalties for being caught. I don't like the idea of air marshals. Ok, perhaps it may stop loonies from trying to hijack a flight, but why sholud they get them just on trans-atlantic flights? I would have thought that there would be a much higher risk coming from flights from the middle east to Britain and from the middle east to the USA. Without being rascist (although it's going to sound it), most of the terrorists are 'freedom fighters' etc from Muslim and Arab countries. I understand that you can't put air marshals on their flights because they are Arab airlines (not British and American ones), but I really do not think it is anything to do with flights from Britain. What I want to know is,  who is paying for these air marshals- us, the British tax-payers; or the Americans, who are the ones who are so up-tight about it anyway?  I woudl lay my money on it being us who has to fork out for it. But there we go again, me getting back to how Blair has become Bush's lap-dog. Absolutley disgusting that one man can just do what he wants at will with a country.  My final moan for the day on the point of guns. It's not directly related, but I think it needs to be said.  I personally believe that capital punishment should be brought back. People like Ian Huntley do not deserve to live. Ok, God said "Thou shalt not kill", but surely that works both ways- we shouldn't kill him, but he sholudn't have killed in the first place? But look back to the old testament- "An eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth"- surely this suggests that he should get what's coming to him? More and more British citizens are being imprisoned, and half the time they aren't even British citizens! This pushes up the price of keeping prisoners all the time, and like all the other good things in life, the money spent on the prisons by the good old British governemtn has to come from the tax payers. It would be a darn site cheaper to execute them. No mess, no hassle, no money, no protests about them being allowed to go on hunger strike, not giving them the safety of being locked up so they can't be mobbed for their heinous crimes, not giving them the chance to take their own lives and become 'martyrs' for other criminals of their types. Numerous states in America still use capital punishment, so why can't we? I believe that would be the answer. We should become a more agressive state in our policing policies- more police, more security for them, more severe punishment. Not just 'life sentences' that turn into 10 years behind bars because the culprit has 'reformed' or is let out on 'good behaviour'. If they're sick enough to commit a crime in the first place, then that violent/sadistic/homicidal/perverted/abusive tendancy is always going to be there.  Think that's all i wanted to have a moan about.

       I like the points everyone has made. Especially Jo's. Remember thsi can be discussed all week so we can keep this going. And make it to the blogs of note one day :) hehe.  Guns. Well. I look at America where it is so easy to get a gun. Open a bank account, get a free gun! That is outrageous. It gives the police there no authority at all. I think here our poilce force should be allowed guns. Not big guns, handguns maybe, some sort of gun. Or at least get officers out and about where they can be seen with guns so not everyone can carry then. I think knowing the police have guns would make people think twice about it so I agree with what Jo said. Even though I dislike the French...  I agree with you Jackie about there always being crime but hopefully the presense of guns would decrease general crime or at least put a stop to these shootings. Yes the highest trained gunman could miss but then think of the damage someone who isn't trained could do. I'd rather know there was someone at least slightly trained with a gun than someone who knows little. How about these air marshalls? Guns on planes? I think that we should have them on transatlanic flights, they aremost likely to be hijacked and as American have proved it has worked so far. I understand the worries about guns and the pressure of teh cabin but I think someone said on sky news they woudl take that into consideration and modify the planes or something. Someone else has created bullets which are made specially not to cause damage to the area. One shatters on impact and things like that. I think they are a good idea as I know what its like to be sitting there on a 9 hour flight and wondering what could happen.

       Let a load of people (like the Krays) out on the streets (with guns). When they were around, there was a lot less child abuse and the like. Why? Because the child abusers/killers were frightened because they would be found by em and get killed.  Ian Huntley would have been dead long ago.

       Guns- Death  Thats basically my veiw, guns shouldnt be allowed ne where, surely there must be a better way of patrolling the streets, even if the highest trained professional gun shooted could mis aim and therefor fatally injure someone. I beleive that things like stun guns should be made standard issue for  policce officers as they are far less dangerous. But there again jo has made a good point, crimals wont be so inclined to perform illegal acts if they see police carrying guns.  But if you think about it there will always be crime, whether it be viscious or not. There is nothng we can do to stop it. In my view prevention is better than stopping it mid way.

       No I don't think we should be allowed to carry guns. Bad news. Knives are illegal, and I presume so are guns? I deinetly don't think we shoudl be allowed them, because there is such a fine line between 'self defence' and 'attack' that it woudl be so hard to tell the difference, and there would just be unlawful killings happening left, right and centre. Can you imagine what croydon would be like with guns? http://www.defense.gouv.fr/gendarmerie/ However, I do believe that we should have two branches of the police, as france do. They have the 'Gendarmerie' and 'Police'. The police are like the local units who just work in the rural areas, minor offences in rural areas, blah blah, i think. Then the Gendarmerie are the more military-style ones '[I think they actually refer to themselves as being a branch of the French Army, see  urlLink the official website (If not just for the pictures!) ) ], who patrol urban areas and cities. This reduces the crime rate in cities, and France have a very low gun-crime rate, I believe. I believe that this is due to the scary image of the Gendarmerie- they have bold blue uniforms (shirts, trousers and jackets, all of same colour), knee length leather boots, black caps, and they  all carry guns  , in highly visible places. Yet the french never have any 'incidents' of accidental shooting of police officers and innocent civillians. In addition, in the big towns like Paris, they have gendermerie armed with sub-machine guns. Now that is a scary site, but crime rates? What crime??! I believe our policing system should be changed to allowed armed officers in the centres of towns and high-risk districts, not to protect themselves and other citizens, but to deter and prevent gun-crime altogether. Say you were about to commit and violent mugging on a women, say you were going to knife her to ger her handbag, money and phone, you would perhaps consider it if you see two lone policemen walking down the street, say 500m away, not near enough to catch you. But what if those same two policemen each had a gun holster containing standard-issue pistols? I wouldn't even dream of it, and I don't think any criminal would either. I rest my case.

Cinema on Wednesday, 12.15, Grants, Peter Pan. Come if you wish, bring who you want.  Question / topic to discuss this week:  Guns.  A policeman was killed a few days ago from a shooting. Should we be allowed to carry guns? America have a death rate of over 11,000 people a year being killed by guns. Your views?

Yesterday luckily it wasn't busy at all and didn't have to open the front till too much. I got to put out the pic'a'mix yesterday with Charlene and Lora which was hilariously funny. You have no idea how much fun it is. LOL.  Today I'm on entertainment all day as Caroline is off on holiday. Should be ok.  Tomorrow I have to run into Croydon to get fabric for textiles and then I have to leave because mother is getting my Birthday things. Yayness. Wednesday I'm going to see Peter Pan with Ritchie. I will do something for my birthday with everyone but prob once we are back at college on an evening I know everyone is free. Took a trip last night up to the infamous addington estate. That is not an area you want to park the car in trust me...keep it moving. LOL. Dad was showing me some of the houses there. One of the houses is decorated with lights and whatnot. But tha front is covered, the back is covered, the side is covered and the roof is covered. And its soooo tacky!!! Have fun today!

       Interesting idea. I had an idea a while ago which would make the blog more exciting (slightly) and would hopefully get some good discussions going. Each week I will ask someone to choose a subject / event or sme kind of question. Then basically you spend the next week discussing it as well as normal blogging. For example the title could be: "President Bush". Then people can use that as a starting point. What do you think?

       Have you read those blogs that won awards from that guardian competition? I read the two teenage winners. The boys one was good but not very funny, but the girl called Olivia, hers is just so random that it's really funny. Completly random. I think we should do something to spice up our blog. Like have different cateogries and put someone in charge of each category. Like Our News, World News and our Views, Events in our lives, stuff like that, make  it funny and not just a regular ole blog.

We came back with nothing so we had lunch and with the firm instructions from mother of 'go and get some christmas lights' we headed out again. Went way out, right off to the M25 to a garden centre there. We brought a set of new crimbo lights, a new candle light set and this sicky stuff to hang your crimbo cards up on. So all in all, a sucess. Yesterday evening Jackie and I went to see  Elf ! I loved it. I love kiddies films. Soooo funny. SAAAAAAAANTA! I know him! I know him!

We couldn't get into the car park, we had to park miles down the road, and then there was so many people in there it was dangerous!!! I nearly lost a toe, being run over by a mad old woman and her trolley. Safeways is a much safer place to live. Plus, they have all their xmas sweeties reduced already. Big Bags of chocolate coins for 39p, and HUGE drums of xmas-tree marshmellows for only 99p. Bargain. Plus 10% off, makes life so much more fun. My mummy got 47 off her shopping in double discount weekend, twas very cool! Meant that the alcohol i pursuaded her to buy was only 3.20- bargain! Anywho, must go now!

       That was very phiospical Max.  Well on Thursday I went shopping with Jackie which was un as we found Beckett and spent about 30 mins sitting on those massage things. How amusing.Yesterday I went to Croydon with Lisa. We shopped ( I brought some skate jeans ) and had pizza hut which was fun. We have a Dutch waiter! Today I worked from 8.30 til 5.30. I have Dean his present, must have been happy with it cos he gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek so that made my made of course. Tomorrow I'm working from 10 til 4.30. Them Monday and Tuseday will most likely be me doing homework as I have many a final piece to do. Wednesday I'm working 1 - 6. Friday I'm working 12.30 - 5.30. Thats good because that is overtime pay so wopee!!  On crimbo day it will be me, Mum, Caz and Dad. That is good because last year we had to post pone xmas for a day as Dad was working so we had our xmas on Boxing day. dad is working on my birthday though which means I'll be spending most of the day worrying because new year eve's party goers who get drunk and stuff can cause an awful amount of trouble and it has been known for police to get injured etc.. so I won't be that happy on that night.

       Okay Max, Maybe you need to get out a bit more? Well today woz judgement day, i went and saw lord of the rings. Now it woz a gud film although i beleive it could of been considerably cut down in length cause there were many parts you didnt need to see. Also the cinema didnt put a break in like they said a little while ago on there site! I was quite annoyed with that cause i didnt wanna miss ne of the film by going to the toilet! So i waited till it had finshed then rushed to the toilet, ask Andy Scott and DAvid i woz in there for a while! But over all a good film, i would advise you to go see it, but only if you seen the first two films otherwise you would get a bit lost in the plot! So wot are peeps Crimbo plans? Ne one going ne where specail? Tmor im working in the morning then going to my cousins for crimbo dinner, then sunday im working. On crimbo day i think my grandparents are coming over so that should be fun! Other than wokring thats about all im doing!

       Something pretty scary happened today...  I was bored, and I looked at the clock on my PC. The year scale went right up to 2099. By 2099, I would be about 112. No way am I going to live that long. Then something occured to me; one of the dates that is sitting in right front of me is the day i'll die. Nice thought, no? And as well as the fact that the PC could outlive me in terms of time...  Anyhow, um...prawn cocktail Wotsits are minging.

       Alternatively, you could embrace the christmas vibe by inviting evey stray dog into the neighbour hood and feeding them roast ham and dog biscuits. That's always fun.

       No Jo. I am not excited. I have too much work to do. Fuck xmas, it can piss off this year.  Damit. Its all your fault Jackie. Because you didn't babysit last night, and you didn't do the weekly text thing I completely forgot Changing Rooms was on!  I MISSED IT. O how depressing. I think I shall fall into Hamlet mode: 'O that this too too sulied flesh would melt....' Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Yay for the trampoling thing though. An I don't go on about it, only mentioned it once because of the hand signal convo. Thats it. Its like my geology class. Every lesson its usually Beckett who brings it up but the subject of Dean and I always comes into conversation. And the room always goes quiet just as we aretalking about it so then either the whole class join in or we're told we are a bunch of gays by Seward. Ahhhh.

       No I'm not excited, possibly because i havent brought any presents yet! My sister arrived home around 1 hour ago, came in for about 20 mins and tehn went striaght back out again! ( You can tell she was glad to see us) I'm really happy at the moment as i just got back from trampolining and i can now do a back summersault into a seat drop! Considering i only passed my back summersault last week im quite proud of myself! I seem to have a bit of a cold, not a runny nose cold but a annoying sore throat, which isnt always there and a horrible throaty gooey feeling... I am also very happy cause i didnt have to babysit tonite! Which means that i have moe time to do homework.. Althoughi bet i dont do anything in this extra time i have been given. I wish i had never told people who i fancy now cause thats all they sem to go on about! Grrrr, How annoying. And no guys you aint finding out who unless i already told you or you find out from somone i told! Now this is feeling like a very long blog to me so i think i will bring it to a bit of a abrupt end.

       I'm here guys. I've just been exceptionally tired, ill, and so exhausting I come home from school and collapse, and I am getting up so incredibly early to use my light box now, I have hardly any spare time. Oh the joys of being a student/cashier at safeways. At least they pay me lots, and I'm getting a new phone! It's contract, 13.99 a month with 50 free texts amd 750 free minutes, and it's a Nokia 6100! Wahey! I'm excited. Are you?

       I can't believe the gramatical error made: "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him." It should be "we've got him" or "we have got him", not "we got him"; it doesn't make any sense like that. Argghh.

It needs to be improved. A zero-tolerance rule should be applied like in the states.  We havent got our Christmas tree up yet.

       Interesting interesting. No I haven't heard from Jo. Not since I saw her at Speech day.   I spent half an hour last night sitting in front of my christmas tree thinking about my final art piece for Starky, based around Autobiography. It can be anything so long as you can somehow link it back to you. My link is that my father was a firefighter.  My piece will be based around those firefighters lost in September 11th. (By the way, I releasied this in general studies last week, the Americans go on and on about what a tragedy it was for all those firefighters to die. Fair enough. But what about the paramedics and police? They died too. They all do the same life threatening job. Just in different ways.) What I will do is construct a war cross (American war cemetryes which I have visited - a plain white cross). I will not paint it white but photocopy headlines and pages from books about September 11th and the firefighters. I will cover my cross in it and then create rubble around the base. I want people to remember. I want people at the art exhibitiono to go: 'Wow. I remember that. That piece is really good, I'm impressed.' I remember at last years exhibition someone did a 9/11 piece. It created many a comment.

       I quite like these new community police, they are quite helpful and seem to be doing a great job. When we went up to London on Monday on a coach we drove the whole length of where Croydon is - it really does go quite a long way until it becomes London; but anyway, I saw about 10 of them and half of them were talking to people and doing things. Fortunately I haven't had to talk to a police man for quite a little while, but I hate this racist issue. The press seem to think that every single person in the Met is racist and say they should get more black officers. In case you haven't noticed, you can't advertise specifically for that kind of thing as that is racist. The whole thing has to much PC behind it and I hate it all. I am quite intilted to say what I am about to say as it is a view, a belief, an experience and is true, but there are more black people causing on-the-street crime than white. This is true, and I know myself, all three of the blokes who mugged me where black; and their ain't that many black people wondering around Sanderstead village at 4pm on a Tuesday afternoon in January. So, my point is, the whole thing about stop-and-search being done to more black people than white seems fair to me entirely. I know a police man, in fact I know three, but this one in particular was talking to me about this issue when he worked for Croydon police, and white people do more robbery from houses and other non-violent crime, where as black people do more violent crime. The problem is, there is more violent crime around at the moment. Point made.  Another thing that is really annoying me at the moment is the 'new look' BBC News 24. It's rubbish. The idea of this channel was to become different from all the other 24 hour news channels, to be unique - which it was. Now it looks even more like Sky News which I despise, they are all following the horrible American TV which is truly terrible. BBC Three is dropping the only show I watch on that channel, Liquid News, and instead they had Johnny Vaughn with that chat show he did, which again is identical to these American ones where the audience clap whenever the presenter says a word that has 3 or more syllables in it. So I'm not impressed with the BBC at the moment - although I have been listening to Radio 4 quite a lot recently, I'm turning into an old man.  Oh yeah, one more thing (maybe). Today, while in HMV, browsing my way through the CDs, two blokes next to me, having a chat. Normal everyday things people do; but what are they doing while talking to each other? Holding their penis. Really, you know it's there, you probably saw it this morning when you were getting changed, do you really need to hold it all the time? I know it sticks out a bit, but you can buy special underwear that holds it in if you have those kind of problems. If you're afraid it's going to fall off, don't worry, this is the 21st century, we can glue it back on. But seriously, stop holding your cock, it just isn't right, especially when you're talking to another bloke, and in public.  I watched the Railway Children today, and it made me realise how much PC we have in this world today. It is so stupid it's not true. Signs everywhere telling us what to do and what not to do. Don't stick your head out the window. Don't jump off the cliff. This packet of nuts contains nuts. In the movie, the children are allowed to go out, run around the place, be happy, explore. Now, they would have to be with an adult and wouldn't be able to go and talk to the station master. Alright, East Croydon isn't exactly the best place, but smaller ones like Sanderstead and this wonderful little station in North Wales I went to. The village has about 10 houses in it, and the station is so small you have to ask the train driver to stop at the station when you get on the train; and wave your hand when you see the train coming to stop it.  I'm worried about Jo. She said something about her PC not working, so I can understand her not being on MSN or blogging; but I've text her earlier today and no reply. Hope all is well, anybody heard from her?  Blimey that's a long blog. Need to have a nap now.

       Ok so no one is blogging. Lets have a discussion.  Police. The British police. Croydon police. What do you think?  Asking this because it comes up every bloody general studies lesson and I am putting together my argument about it so that next lesson I can have my say.

       My hand has gone kinda numb this morning and was hurting yesterday. As I won't be at the doctors anytime soon I thought I'd look up what I have on the internet. It may be wrong but I think this is pretty much hitting the nail on the head.    Description  Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when tendons in the wrist become inflammed after being aggravated. A tunnel of bones and ligaments in the wrist narrows, pinching nerves that reach the fingers and the muscle at the base of the thumb. The first symptoms usually appear at night. Symptoms range from a burning, tingling numbness in the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers, to difficulty gripping or making a fist.    Treatment  Carpal tunnel syndrome is treated by immobilizing the wrist in a splint to minimize or prevent pressure on the nerves. If that fails, patients are sometimes given anti-inflammatory drugs or injections of cortisone in the wrist to reduce the swelling. There is also a surgical procedure in which doctors can open the wrist and cut the ligament at the bottom of the wrist to relieve the pressure. However, only a small percentage of patients require surgery.

       That's a rather unfortunate acronym, kind of ironic as well.  I haven't blogged for quite a while, nearly two weeks. What have a done? Not a lot really. I've been listening to Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas quite a lot, which is quite odd because it's not my normal taste in music, but I really like this song; and I have been introduced to Sugarcult who just rock. Rather stressed with the amount of work I have to do, but it's nearly holiday time, only two weeks left, so I'm not too worried. It's my birthday on Saturday, having a driving lesson which should be amusing! Bought my Christmas cards this evening with Jo & co in Oxted (haha, that rhymes).  So a mix of really good and really bad things - I supose they level out.

GCSE Certificates are okay now, they were posted to me yesterday and I got em when I come home.  3 things that I think are totally different from each other: I love... (example: "I think she has a really kind nature that I like") I fancy... (example: "Rah! She's well fit!") I like... (example: "Aw, ur nice") Don't quite know how to put that one.

       That Max is why you want a nice four wheeler. Camden was so good today. In fact all of today was good. Paul is so fab.  I am presuming Jo is not posting deliberatly. Well if there is no word from her by end of week I will remove her from blog and we can invite someone else to join. I leave the choice of who to add into blog up to you guys as I think that is what will happen as Jo is being childish.  Tom - your views on the subject of workload?

       Technology: sometimes useless. Example:  10 minutes ago there was this car trying to get up my road. Its not a particularly steep hill, but nethertheless, this big brand new PHAT BMW was trying its hardest to climb the snowy road. Anyhow, it was doing this outside my house for a good 15 minutes. Along came an old, battered Citroen AX or something and went up the hill just as if it wasn't snowing. Useless car designs.

       Ah well that then brings back the question about technology that Max said. Is todays technology like computers, broadband etc.. distracting us from what we SHOULD be doing or is it really just a matter of choice? I personally don't think the workload is too much overall. Its more down to finding the time to cope with it. I for one cannot cope at the moment what with the mocks coming up. I have a 5 hour art exam this Friday and I don't have a clue what I'm doing. Ihave a 5 hour textiles exam next Wednesday and no idea what I'm doing. Add that to Eng Lit where we have to memorise literally the whole novel of 'Enduring Love' as it is not allowed into the exam with us and gelogy of which I do not have a clue. Plus general studies which I don't have any guesses as to what will happen. Its too much. Not too much work just too much pressure to have it at such a high standard even though it needs to be at that high a standard for alevel.

       Work was not busy at all today. It was good. But now I have many a task for this afternoon. Hamlet essay, art, textiles. More art. More textiles. I have my art exam all day Friday. Eek!  I'm really happy atm. Probably because of Paul. I've got a hair appointment for the day of the Valentines Ball in London so I'm gonna have gorgeous straight hair :) I hope you all like, well, those of you that go. You should come, as a large group, it'll be a good night out I reckon.   And you are allowed to bring people from outside of school so bring people!!  I'm also looking to the cinema tomorrow. Scary Movie 3! Wohoo!!  Jackie, would you like to post the subject / question this week?

       Ooo I wonder where Jo's posts went. Isn't that a mystery.  I'm getting fed up of college. No real reason. I want to stop for a while. Have fun and relax. Time doesn't stop so oh well, its just a thought. My social life is slowly starting to pick up again. LOL. Cinema this weekend, Camden on Wednesday and then the Valentines Ball (hopefully) on the 17th.  Wohoo!

       We are a lazy soceity, the rate of obestitiy proves it! 30- 40 yrs ago there wernt T.V's and computers so children went outside to play EVERYDAY, not once a week for 10 mins but they would spend all day outside just playing and mucking around Because all of this new stuff is around children dont do anything, and aldults are just as bad! I'm not saying that i dont agree with all this new technology as it makes life a lot easier and conviente. But what i think needs to happen is control over what is used by parents ect..

       Now Jo thats just silly and how can you be boycotting this blog if your still posting?   Anyway. Lazy society hey? Well. I think the introduction of this ne wmodern technology has completely changed the way we live. Its faster to do things etc... Unfortunatly people are becoming more lazy with dirving to work instead of walking, phoning a friend instead of going around to see them etc.. But on the other hand with this technology being available shouldn't it be up to that person to decide if they use it, or if they don't? I think most of London certainly are getting lazier. Very much so.

       Yes and no. In some cases it has made life easier: i.e: Typing a letter. Thats how it should be. But now we have these super fast PC's *ahem* that play games and scan in our math h/w and it'll do it all for us and spellcheck it.  Phones are lazy as well, whatever happened to the phonebox?  This is the way I see it: It is making society lazier. But I like it somewhat, as long as it isn't expensive for its purpose. For example, a smartphone (costing 500) is enough for me to build a nippy mid-class PC, which I think has more use than the smartphone, plus its cheaper to run. On the other hand, a phone costing 100 range is fair enough.

       OK Jackie, in that case  Tom  can post this week.  Jo, no one said don't grow up just when your blogging when we're havinga  discussion about a topic can you not do it in a supier way. It seems to be that just because you go to Oxted you appear to me automatically more intelligent than us. Your not. Maybe you know more about certain subjects than us do but we're bound to know more than you do in the ones we study.  I get the felling when your blogging away its: 'You can't have that opinion because you don't know the ins and outs so you better change your mind' and then proceed to give us all a full lesson in politics etc...  So this week so should be interesting. I missed my textiles deadline for Friday last week so I should've done all the work over the weekend but I didn't because of work and the fact my sister came home. Work on Sunday was insane. The health and saftey officier decided to pay us a visit in the afternoon so I spent all morning running around cleaning stuff, making asiles safe, helping to clear up stock room. I also had to sweep up all of the trash outside to clear the fire exit. Yuk! I spent last hour or so in the canteen clearing that up and then the entertainment room. It was crazy.  And when I got home I realised I had left my posters by my locker. Darn.

And 6th form is college, its just that it is attachted toa skool! We get the same sorta amrks as colleges so it dnt matter! And nicki U cnt have paul cause ur mineeeeeeeeeeee

       FOR FUCKS SAKE ITS JUST A FUCKING PLACE TO LEARN STUFF. Look, definitions of it:   College  An undergraduate division or school of a university offering courses and granting degrees in a particular field.  IE: SIXTH BLOODY FORM  AAAAAAAAAH. Now I have been getting the feeling recently Jo that you don't seem to be liking me right now. Whenever we've had discussions on here you seem to love writing paragraphs about how wrong I am and you seem to like to point out your intelligence by bringing up facts etc... Just because I do Art and Textiles doesn't mean I don't know my own opnion. I don't need facts and figures to base my thoughts on. And so what if we go to Sixth Form which happens to be at Warlingham? It is a college, its not better or worse than anywhere else.  And I'd rather you wouldn't post random comments about Paul and Charlene or whoever because you will start to put thoughts into my head and I will start to panic so could you possibly refrain from doing so. That and remember we're not stupid so can you not talk to us as though we are. Or me. Or to anyone else who feels simlar.  Yes I am in an annoyed mood today.

       Its still a college though. Maybe its a bit more set or whatever but its still a college. I prefer Warlingham to going somewhere like East Surrey. Its pretty damm good.  Paul is loverly :)

<date>16,January,2004</date>
<post>

    
       How I think of it:  College = East Surrey. No specific times you have to be in. Not ajoined to secondary school. Specific classrooms for specific purposes. Pretty 'loose' campus. 6th Form = Warlingham. Specific times set. Joined onto secondary school. Must follow main school rules. Uses normal secondary school rooms.

       Warlingham has been a college since the Sixth Form begun. That is why it is: Warlingham Sixth Form. Sixth Form being collage. Sixth Form being another name for college.  Plus I prefer to say college than school.  Still an excellent Sixth Form. Nowt wrong with it.

        With the NHS in the state that it is currently in, should they be forced to treat people, like smokers, who bring illness upon themselves? And what about hypochondriacs who waste valuable space? Should they be treated?    I think with the NHS they should simply take a step back, look at themselves and then sort themselves out. There must be a logical way to sort out the long lists etc... somewhere. Hypochondriacs - well ok so they do waste space, sometimes. Maybe sometimes what they say is true. But they are still entiled to hospital visits. Perhaps it should just be a case of making doctors etc.. more efficent so that they can spot these people, check them out throughly but get them out quickly. Smokers - I don't like smokers. I hate it. Its the thing itself I hate but the people I dislike are todays generation. They all know the risks, they all know it could kill them yet they still go ahead. They are dumb. But those from our parents generation and before, they didn't know and now they do they can't stop. Its a fair argument. Its hard to quit it if you've been smoking for years. They should be entilted to free health care. It isn't their fault. Techically it is for smoking something that is damaging but they didn't know. My gran died from lung cancer and brain tumor. Created by smoking. I had to watch her die and I wish something could've been done about it but it couldn't. I don't blame her for smoking, I don't even blame the cigarette itself. I blame the fact that back then, she didn't know. Maybe it was cool, maybe it wasn't. Maybe it's just something they all did but the fact is she didn't know the dangers, couldn't give it up. Thats fair. Wish she'd have known, wish she would've stopped but hey, I can't do anything about it now.   But back to the question in hand.  Smokers should be given free health care. There should also be more warnings etc.. for us today. Maybe we should even take a lead of out Dublins book and become a city where you are not allowed to smoke in public. In your own home etc.. fine but not in public.  Then again. If your mum or dad had been smoking and you believed they shouldn't get free health care because its their choice, what if they became ill and weren't allowed in hospital. Even though something could be done to save them? You'd have to watch them suffer, maybe die. Its not nice. Would you still feel the same way? Even if they didn't know the risks at the time?

       Many apoglogise to Jackie, I didn't mean any harm by that - it was, as Max said, very different years ago.  I wish I lived back then as well. For example, my favourite quote from Richard Branson's autiobiograhpy... "If nobody was working very well in the office we would all go out for a walk in Hyde Park. Somebody would fall in the lake and we would all go for a swim."  Can't do that any more. Bloody politcal correctness.

       Tom was probably generalising, meaning more detailed methods should go into practice, like beginning the year the campaign ads started or something.  There is something that I am wondering about though. Back in the 60's and before hand or whatever, we had no such things as AIDS or HIV or any of that rubbish. So what the f*** has happened to society?  The government are getting worse as we speak, go fascism and conservative. The world today is piss. I would have loved to live back in the 80's. I could have gone to college and expected something good to be on the radio instead of something crap. Thats just going off topic now.  NHS sucks, pity I have to live with it. I'm gonna wrap myself in cotton wool and try not to break my neck or anything.

       What you to have just said has really offended me, both my mother and father smoke, they started smoking when the dangers wernt known, and then got addicted So you 2 are saying that my parents shouldnt get any help if they go to hospital with a smoking related illness. THat in my opinion is FUCKED UP You 2 are probably coming from the point of veiw that neither of your parents smoke there fore it doesnt affect you, my parents still pay taxes and shit so why shouldnt they get health care for free? Bah And thoses so called hpercondriacs, well if they are known then they will be left until last on the waiting list evct, and for all you know thoses hypercondraites could have something seriously wrong with them, all they are doing is caring about their health. Gah, im in a really bad mood today so excuse the language But grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Boys are stoopid and should go to jail

       I've thought about this for many years, and I've always believed that you should only get free health care if it's not your fault. If you've been run over by a bus, sure, come on in, get it sorted. Been smoking for last 5 years and you can't breath? Money please. That seems fair to me. I have a jaw problem, it ain't my fault, it's just the way I was born - therefore I should be intitled to free health care. The only problem then is that people will start making things up and you'll get even more problems.  If you've got a problem, you've got a problem. I still don't understand how people can think they have a problem they don't, if anything it's usualy the other way round, there should be more people in hospital. Anyway, it does happen and I think people like that should be given little DIY hospital kits to take home and they can sit in their own bed and get their friends and family to play doctors and nurses.  I'm nuts.

       Well well well. I will find it hard to top Tom's rave but I will try.  Since we've been back at college this term I've been feeling sick. More sick each day. Then along some Friday and I can't do anything at school because I'm so busy trying not to be sick. So I get sent up but my form tytor. I come back at lunch thinking well I've had 3 hours kip so I shuld be okish now. I didn't make it to English. I sat in the common room trying not to be sick. I forced myself to textiles as I have a deadline next Friday and cannot afford to miss the lesson. Saturday. Didn't make it to work. Didn't do any work. Stayed in bed. Along comes Sunday. Made it to work for 2 hours then get sent home. Can't go to the cinema either, too ill.  Today I wake up thinking yea I feel better. Eat my breakfast. Bad move. I nearly throw up this time. Don't make it to school. I'm about to go to texiles in a moment simply because I have to do this work. I can't afford not to do it so matter how bad I feel. What really annoys me is the fact that I still haven't been sick! I wish I would be sick because then I'd feel soooo much better. Apparently there is a bug going around work anyway so hey, I'm definatly not making this up. The other annoying thing is on Sunday I could've Paul twice. But I didn't because I'm ill. Could've seen Paul for most of today. Can't. I'm ill. I hate being ill. Although it is rather nice when mum makes me soup and buys me jelly and things that are easy on the stomach. She even cut the crusts of my sandwiches. Marvellous.

       I can't sleep. I've tried sleeping on my back, I've tried sleeping on my front. Perhaps if I sleep on my right? No, I can see the clock now, counting down the hours. I'll sleep on my left. No, that doesn't work either. I'll read my book, a chapter or two. No, that didin't work. I'll listen to some relaxing music. Nope, that didn't help either. I'll go and get a drink of water. That was nice. I want some more water now. I can't sleep.  Let's have a moan about something. The music in our common room. First of all, nobody is really listening to it. When the hi-fi is taken away, everybody does what they always do which is chat. So even with music as loud as possible, everybody still chats; but the music is often so loud I can't hear myself think. Problem number two, the music that is played is shit. There is no other word that defines it, it just really is. Continus beats and some strange person talking over the top of it. So when the radio is put on rather than somebodies nasty CD, it's Kiss 100, which is also shit. Not as shit as some of the CDs people bring in, but still pretty shit. How about Radio 1? That plays music all day long that everybody will like. No? Alright, Capital FM? Too much pop? Alright, try Virgin. Not a chance; bunch of selfish bastards. Wait until the lower sixth become upper sixth, then we'll show 'em.  A thought has just come into my head. There are no real swear words. Let me explain; shit means poo, piss means just that, fuck means to plant a seed, wanker means to do that naughty thing boys do, bitch means female dog, bastard means your parents arn't married, prick means something sharp and pointy. There are no proper swear words! Even my own alternative, cabbages, means a green vegetable thing. I say we event a word that is purley for cursing with, a proper swear word. It has to be an all purpose word though, so it has to fit in the asterisks in the following: "**** off", "You stupid ******", "That's a load of ****", "Britney is such a *****", "I hate Justin, he's such a *******". So, all purpose, generaly insulting word; can't think of one, I'll try and go to sleep, I'm sure I'll think of something.

       Right ok I am here. Now I won't be able to reply with something full of facts and figures etc.. simply because I don't do any subject to do with stuff like that except general studies. And in general studies Max and I made a very sucessful presentation about it all. We came second in the polls. We voted for the communisits. I say send them to France simple because France - I dislike. Thats not a decent reason to say that I know but hey, thats me. Like I say before, I don't know that much about it all. I don't mind the seekers who happily pay there way and live quietly without causing problems. Thats fine. I understand about war countries and goverments pursuring people and stuff and yes its horrible for them which is why I say with the amount we'd save on the illegal ones being kicked out we could help those countries. Thats also a better way than sending in our army like Iraq. But hey, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I don't know all the ins and outs. I have no need to know really. Only time it bothers me is when I'm in Croydon and they're all around and its like ah get away. Yea, I guess what I'm saying is we should send the illegal immigrents away somewhere, anywhere, else and find another way of helping them.  Tomorrow  Jo  will be choosing subject/question.

People like Neil's grandmother, fine. They pay their way we are paying for their living expenses. They don't cause hassle but its just the ones who don't pay their way, who clutter up our country.  Liek I said before, simple solution: send them all to France.

       When you say immigrants, I am sure you mean illegal immigrants or illegal asylum seekers? If you want to kick out all immigrants you have to loose Neil. Neil's grandmother came over from India, she earns her living, she pays her taxes, she owns her own house. However, I do agree that illegal immigrants should not be allowed in the country, as it really is taking the piss now.  I have to disagree with point number 2. "Eighty-seven per cent of the population of England and 96 per cent of the population of Wales gave their ethnic origin as White British."  If they are going to come over here, they should speak English, they should get a job, they should earn a living not hang around Croydon late at night not doing a lot. If you thank that's mean, Croydon has higher amounts of Asian or black than the national average. For example, black or black British in Croydon is 13.3%, in the whole country 2.1%.   urlLink  Source: 2001 Census, ONS

       Reasons to kick immigrants out: - They take up valuable housing and jobs which could be taken by actual British people - True Brits are now a minority - They take our money, give nothing back  Think about the amounts of money we would save from husing and feeding them if we sent them away!! We may then be able to sort out our hospitals or provide more funding for police and things. Or with some of that money give it to the warn torn countries to help their people directly rather than sending them all here. They annoy me, I walk around Croydon and I feel uneasy. Partly because of the hoddlums around but partly because of them. I know they've come to start a new life etc... I know their countries may be war torn etc... but there are other ways of helping them. Soon Britian won't be Britain anymore.  Send them all to France. Let the French deal with them. They are a big enough country. That or at least make it a lot and I mean ALOT harder for them to get into this country.

       Hmm. Good question Max. I do not know the anwser to that but onoe good point about it is that at least when you go to foregin countries you get some great bargins. But also hopefully with the expenses of living here we shoudl be able to kick the immigrents out. Wohoo.  I am not a happy bunny. I have been up since 4. I cannee sleep.

       One of the reasons why everything seems so expensive, especaily compared to the USA, is because we earn so little... Average annual income in the United States of America: US$34,280 Average annual income in Japan: US$35,610 Average annual income in the United Kingdom: US$25,120  Bastards.  I just watched a really good movie called 'Live From Baghdad' about the CNN news team in the first Gulf War; a really interesting and quite amazing movie, it's around on TV at the moment, look out for it, it's worth it. On the subject of Baghdad; Nicki, for my Christmas/birthday present got me The Baghdad Blog by Salam Pax, who wrote about the war from the city last year. I never read it online, but the book is great. Also I got a rather interesting book about the Matrix; my brain can't cope with too many books at one time, so I'll tell you more about it when I start reading it. So thanks Nicki!  I'm going to find some ice cream, and perhaps eat it.

        This week's topic: Why is Britian so high priced?   In France I see a little girl of about 9 go up to the counter and buy a pack of ciggies for what I worked out to be 1.15. Gap in america was cheap, I got one of my favourite polo necks from the store for only 2.50. Leather goods are so much cheaper as well.  For example, I want to buy a new motherboard for my PC. The one I want costs 85 in England. In the SAME STORE, but in the USA, it is 55. Why???

       Yep, I'm home. Home home home. I've had a lovelly time, a good break to get away from the pressures that all of us have. If you want to hear all the boring details come and talk to me. So today, I went shopping. In London. I bought lots of things.  urlLink Eddie Izzard - Sexie  (DVD), very funny!  urlLink Sugarcult - Start Static  (album), very good!  urlLink Black Eyed Peas - Shut Up  (single), just because that song's cool. I also bought a nice pair of jeans for 20 reduced from 50 in Gap - not bad at all! The main thing I went in for I didn't get because it's "out of season", grrrrrr. When I want to buy something, I want to buy it now, not when it's sunny, you silly people. Still, I also bought  urlLink Ministry of Sound Very Best of Chillout Sessions  which is very relaxing. So now, I'm off to bed.

       Taking a leaf out of Tom's mighty book I replace the word fuck or fucking with the word: cheese or cheesy.  So ner Matt NEEEEEEEEEEEER. And ner ner ner to the rest of the cheesy world. And whoever creates the Strong Bad website should be cheesy well shot alongside cheesy Chaucer for not creating a characters page for the cheesy brilliant 'eh steve' who was introduced to me tonight by Benjamin. Woo go Ben. Now I am in a cheesy cheesed off mood for many a reason. In fact my stupid cheesy mood has made me have a go at Charlene for no real cheesy reason and now I feel cheesy well bad about it so sorry to anyone I have bitched to today my apologies.  And I was going to write pages and more cheesy pages but to be honest I can cheesy well be cheesed.

       Croydon is a London Borough and is in the county of Surrey. Croydon is a town and so has a council. I live in Sanderstead, which is part of Croydon. Nicki lives in Hamsey Green, which is part of Croydon. Warlingham School is outside Croydon (by about 5 metres) and so is part of Surrey County Council. That is why we get Surrey ambulances at school and a mix of Surrey and MET police.  However, northern Croydon stops being Surrey and is part of the county of London, although never written like that. The City of London is actually quite small and covers between Westminster Bridge and Tower Bridge (or there about). The Queen, for example, does not live in the City of London, but lives in London.  The centre of London, such as Westminster and the City is very different. London then technically speaking becomes a county and Westminster is a City within London, hence the signs saying "City of Westminster". The towns around London, within Greater London, are part of the counties they are in, but the MET control the whole of Greater London.  However, Thornton Heath, which is in Croydon, is in the Surrey part, but it has a London postcode: SE19. However, other parts of Thornton Heath are in the Surrey part of Croydon and have CR7 for their postcode. Most of Surrey has Croydon postcodes; those living in Warlingham and Caterham with CR6 will know.  London Gatwick airport is quite far south in Surrey, but is London's second airport, with Heathrow being first. Gatwick is confusing because it spans Surrey and West Sussex - the airport being in the latter.  There are also constituencies to worry about as well. Warlingham School is in Tandridge, with Croydon to the north and Mid Sussex to the south. This is how the governments look at their national statistics. However, the constituencies within that are broken down even more.  I get BBC LDN for my local news, as I receive cable from Croydon and terrestrial from Crystal Palace (which is another town, although not very big, but is part of Croydon). People living in Tandridge should receive BBC South East as their local news  but I do not think any of us live that far to reach that news.  According the BBC and the office for National Statistics, Croydon is in London and Tandridge is in the South East.  My address is officially: Sanderstead, South Croydon, Surrey  because, on a map, that is exactly where I am.  There.

       Croydon is covered by the met police. I agree.  But then again I have an address saying "Croydon, Surrey" from my work experience. Its by thw Whitgift Centre. Surely can't be that not up-to-date can they?

<date>23,February,2004</date>
<post>

    
       No Tom! Grr. LOL.  MATT: Technically Croydon is still London you fool. The council works differently. Croydon used to be a part of Surrey but it isn't anymore. Yes I know on peoples addresses they say Surrey like mine does but that is because its on the border. Plus there is a road the same name as mine in Croydon itself so by putting Surrey they know which one.  Croydon is a London Bourough, its South London. Just very very South. It is covered by the Met police, not the Surrey police.

       Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls let us give a proper El Bloggo invite to Matt! *silence* Wooo! the friendliness! Hey Matt all ya do is blog away!!!!!! Talk about what you wish and things. Most Mondays / Sundays someone posts a subject to discuss all week. There are a few basic rules which are: a) no blatant or however it is spelt promo for a website (cough david t cough) and b) no excessive swearing unless your in an incredibly evil / mad / depressed mood. Fair? I think so.  Well the ball last night was fab. Jackie, Matt and Max, you sooooo should've come! It wasn't really valentines influenced at all in fact it was just like the leavers ball except it was on a boat and there wasn't as much food. But it was soo good. I got Dean to buy me a drink, go me. It was so fun. Paul looked so loverly :) Everyone looked so loverly. I went to bluewater today with Lisa and my rents. I got some new shoes! And a few other things so it was a sucessful day in all.   Right now I am going to go and collaspe onto my bed after I have tided the chaos that is my room as it is in mayhem from getting ready yesterday. Rah.

       I feel that having 6 people would be too crazy if everyone were to be posting. It would be too much to catch up. I think that 5 people are enough. For now anyway.  I don't think there is any need to make people apply seeing as this is just a blog as has been pointed out. Looks like its going to be Matt is everyone ok with that?

       I've done one exam this week. Technicaly two if you count general studies, but that doesn't really count. It was ICT and my hand got tired from writing, so combined with the fact that we walked into the exam blind having never seen an ICT AS paper I think I did pretty well; D if I'm lucky. Yay...  On to happy times.   Look what arrived today! Yay! I can listen to my tunes all day long.

       I think you should invite as many people as possible and see which people stand out and actually write something; so what if it's a frenzy of crazy stuff, it will be quite a contrast.  I don't like Rousseau, I think he's a bit of a ponce. And he's French, which doesn't help.

       Ok so this blog is really starting lag. Now I think it would be a good idea to add someone else in so please give me your suggestions and please blog.  Here is a statement I have found:  Man is born free but is everywhere in chains.  [Jean-Jacques Rousseau] Can you explain what Rousseau is saying here?

Hot dog life.  But don't hot dog Thorpe Park because I am really looking forward to that unless it is pouring down with rain. But then again I won't really hot dogging care.

       I know, lets discuss the great Britsh public. Why is it that the day when your all supposed to be home faffing around your mother, giving her presents etc... that instead the Britsh all come out to Woolworths? Why is it that people don't buy cards or presents until the day they are needed? Why is it that everyone is buying their mother either Calendar Girls or Love Actually?? Seriously! We'vce sold like 10 copies of LA today already!!!!!!! Aaaah!!!  The thing that is most insane about today is that our old manager Pam booked Charlene and Dean a day off today. They are both off. Leaving us with 4 people in house until 2 when Lora goes. Leaving us with 3. 3 people. 2 people to work 3 tills which we refuse to do because you need at least noe person running around when needed but at the same time we have to do the charts etc... AAAAAAAAAAH.

       When things like this happen it makes you question humanity.  And its a shame. It does need to stop. Completely. But it won't.  I am going to Spain in roughly 3 weeks. I hope everything is OK.   I have a dent in my head above my eye from where I hit my head on the corner of the corner seat yesterday. Grrr. Then i had to go to work. To do the delivery. But it didn't even turn up. Which is good because that means not much work this weekend. Hehe. But it meant I kinda wasted 2 hours (paid though) when I could've gone and joined in with the quiz night. Grr. Fine.

Nuria, Alcal de Henares, Madrid, Spain   I would like to send my condolences to all family's victims. I'll pray for them tonight. God bless them.  talo Cavalcanti, Fortaleza, Brazil   I can't believe it! All this horror! For what? When will it end?  Jonathon Tong, Madrid, Spain   Has anyone realised that the bomb blast in Madrid was on the 11th March, six months from 11th September. Is it coincidence, or perhaps a deliberate plan on the part of the terrorists?  Julie Oswald, Northumberland   As a person who grew up and lives in NYC, I wanted to let the people of Madrid, Spain to know that our prayers are with them.  Dennis Lee, New York, USA   My son age 16 called from Alcala De Henares to say he was ok. He is on a trip with 7 other students studying at the international school there for 2 weeks from Texas. Our small town in Texas sends our sympathy and our prayers for all the people and country of Spain. My son said it is a horrible tragedy like our 9/11 was to our country. We may be from different countries but we are all family created by our father. We are mourning now with you Spain.   Lynda Pohl, Belton, Texas U.S.A.   We just want peace and justice.

I thought yesterday lunch was quite funny with yet another fight which consisted of Bradley v me, Eddie and Colette. It was funny mainly becauise their argument consists of 'fuck off'. Nice. I had the best lunch today. I spent the whole hour cuddling Paul and it was so nice. :)  Jackie has new shoes!!!!!

       Matt has officially been removed now from this blog and I reckon at least 5 people would be better than 4 as not everyone blogs that much if you see what I mean so again if you have anyone you would like to join this nominate them.  I ust got in from work and I am sooo tired. I ache all over because I've been doing delivery today and its all very heavy. VERY heavy. Tomorrow I'm doing full day then 2 nights during the week. I would say gah but I actually volunteered for extra hours. Next Saturday I have swapped shifts so I'm working afternoon so I get a lie in. Woo! I feel so bad when I moan about feeling tired after a 4 hour shift. Well, 4 and half. Especially when people like Paul work all day! Like proper all day. Awww. I see Paul tomorrow. Wooo! :P

       Wooooooo! Discussion! People blogging! Wooooo!!!  Well I'll admitit, at teh begining of the year I really didn't mind Joe putting his CD's on, i didn't mind listening to kiss all day. I admit some of the songs were good. Even got my feet tapping away but now I'm totally against it all mainly because of the way its been handled. I wouldn't mind Joe putting his CD's on if he asked everyone first 'Does anyone mind if I change the CD?' or if he waited for the actual CD to finish but he doesn't. He just goes and turns it off whenever he pleases, like its HIS stereo and it isn't. Its everyones. I know poeple have different tastes, lok at my CD collection. I own a bit of everything. Pop, Rock, RnB, Soundtracks, Jazz atc... I don't mind what we listen to I just wish it was dealt with in a better way. But I agree, the best solutionis simply no stereo at all. When they took it away for a week the common room was so much better. You could hear yourself think, you could have conversation with people without shouting and no one got wound up for people changing the CD or radio station. Yes, I vote too,  Get rid of the CD player . If people want to listen to stuff they can bring in their own personal stereos.  I saw the drama plays last night. WOW. I am so proud of everyone who was in them :) Only thing that annoyed me slightly was that they decided to tell me as we were all leaving that I was invited to Pizza Express with them as the drama group were going. Grrr. Tell me a few days before and I can get money. Tell me five minutes before and gah. Ah well. That doesn't matter anyway, the plays were sooo good and I would say more but I have to go to work so byeee.

       I agree with Jackie; nobody really listens to it anyway, and most people have their own music anyway - it just causes problems. I think we should get rid of it, the atmosphere is always much more pleasant without it.

       Hm, I will listen to practically anything... But especailly Justin Timberlake! Tee Hee Joe's music to me is okay, but i dont want to listen to it everyday, the same goes for the kinda stuff the grungers listen to. I prefer pop type songs or ones with beats and lyrics, such as songs from blue, westlife, ect The problem is easy, get rid of the stereo, if someone wants to listen to music, play it in a personal player ect... simple

       My tastes in music vary, but only slightly. I like all kinds of 'rock'. Yes, it is classified under 'rock', but there are different styles like 'classic rock' (e.g. Beatles), nu-metal (Rage against the machine), Hard rock (e.g. Guns N Roses), progressive rock (Pink Floyd). I also like quite a bit of 80's stuff, including classic 80's pop tracks.  Now, the common room......I reckon the days should be spilt over the two weeks and divided into 'sections'. One music 'style' should be played per day. One being Kiss radio, one being rock that the majority of the grungers like, and the other 'defined' styles like Rap, House, Garage, Living room, utility room, bedroom, front porch, larder storage, or whatever other music like that there is.  Splitting is the only fair way to control both sides. By me saying 'both sides' I mean Joe vs. Simon/Charlie vs. Rest of 6th form. (using as an example because they have two completely different music tastes).  Also. What struck me is....that music that is always being played gets turned off or changed. For example, that Pokemon song, nobody turned it off and it has been played three times that I have heard. I reckon nobody turned it off because it was a CHANGE. Something that nobody has heard for ages.

       I like music. I enjoy listening to all music, considering the differences and appreciating the different styles around the world and in all the cultures. This is something which most people really cannot do as they live in their shallow world of only listening to one style of music, which quite frankly, bores me to tears. My brother and Paul have this habit in the mornings, getting ready to go to school, of only listening to rock, and if it is not rock or a song that they have not heard before or is not to there usual taste, will straight away change the channel. At all costs, they will watch Kerrang! or Q. If a song, for example like this morning, came on by Oasis then thats not rock enough for David and Paul so they want to watch something else. Both of them call all other styles of music crap, rubbish or just bad. It is not bad music at all, they just live in a shallow world.  How about listening to new music rather than sitting in your shallow musical worlds and listen to the other music out there? I do enjoy rock, I really have no problem with it, its one of my favourite styles, but I also enjoy all other types of music.  This kind of behaviour is very similar to Joe, he enjoys his particular type music; however Joe expresses it in the different manner: by inflicting it on the rest of the 6th form who really, do not care for it at all. I do not mind listening to Kiss (being the most popular in the common room), they play some good songs that obviously Virgin would never play. Most people seem to be happy, everybody has their personal favourite, but as far as pleasing as many as possible a combination of Kiss and Capital, with Virgin after school, seems to be fine.  However, Joes music is where  urlLink music , defined as  urlLink an artistic form of auditory communication incorporating instrumental or vocal tones in a structured and continuous manner  stops being music. His music gives me head aches, he always plays the same songs, and he doesnt give a flying fuck about what anybody else thinks. The continuous beats with some bloke who probably mugged some kid on the way to record the song. Joe does not even buy the songs; all those CDs are burnt and obviously the songs have been stolen through the Internet. If you support and enjoy music, buy the bloody song.  Tomorrow I am going to buy the Britney Spears single Toxic. Why? I like the song, it has a fabulous violin part, which is ringing around in my head, it has interesting lyrics, to me it is a good song, just like when I bought Shut Up by The Black Eyed Peas. If any of you think buying either of them is sad, pathetic, stupid, silly or whatever - you can go fuck yourself. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music and deciding on what I want to listen to, not what an industry wants me to listen to or sitting in a shallow world of a mono-style.

       So. This is an interesting conversation. . . .  Um yea so I went Croydon with Ben to give advice on presents he was buying. We had dinner at Pizza Hut which was cool. We had a giggle. Er what else. Um. Just had a wicked shower. Nice and waaaarm which was cool. Lol. Um, I miss Paul :( Lots of mayhem going on on msn atm. I should really go do some work. Gah. I am now working all day Sunday and probably some evenings after school next week. Most evenings actually. Which is good because of money and this time if I am knackered or whatever I'm just not going to moan because it annoys people so. Yea.  Good advice dudes: Listen to your heart. Yea.  Um seeing as no one is really blogging I'll post a subject thingy for now in case someone wants something specific to blog about:  The music problem in the common room

       Just to clarify I spent most of yesterday having a go at most people so don't feel hard done by. Yea I know you have work, so does everyone else but it only takes a few minutes to write a few lines. And both of you type fast so, um, yea.  But anyway. I have noticed that on tusedays when Paul is at work I actually come home and get on with work rather than sitting on msn until he comes on. LOL. So now I have nearly finished a wall hanging. Only 2 things left to finish for textiles which I should be able to do by Friday. But now I have about 3/4 pieces for art to finish so, um, pants.

You don't know what goes on in my life behind the name of   Max  eMac Fund: 322 of 756 - November Rain (http://www.maxpayne.co.uk)  so please don't have a go at me. Nicki knows the reasons why im not blogging why I should. I've told her and I've requested something to be done about it. It isnt my fault.  Other than I have blisters on the back of both feet from walking home all the time, i'm whoop-de-doo. Seriosuly.  The parents have stolen the computer room, meaning I am downgraded to the 400Mhz laptop. Pathetic. I need my own PC for my room. One that I can modify and build to my own specification without anybody hindering me in the process.

       Oh for fucks sake. Re-reading that it sounds like I am having a go at Paul for staying late. I'm not. Just better clarify that point. I'm not.  Ahhhhhhhh I wanna go beat someone. Ooo lets get Joe the flannelt wearer! He is really starting to pee me off. What a man bitch. Lets give him a bitch slap.   I have decided I want a mini. A proper nice mini, I want some mini adventures.  I have also decided that I can't be arsed to be unhappy anymore while actually at school because it just pisses everyone else off so I will be 'happy' and I won't annoy you all, that much. I say that much because I am sure I will annoy you at some point for some reasons and oh my gosh Tom is strong he can pick me up and carry me. He carried me across the common room earlier. So did Rudland. I was amazed.   But enough of that.  BRB I got chocolate to go get. . . . . . . . . . . . Ok I'mback and now I am eating chocolate which I shouldn't because eating chocolate makes you insanely fat. Well not you, me. I once wanted to be a model. Pah. Good dream that was. You gotta be thin to do that.  Fucking bloody quality street. I mean what a total rip off. They are tiny now. Not the good nice big one we used to get. Now they are tiny. Little fuckers.  I want the YMCA on cd because I want to go cheer myself up but I can't because I don't have it on CD and nor do I have Buttercup on cd and I can't be bothered to do much else except moan on here so you can put up with it.  Actually I can't even be bothered to moan now. I think I'm gonna go sit on msn and annoy whoever is online. Lets have a look.. Lisa. Nah I won't annoy her. Max. Oi Max blog biatch. Ant. Hmmm. I haven't spoken to him in a while. Maybe. Jason. Nah don't speak to him much. Jane. Nah. Although she is fun to annoy. Charlie. No I like Charlie. Me. No I won't annoy myself oh wait too late already have. Eddie. Nah. Too much effort that. Lora. Nah. an no one else is online because THEY ARE ALL DOING DRAMA. I really want to watch the Sound Of Music but my sister has the video so ahh. Maybe i will go watch Sister Act 2? Who knows??  Or maybe I will just sit here and FUME.

       ARRRRRRGH. Look people do you think you can blog? Otherwise there really is no point in this. I get the impression Tom you aren't happy now that Jo has gone because you blog like NEVER. And Max: your like online all the bloody time so just fucking blog. Am I in a good mood? NO I AM FUCKING WELL NOT. Its fucking freezing and I have been at school until 5 mins ago waiting for Paul who is STILL in drama and yes fine reherse but i have been there since fucking 3.35!!!!!! And now I am incredibly pissed off because I spent the last like half hour waiting as on actually waiting. Doing NOTHING. I had no homework left to do or anything and its just like ahhh. Why I am always waiting for other people?? This isn't directed at anyone, I just don't get why I am the one always waiting for people, waiting for everyone else Ack. And I haven't seen Paul today hardly. Lunch he was doing some prefect thing and then now hes still in drama so argh. So I am not impressed and I just want to see him but apparently not. So wopee. So tomorrow I think I may just sleep all of fucking lunch. Sorry for my language but I'm pissed off at many many things.  Have a good evening.

       Hi everyone, another exausting and fairly stressful week comes to a close. This week for me has contained good and bad days, so overall it was a boreing week, lots of reminders to do things i should have done 5 weeks ago. Is it me or is every teacher in the school currently having a go at 6th form classes??? Grrrrrr makes me angry, and then this morning i walk into school and who is waiting for me at the door, that lovly lady, Miss SHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just waiting to pounce on me and have a go for missing her lesson, grrrr. Anyway a nice long weekend to follow. I want to propose a rule that no one does any school related work on bank holiday Monday? anyone with me? Well i am sorry this isnt very exciting today, talk to you all soon, have a briliant long weekend. Oh the life moto thing,  'Expect the best, but prepare for the worst' Dave

        If you want a job done properly, do it yourself.  I would never let my Dad perform maintenance on these PC's, as he would bugger it up before you can say 'cheese'.  A massive W00T because Waitrose have kept me on file from January when I applied, and they are now recruiting and have chosen me and a few other people to attend an interview on Saturday at 2:30.  Have yet another computer upgrade request from a girl called Eolie in year 11. Another w00t. Selling my AIO printer for 30. W00t again.  The course I want to take at university will be one of: (BSc) Computer Architecture And Design (BSc) Computer Systems Engineering (BSc) Computer Systems  Sometimes they are Hons, sometimes they are not. Pff.

       I don't really have a motto, and anything I do tend to say a lot, I usually steal ou of songs. Just general inspiring things. Here's one of my favourites. Its more a speech really, but I love it:  "Everyday a man wakes up And everyday a man tries to pour himself a cup of coffee, And take a good long hard look in the mirror. Sometimes what he sees in that mirror he doesn't like, And sometimes what he sees makes him angry,  and sometime what he sees makes him sad. Sometimes what he sees is himself And that dissapointment just gets into you and rips you out, Little be little, piece by piece.  And sometimes you can just lay down You can just play the game You can take the cards that they deal you And you can just pretend it's all over... ....BUT NOT ME"

       I know your all busy but could you guys do a quick post please. Thanks.   What is your motto and why?  Mine is 'it's never as bad as being shot in the neck, unless you have been shot in the neck'. Why? Because I watched a program and it showed someone as they were and then after they had been shot in the neck and it is horrid. You take a while to die, they can't save you (depending where bullet is but higher percentage of not saving), and you die a slow death by drowning in your own blood. It's horrid so it can't be as bad as that.   What about you all?

       Well actually Tom, that isn't the course at that uni I was looking. And I  do  need to do a foundation course because that if how you build up a decent portfolio and please stop trying to tell me I'm wrong. I am quite happy with the way I am handling it, I have spoken to my art teacher and she actually said do the foundation course because you get to experience new arts and stuff.  If you say any more about it without me asking you do you know this or do you know that I'm gonna get really annoyed even though I already am quite annoyed because I don't appreciate people telling me me own ideas especially when you don't even want to do fashion design or something along those lines I think I would know a little more about the fashion courses. Sorry if that sounds rude but this term I am very pissed off at people copying my ideas and trying to tell me what to do. I am my own person you know. I can do stuff myself without people telling me or then copying me.

        urlLink BA (Hons) Fashion Design  Entry requirements: A good portfolio plus  one  of the following:  Successful completion of a foundation course in art and design together with five GCSE passes at grade C or above.  A merit profile at BTEC National Diploma level in a relevant subject together with five GCSE passes at grade C or above.  240 points at A/AS and/or Vocational Advanced level qualification. Candidates will normally have successfully completed two 6-unit qualifications or an appropriate 12-unit Vocational Advanced qualification (AVCE). The School does not usually accept General Studies as a qualification.  Equivalent qualifications or experience.  As you can see Nicki, you  don't  need to do a foundation course.

       Actually Tom I  do  need to do a foundation. I have looked at the courses I want and they all require a portfolio and a foundation dipolma thing some of which the unis actually allow you to do there and then go on to the course so actually Tom for me personally it is not optional and when I asked them about it they said you could apply without a portfolio but you'd have a much better chance of getting in with one seeing as one of the courses only has 45 places on it so yes, I do need a foundation course and portfolio. I can't even remember what the unis are. Only one I can remember is Nottingham Trent uni.  Cool Jackie I was planning on wearing a skirt as well!!! Lol. So hey we can be skirt buddies? lol. What skirt is it? Short skirt? Long skirt? Denim?

       Er right Tom... No problem Paul :p Max, you deserved it.   The Butterfly Effect , sunday, films starts at 6.00. See you in the screen if you wish you come.  So I got the weekend off. Yay! I spent today cleaning my room and looking through the "propecti" (LOL). Gah. If I choose to do an art or fashion course I have to do a foundation diploma degree thingy. Which is good because I'll have an extra qualification but still. Gah.

Its pretty crazy. Was pondering buying one myself and bringing it to school as stress exam relief. Could work could work.  So the vending machines are sold out and don't work. Thats like not good.

       Hi, Tom - i can tell you the three digit firgure was over 100.  Nicki - in order to lay this whole gay thing to rest, i think we can come to the aggreement that the use of the word is wrong, when in the context of a way of describing something which is bad.  My day has been pretty depressing compared to the great holiday, but thats life. Hopefully tommrow will be better. talk to you all soon Dave

       The word  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  springs to mind.  Now I believe I have mentioned the fact that my computer died and wiped all my work off including work shadowing letters? Well. The printer wasn'tworking this morning so I stayed after school to write the letter on the comps there but of course all our passwords were changed to numbers and I don't know my number so I couldn't get in so I am attempting to write it now but my computer is being very tempermental so lets beat it up. Yuss!

I have now got 4 fucking pieces of fucking coursework to be finished by the end of next week. So I probably won't be talking much on msn. Today was crap, I want the summer holidays to come!  And I wish them bloody kids would stop setting the fire alarm off.

       This whole 'gay' thing. I get pissed off when people say it as well, I know lots of gay people, some get annoyed others don't. I don't mean to offend anyone but I've given up pointing out exactly what you point out because no one listens and no one stops saying it. Its not as if I sit there and actually mean the computer is homosexual. Blame it on the society we live in today. Everyone says 'proper good' and 'gay' as general terms now. I really don't think people are out to annoy you. So sorry for saying it but my computer really is the most annoyinly bitch ever. IT NOW TURNS ITSELF ON RANDOMLY. WTF is up with that???? So bad to start to a worse day. I couldn't find half my book sthis morning and paniced. Wooooooooo! I have a full days of lessons today, I am supposed to bring all my stuff in but to frank with you I cannot physically carry 3 folders, 3 sketch boks and about a hundred other random books in because I will DIE.

       Hi, Its late, and i am not gonna write a full essay. a couple of things i would like to bring up. Paul - If you wanna argue about it, then we will arrange to meet up some time and i will quiet happily go into it further. Crispy - i put on 3 pound, and my dad put on 4! Today i went to work on some lights at AMF, i have just finished typing their invoice which (i cant say the amount online) but i have made a 3 digit figure, lump sum out of my work there, and i am very happy. After i finished there i went to waynes and spent some time with him, fixed a computer came home, typed stuff for AMF. Looking forward to school which starts in 8 hours from now!!! Brilliant stuff. Talk to you all soon. Dave

       Dave- calling something gay is really no different from calling someone a bastard... it doesn't mean that they are really an illegitimately born child does it? And I'm sure people who were really born when their parents weren't married aren't gonna take offence at the term

       Well I should of gone into school today to hand in coursework. But considering I haven't finished it I thought I better not. I will finish it today and hand it in tomorrow. She can't get that angry at me because I know some people arn't handing it in until tomorrow anyway.  I have got to babysit tonight which means an extra 5 to spend, Although I just remebered I owe Nicki 2 or 3. As she brought me a train ticket and I never paid her the full ammount back.  I had a huge fright this morning because my mum phoned from work saying are you sure you haven't got school. Now I was thinking that the teacher I was seeing today had phoned up, but in fact all it was, was that when my mum drove to work she saw all of the cars in the school car park. Forrtuantly I told her all the teachers had to go in, so the scare was avoided.  To david- I wonder whether you put on any weight? And also what did you spend your winnings on? I hope it was something for me.  Wow, I can't beleive I am making such huge posts recently! Maybe it's because I am putting off doing work if I type long things?

       Hi everyone, After having a great time reading your posts I have a few comments to make, One - Nicki - Computers are as of yet mechanical devices, they do (supposedly) what we tell them to, there is no way in the world that your computer or any other computer could be homosexual. I get fairly pissed off when everyone uses gay as a term for something people don't like, WHY DO IT. I know loads of gay people, and i know it offends some of them, and I don't think its fair. (sorry if it seems like I am having a go, don't mean to) Two - Paul (and anyone else who don't know) - I do now have a girlfriend (believe it or not) She is called Becky Aspland, I have been with her for about a week, she goes to Archbishop Tennisons, is nice, what else can I say?   Ok now on to my day, my plan for today was to get up early sort out the 100000000 hours worth of coursework I had to do and sort out my life, a very time consuming activity. However as life is life, things didn't go to plan, not at all. I got up at 10:30 sort early compared to 2pm. So instead of doing work I played Transport Tycoon,  Then I decided I should eat (here's the start of the most stupid thing I have done for ages) My mum decided she would make me and my dad a fry up, we had too much bacon (I don't know why?) so she gave me and my dad 5 'bits' each, as we ate it we talked about weight watchers (which my mum does) we discovered that me and my dad would only be able to eat 18 points each day, my mum worked out how many would be in our breakfasts, and then we decided to keep a track of everything we ate today, this stupidly soon turned into a competition, however not who could stick to 18 but who could eat the most points during today. Well this has got really out of hand, we are both nearly throwing up at each move we make but are still eating to try and win the massive 1 reward. ITS VERY SILLY DON'T DO IT. Anyway now I am watching 'what lies beneath' actually I am not I am watching, my brother watching 'what lies beneath' (he is scared!!!!!!!)  Anyway have got to go prepare my equipment for tomorrows, low work, high pay, work at AMF. Looking forward to that one, but now looking forward to waking up at 8:30, Anyway hope everyone is good, (sorry if I have wrote loads,don't wanna strain anyone's eyes or something like that)  See you all soon, Dave

       I guess I should blog really as I haven't for the past few days. Its possibly because I am addicted to www.habboforum.com at the moment. Not something I am proud of.  As yet I have done no school work, which means tongiht and tomorrow I have an awful lot of work to do. I have three peices of coursework to be done and numerious peices of homework. I have done no revision or even looked at any of my work.   I feel that I may be retaking my exams... the fact is, I have no urge to do any work. To me it is boring and I always find better things to do, such as habboforum.  The holidays have been quite good, Been to Thorpe park, Brighton and the cinema, But thats about it. I would of liked to go to the cinema  again, but most people either can't be bothered to come, have no money, or they have too much work to do.  One last thing, I have now recieved my skirt for work, so I am now wearing a skirt, If you wish to laugh go ahead. Fortuantly i may be allowed to wear trousers as we had a little talk about equal opportunities and equal rights... :D  So this is my blog, I may not blog much for the rest of the week as I will be extreemly busy finishing off coursework and doing homework. Goodbye.

       She doesn't mean disabled people driving silly. I doubt you're going to spend 1 hour in a disabled toilet, so I guess it's alright to use for a quick piss.  The sex thing: because it's mucked up, like all the other 16/18 laws.  Right, remember the Music Video thing? Well there is now a Web site for it at  urlLink www.snooboo.com/musicvideo . This is mainly directed at Paul, but everybody else is welcome to make suggestions and things.  snooboo.com Forum as well as a lot of other snooboo.com things all got mucked up while I was away, which isn't much fun.  Anywho, back to blogging; I found this on CNN:  urlLink Strangest taxes . This one is the best: Illegal drug tax: At least 11 states, including Alabama, North Carolina and Nevada, tax people who possess illegal drugs. Usually, though, you have to be in possession of a minimum quantity (for example, over 42.5 grams of marijuana in North Carolina) to be subject to the tax.  But no need to wait for the police to cuff you before you cough up the cash. In North Carolina, for instance, when you acquire an illegal drug (or even "moonshine"), you can go to the Department of Revenue and pay your tax, in exchange for which you'll receive stamps to affix to your illegal substance. The stamps serve as evidence you paid the tax on the illegal product.  Don't worry that you might get in trouble for admitting you have enough drugs to fuel a rave party for years. You needn't provide any identification to get the stamps and it's illegal for revenue employees to rat you out.  Still, according to North Carolina's department charged with collecting the unauthorized substance tax, only 77 folks have voluntarily come forward since 1990. Most of them are thought to be stamp collectors. (Or perhaps they were just high?)  The majority of the $78.3 million the state has collected thus far has come from those who got busted and were found without stamps.  But even if they had had stamps, it's not like their legal troubles would be over. "Purchasing stamps only fulfills your civil unauthorized substance tax obligation," according to the N.C. DOR Web site. Only in the strange land that we call America.

       I didn't know you had a girlfriend Dave. Who is she?  Right, answering Nicki's question about disabled people, I guess its more dangerous for a disabled person to be behind the wheel of a car than it is for them to be on a toilet. Although that said, look at how Elvis died. Toilets are dangerous creatures they are  Here's a question:  At the age of 16, you are legally allowed to have sex, yet cannot watch images of a strong sexual nature on film until you are 18. Why?

       Hiya, Nicki - Sounds great although around school shows things often get a bit tense. But as long as you can stand everyone in a stress and the boss lady thinks its ok then cool.  Paul - I have seen the way you look at me  Right, today i took out my girlfriend to Croydon, we looked in strange shops then went to pizza hut, then went to see 50 first dates, (was fairly good but was one of them typical films where you can predict the end from the start!) Then i went to her house to 'meet the parents' and i dont think i should make a comment about that so publicly. Anyway then when i got home wayne gave me a call and said do ya wanna come bowling so i said yea course. So then i had to go back to gf 'Becky's house and pick her up then we spent the evenign bowling. Just got home, didnt win, far from it. (i am sure it was a computer related problem and nothing to do with how i bowl) Anyway most of you seem to be writing short messages, and i can really go on when i want to so i think i will now finish, (you dont all wanna know about my strange and mucked up life) So looks like i am gonna watch the rest of this film (on BBC1, not bad actually, comic moments) Then go to bed, hope you are all well, and see you all tuesday!

       Yay! Hi Dave *waves*. We discovered blogger doesn't like hotmail or hotmail doesn't like blogger. One of the two. Oh yea, I had a brainstorm. When the school play is on if you want, I could always come and keep you company on the balcony..each night. Then I could like watch Paul each night....and keep you tech dudes company. Sounds like a plan to me. Your choice....  Righteho. I have work 9.30 - 1.30 today. Not sure if that is good or not. I like the fact I have been given a pay rise, that actually makes me work harder amazingly. Might run into Croydon after work to purchase some things.  Have a go at this one:  Why is it illegal to park in a handicapped parking space but its ok to use a handicapped toilet?

        HI EVERYONE  Right after approximately 1000000000000000 invites from nicki finally one has worked and i am back with you guys!  Looking through the last few posts i am fairly concerned with what i have to live up with, and hope my meaningless comments and sexual innuendos will be good enough for this sacred blogg.  My day today has been relatively boring and no where near exciting enough to mention here, overall this week for me has been absolutely brilliant and a much needed break, the amount of work i have got through and the pain and sweat i have put into all my subjects 18 hours a day has been totally and completely unbelievable. (and indeed you may choose not to believe that). Anyway i must now go and stare aimlessly at the motorola ICOM 2 way radios, because i am like that. Hope you are all having a great holiday and i will be back soon. Dave  (also known as, David, David Thomas, The new boy on the block, Sexy, sex bomb, as well as some others which will remain undisclosed)

       Some more things to educate you guys about. Goths. Did you know there are sterotypes of goths? No? Yes? I'll tell you about them anyway;   Romantic Goth   attitude: My capacity for love is certainly greater than this mortal coil can bear.  clothes: Anything with lace and frills: Edwardian, Victorian, renaissance.    Mopey Goth   attitude: Gentle people always perish in an unkind world.  clothes: romantic, modern.    Fetish Goth   attitude: Gentle people are excellent for spanking.  clothes: leather, PVC, fishnet, chains.    Perky Goth   attitude: Woohoo!  clothes: modern, fetish, cyber    Raver Goth   attitude: If it don't glow, it don't show.  clothes: phat pants, t-shirts, tank tops, flourescent thingies    Goth Geek   attitude: It's better than being a plain geek.  clothes: modern    Vampire Goth   attitude: Vampires are cool.  clothes: formal, jetset, romantic.    Pagan Goth   attitude: The occult and/or celtic religions are cool.  clothes:    Ren Faire Goth   attitude: The Renaissance Faire and role-playing games are cool.  clothes: medieval, renaissance, Scottish.    Other dark people  Deathrockers, rivetheads, metalheads, weekenders.  Just so you know.

       Yes Tom Yes, English Spag Bol. Hope your trip to Cornwall was fun. Sorry I didn't actually realise who you were on the train. Lol. It was pretty early.  So yesterday some of us went to Brighton which were (if you didn't know) Me, Paul, Jackie, Matt W, Dave Edwards, Char, Jenna, Jenny and Sarah.  Was lots of fun, except I got burnt. Damm the sun. I also managed to get us a bit lost but the less said about that the better... Day before that I did teh Hard Rock Cafe and theatre with Paul and omg it rocked so much and we are so doing that in the summer Paul. I'm gonna take you to see Jailhouse Rock or something. :p  Today I shall spend it working. Right now I can't do any as all my books are wet with paint and will take a few hours to dry. Wopee!!!

       In the process of looking up the anwser to this question I have discovered that the worker bee in the hive is worked to death! Outrageous! I vote we stage a revolution for them all. Mind you, what do you expect when the Queen bee kills her mother and any siblings. The 'drone' bee has it all, all HE does is mate with the Queen bee. Lucky him.  I have found out how bees have sex, read below:  The mating flight follows a pattern. The virgin queen flies to a congregation area where hundreds or thousands of unrelated drones await. The drones pursue the queen and several mate with her in flight. The drone mounts the queen, inserts his endophallus, and ejaculates his semen. During ejaculation, the male falls back and his endophallus is ripped out of his body and remains attached to the queen. Drones mounting later remove the previous drone's endophallus and lose their own through similar matings. The emasculated drones die very quickly with their abdomens burst in this fashion.   Um, interesting. And if you could see the diagrams I do then you shall see that the male bee looses his stinger. I wonder then if they do actually sting each other? So not that anyone wanted to know any of that but there you go! That is how bees have sex.

Here is something to ponder if you wish:  How do bees have sex?

       Today was interesting. Got up at 10 and went to see Gothika with Dave/Rich/Rob and a few other people. It's a good scary film, actually makes you jump unlike some of the others. Then we went for Pizza Hut, I only had one slice of pizza because I was too full up from the large popcorn and Coke from the cinema.  Plan for the week: Tues - Homework Wed - Fix Andy's PC Thurs - See Lora Fri - Homework Sat/Sun/Mon - At Nan's. Tues - School Wed - School Thurs - University Trip Thing Fri - School.

       To Jackie: I am alright thank you. I've just worked all day for the third time since Friday. Marvellous. Now my legs ache. How are you? How is everyone?  The Meaning of life.... who says there is one? Life doesn't have a set meaning. Life is a journey, not a destination. Guess it also depends if you believe in the afterlife. If you do, the meaning of life will probably be to lead a good life. If you don't, then the meaning of life is just to makea s much of your life as you can. But nah, there is no 'meaning to life'

       The joys of England which you do not realise until you have been away. English number plates. English crows. English pigeons. English sausages. English spag bol. English language. English people in general. English rain. English chips! English shower. English home. English road. English left side driving on the English road. etc.....  I've decided from my Barcelona trip that I dislike the French, and France. Quite a lot. So its not good really when I am going on next years art trip (most likely, ie: Phillips said: of course you can come, you can do what you like) (woo!!!!) to the South Of France. Gah.   What is everyone up to this weekend? I'm working 9.30 - 6.00 today and 10.00 - 2.00 tomorrow even though we are shut. Lol.   Have a good day.

       Perhaps your not making sense with being busy yet not a lot has happened. Perhaps your overreacting. Perhaps your not being told your wrong. Perhaps people disagree but perhaps because of that it makes a discussion / debate.  Wooo! I get paid 4.20 now! Wooo!

       I got back from Barcelona yesterday. I was like yay lets go read El Bloggo and catch up with what people have been doing this past week. Jackie tided her room. Thats it.  Thanks for blogging everyone. Your really keeping up the point of a group blog. I'm going to now invite some random people to join this so tough if you don't like them or whatever, its not as if anyone has given any suggestions. I'm going to invite:  Dave T (give him a re-try), Paul, Andy See how they work with this and then maybe some more depending how many people actually blog.  For now; I had a good time in Barcelona. Not that anyone has really asked. Except Paul. Then again I did see him yesterday. Or Matt. He asked. Thats about it really.

Thanks alot of depriving me of my exam time relief PAUL, grrrrr i was really looking foward to that extra week!!! Glad you finally found a bus anyway. I remain annoyed with pennie, but am genrally happier now so its all good. Hope you all had a good bank holiday, and i hope you all have a good week.  Talk to you all soon, Dave

       I see what you are saying Dave. I have noticed that they never come to the commmon room anymore to see everyone. Look back to year 11 and how big the groyup of friends. How when people organised the park just about everyone went. This year I have hardly seen Pennie. When I do she is with Stuart and they never part so I don't get any time to talk to her. I see Helen in textiles, when she turns up.  I would've gone down yesterday but I didn't finish work until 4.30ish and it was raining at the time. I also rang Pennie to check they were there and they had moved from the park into Helens shed. I had asked Pennie the day before to text me if they left the park so I knew where they were. That has annoyed me alot. She never remembers to tell me if they are somewhere else, or if she can't make it etc... I find it really rude.  But hopefully in the summer we can all down the park and if everyone mucks in in sending out the emails and stuff we'll all get there. Just I guess now we gotta work around when people are actually at work.  Talking of work. I'll be working today from 9 until 6 so if anyone feels like a walk come on up to woolies and buy yourselves some Cd's or sweets or toys or stationary or kitchenware. You know you want to. Actually you don't have to. Lol. In fact I want you all to stay home and have a lie in and have fun.  Have a nice day.

       Deep Dave, deep. We didn't go in the end, because they'd all wandered off by the time I finally made it there. I did start walking by the way, or running anyway, and a bus came and picked me up eventually :)  By the way Dave, I owe you an apology, I was wrong about the extra week, there isn't one. Looks like its time to start those drama notes now old chap!

       Hi, I did go to the park, and it did chuck it down with rain, and i didnt stay long, and today taught me something.  It dont matter how much money you have or what you can do in life, friends are f****** important to everyones happieness and those who dont have them are sad people. Pennie and Helen used to be popular people, but although they spent alot of money tried hard and pulled out all the stops to make today good, they simply dont have enough people who care about them to make it a sucess. If more people were there it would have been fun, they have thought about themselves too much this year and have ended up in an unfortunate situation (mainly pennie). Today has made me realise how important my friends are to me, especially my best friend and other close friends i have around me. I urge you all to think about your friends, and next time your having some 'huge argument' stop and think, why weaken or lose a friendship. No one can have too many friends, Just a thought. Talk to you all soon, hopefuly i will be able to come to the cinema on Wednesday. See you all soon, Dave

       I was going to go down the park, but I have decided against it, as it looks like its gonna chuck down with rain. Secondly I have a cold. Thirdly I would have to walk down by myself carrying a big teddybear. Fourthly the park gets boring after a few hours anyway.

       Max, could you not say 'Jesus Christ' in the sense that you do? You use it like as an insult and I think that is really disrespectful. Fine if you don't believe in it all but its being disrespectful to others.  If your going to the park don't forget to come into Woolies on your way down (if your walking) and come and buy your sweets and stuff. Yay!

       Well we can't go back to the old layout and I think this one works well. Yea the advertis annoying but it doesn't exactly spoil the whole site and I am happy with it.   General Studies was allright, I managed to anwser every question. Got 3 hours of geology today, not happy about that at all. I have been revising shockingly but none of it is sinking in so I most likely will fail this exam.  Great.  Good luck with CT everyone, good luck with any other exam you have this week.

       HI, I am not sure if i prefer the new or old layout, I had a good day off today, when of course i should have had a good day doing critical thinking revision. It looks like i will be made to re-take that next year, (whats the chances of me getting A-C)  Anyway, whish you all luck with all your exams, anyone like me needs all the luck they can get their hands on. Talking of what you can get your hands on, anyone see the  10:30 ITV news    Croydon high school , which is litrally a stone throw away from my house was on there, as well as  john ruskin college  and  other selsdon schools , because a load of kids in this area have stolen exam papers before the exams, piles of papers have been found on the streets of selsdon, and where was i during all this sudden media attention in the selsdon area, IN KENLEY !!!!!! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. Oh well one day i will be on TV, one day i will be a star! Talk to you all soon, Dave

       Well that sucked today. It wasnt too bad, but very boring. C grade?  Went round Dave's last night to sort some of his stuff out and help him with his next door neighbours computer. In the end we both earnt ourselves a score each!  The new Apple Mac rocks. I'm suprised you haven't got one Tom...  My feet are freezing. Ah! I'm getting double glazing in a few weeks!

       Morning everyone, Lots of changes to alert you to. First of all we have a new layout of: Tic Tac Blue as requested. Enjoy guys. Please keep your profiles updated. I can't figure out how to delete archives because I thought it'd be good to almost start again, ie: with the new template start new archives. However can't find this option so gonna have to have all the old posts as well which isn't too bad but remember (this goes to everyone) they are old posts from the past when things were different and before we grew up over the summer. Some people may get that more than others.  Um. Ok so that is the main change. LOL.  Sorry I couldn't make it to bowling, had to work all day and then do revison (forced to by parents, gah). I hope you had a good time.  General Studies today, should be a giggle NOT. 2 and half hours. Yipee. 3 hours geology tomorrow. Pants.  Hope you all have good day!

       Hiya Had a bad couple of days (reason i havent blogged), I am fine again now. Went dog racing last night, i won some and lost some, but end of the night, i came home with 12 less than i went with! It was a bit of a laugh. I really hope loads of people turn up on sunday, will be more exciting/challenging. But i am not a competitive person (lol hehe lol)  Glad to hear that everyone is revising as hard as i am, look foward to seeing as many of you as possible tommrow. Any problems or questions about tommrow, call/text me. Dave

       Work this weekend. Gah. Nice weather though. Yay! Dave I shall see what I can do but I doubt I'll be able to make seeing as I have no idea where it is. I'll talk to Lora, see how she is getting there. If I do come obviously I'll be late.  Have a nice weekend dudes, when on study leave those of us who usually go down park - maybe we should do that again? Sit under the tree, do sod all all day, be childish on slide. Lol. And whoever else wants to come should come!

       Yeah, everyone seems to be borrowing pirate equipment off of moi :b According to a few people, I look alright in a bandana, if I have it underneath my hair? I dunno, maybe I'll try it out a bit.  I'm listening to Run by Snow Patrol. Marvellous. I'm also very wet, cos I've just got back from doing my paper round, where the heavens decided to open. Am also a tad stressed about impending exams and whatnot, but should be OK... first one is Critical Thinking on Tuesday.  Gah, I'm gonna be at school virtually all half time rehearsing for the school play. Bah.

       I'll see what I can do Dave but I doubt I'll be able to get there before 3!! Still have to go home, get changed, eat and get there. I will probably get out of work late, usually do.  I'm on my second day of the art exam and its going horribly wrong. Explain more another time. Paul came over yesterday after school which was nice to see him :) He loverly. The quiz was amusing, we came second to last. Woo!! Some of the costumes were pretty cool. Adam Ant. What a giggle. And then all the nurses. Lol.   I am listening to the Bohemian Rhapsody. Love it. *big grin*.  I shall change the layout at the weekend most likely. Should be good.

       Hello Everyone, Nicki - If you finish at 2, you can still come a bit late if you want, loads of people are gonna be a bit late anyway. Max - Glad to hear you can come, i am trying to get Lora to come, but she has the same problems as Nicki Tom - If you can please let me know if you can come, cheers  Ok, Yesterday i went out for this meal, started with the theory that i had a physics exam in the morning (eg. this morning) so i wouldnt drink anything alcholic. It didnt last long,First of all i was joking around with the waitress and she guessed that i was 18/19 so i said yea i am, she then insisted on buying me a drink, and once you start you cant stop. I drunk far too much, i remember getting into the car with a beer and telling my dad that i hadnt been drinking at all. I wasnt the most drunk out of us 4 though so it could have been worse. I came in for the exam this morning, on time, but with sun glasses and a sore head!!! Still the exam went better than i expected, so that is good. I will not be in school tommrow. But i wilil be on friday. Please encourage others to come on sunday. I dont really care who comes, (you all know who i like and who i dont!) Look foward to seeing you all soon, Text me if you wanna know anything, Dave

       Happy Birthday Dave, I hope you have a great day!  Last night Paul and I went to see 'The Passion Of The Christ'. Very  very  powerful and moving film. I won't go on because I am sure you guys do not want to hear about my religious babble. Thank you for the invite Dave but on Sundays if I am not working all day I finish at 2. So can't come. Sorry.   General Studies exam: was ok. Missed a few of the sciency / mathy questions out but I anwsered the 40 mark one with tons of waffle. That usually works for me.  Template: I'll wait for votes from Max, Paul and Jackie before I decide weather we change or not. I think we may as we have had this layout since the blog begun.

       Pretty much every other single school in the country has sent their lower sixth off on study leave, apart from ours. Eliot's solution* to this is not to turn up to school unless he feels like. Quite right too.  Happy birthday David, it is officaly the 18th of May, so you are now 17. Hurah.  General studies exam? Well, err, I haven't a clue, I just wrote lots of crap.   * Max: You're probably looking at this and thinking that I've got an aprostophe there where I shouldn't have. Well I should, because the solution 'belongs to' Eliot, you use an apostrophe to indicate this.

       Dave, thanks for the invite. I think I can come sunday! :D  I was sick yesterday 5 times. Lovely. Was going to take the day off school BUT NO, I couldnt risk failing business studies and general studies for the sake of one day's work. Anyway I felt fine.  General studies exam was okay, I reckon a C/maybe low B. How did you guys/girls do?  Night.

       Hi, It seems like i am talking only to myself but i need to talk, i am in that kinda mood. I had my first driving lesson today, !!! YAY !!! I have the same driving instructur as Tom and Paul, the lovly Alison. I had 2 hrs or 2X 50 mins, i did loads, i can already do gears 1, 2 and 3, all the stearing business, i drove round cones, i stopped, did skid control, (as part of the stopping procedure) Also something exciting happened!!! the hook from a glider came falling to the ground towards our car! On Alisons say so, we quickly moved away from the landing site!!!! could have been a problem. anyway, it was great and i am happy, on monday we go drive in sandersted!!! at 11, so i advise you tell your parents to keep off the road between 11 and 12 on monday.  Apart from driving it is my birthday, or will be in 2 hrs and 20 mins, i got my pressies this evening, some cloths and driving stuff, main present being the driving lessons. I also got some money from distant relatives etc etc etc. Urm, tommrow i am going out for a meal with wayne, and both our girlfriends, so that will be nice.    SUNDAY BOWLING AMF 2 O'CLOCK  All of you lot are invited, and all your partners, (or potential partners, or whoever!) its kinda for my birthday but i am leaving it fairly open and everyone pays for themselves. Tell other people and stuff. Right i think i better go do some work and stuff. See you all soon, Hope you all well, Good luck with all the exams and stuff, Dave

       Tom and Dave, no need for jibes on here ok. I am sure you are both working hard weather you have an extension or not.  I worked a full day at woolies today. It was, in the words of Paul, 'filthily' hot in the store. I brought some chocolate after we shut and it was soft! I know last summer it was hot enough for the chocolate to have melted. It all had to be sent back because apparently you could hold up a bad of chocolate and see it in almost liquid form. Yucky. Oh yes I am looking forward to working over summer.  I managed to slice my hand 3 times with scissors today while ripping up boxes. Owee. They sting a lot.   Other news in my world; I have convinced mother to allow me to dye my hair, but only when I am 18 which is good. Better than the normal NO I get. LOL.   Those who don't run their own blog the urls for the templates are as follows, please tell me which you prefer if you have a preferance:  urlLink No.897   urlLink Snpashot Tequila   urlLink Tic Tac Blue

       Hi, I am having great fun, on my 'MEDIA WEEKEND' and just to annoy tom, i have now completed all of my research stage for video and radio! and by the end of the day i will have done a significant chunk of the pre-production stage too!!! So in a way i am happy, but its alot of work. Anyway, i got up really later yesterday and did media, then Becky (the gf) took me out for a candlelit meal for my birthday, she brought me Hugo Boss aftershave (the new and improved david now more irrasistable than ever before) so that is nice. and she brought me a big glittery card, also her parents brought me a card (From them) (is that strange???) so i got home at 00:30 this morning and slept for a while, up nice and early to do this media, am now having a short break, and a BBQ in a bit. Then back to work. I hope your all well, and we will do something soon, i am thinking i wanna take people bowling next weekend, maybe sunday. what do we think? good idea? Anyway work to be done, speak to you all soon, Good luck tom, Dave

Anyone know details for it? When? Where? I missed my last lesson due to textiles exam so meh.  Um, I'm all injured. My neck is killing me when I look down so being on the till today won't help at all. Its partly the way I sleep, I sleep in a funny position and also partly due to stress. I have noticed how when I am very very stressed some limb or something hurts. The other week I couldn't breath properly because my ribs were hurting. Now its my neck. Ack.

Friday was a good day for me as I only had one proper lesson, My revision is not going well as I find it physically impossible to revise but meh...  General studies should be fun... Scientific domain... Argh, its gonna suck so badly, we have been doing practice papers and they are impossible! Because its the scientific domain I get to miss the next general studies lesson we have cause I'm doing scientific domain at the moment...  Yes, I have no work to day, good job too because shortly I will be venturing outside to top up my tan... If the sun is still out that is!  I will be tidying my room today as it looks like a mass of papers and clothes... Shouldn't take me that long. I'm also going to the library.  Thats about it from me. I might update a bit later if someone else blogs.

I know I am doing Science paper.Er...Monday evening I'm going to see The Passion Of The Christ as hinted at by Starky as I am doing that in Art. I think Paul is coming but he is still deciding. Um. Yea and that is as far as I am thinking ahead.   Have a good weekend ya'll. :p

       Today I proved to Beckett that his car has fluffy steering.  Proper steering is what they have in real cars like Jaguars and Aston Martins. Beckett seems convinced that fluffy steering was part of a man's car, and all these nice cars have rubbish steering. (Before any of you have a go at me, I am aware that Beckett can't get a Jaguar, the point I'm making is that he thinks his steering is the best and that proper steering is boring.)  Proper steering is the one where you can feel the road as you go round tight corners. Fluffly steering is when you require very little effort to turn the wheel; fluffly steering is also when you can turn the wheel from full left-lock to full right-lock without moving the car.  I successfully proved him wrong by driving around the car park using my pinky finger only on the steering wheel, then turn the wheel right round without moving the car (doesn't did the tires any good, but I was proving a point dammnit!).  He later proved himself wrong by driving around that tight corner on the Caterham by-pass, only with his pinky finger on the steering wheel.  Thomas 1, Beckett 0.

I have my textiles exam in two days. Ahhhh.  I have to go and find Mr Hogg today and have a stern word with him. Which will probably end up in him having a stern word with my form tutor but I am very upset about what he said to me yesterday so grrr.

       Lee's allright. Don't be mean. We have mucked up lives.  I enjoyed myself. All the rain did was make me cold but hey, I got Paul to keep me warm. Jackie had my jumper. Lol. I really enjoyed myself, another fab party from Andy - nice one! Found it hard to pull myself out of bed. No hangover for me, I didn't drink that much. Can't help but laugh at Matt W, I bet when he got up today he felt awful. Tsk tsk. Well I enjoyed myself and can't wait to party with Paul and Neil etc... again.

       HI, Welcome to Saturday. Just got home from Andys. It was great fun, had a really good time, and have some good photos. Ever the rain couldn't spoil the mood and atmosphere, well done to Andy for yet another, highly successful and well organized party. Although there is already things about the party I am regretting, doing/saying. Generally it was brilliant and nice to let my hair down 'as they say'. One word if anyone don't know what to talk about LEE. You could write a book on every day of his weird and mucked up life. It scares me. Talk to you all soon, Have a great weekend. Dave

       Errrr probably jeans and tshirt and light jacket. Everyone always gets really hot when on the castle and stuff.   So I only just got in from school. Spent past 2 hours drawing a man, naked. He was naked not me. It was quite good, he was talking to us before and he did the poses we needed. He did the pose of the crucifiction of Christ. It was really good. I did some good pictures. Nakedness. Gah. Unless its Paul :p  Err what else. Oh yea I can't breath properly, My whole rib cage hurts, mainly on the left side. I'm kind of worried. It REALLY hurts to breath. And no one else is in so I can't ask mother what to do. Gah. Maybe I'll just die. Or not. Rather not.

       Lol Jackie, so 100% of your grass is going to be taken up by a trampoline? :P  I am wearing Jeans and a blue/dark shirt (NO, not the hawiaan one).  Ohhh yeah, ordered my eMac today. Should arrive before the 14th.

       Well... Not much to blog about, hense why I haven't blogged.  If I have not already said, I might be getting a trampoline, I just have to convince my dad it's a good idea and that it won't ruin his grass... I measured the garden and it is just big enough for a 12ft trampoline. So that's the one I will be getting if I can convince my dad.  I am looking forward to Andy's party, it should be fun. I have a question though:   What is everyone wearing?   I stayed after school today and did some work, I also played a game of pool with Laura. We started playing thinking there was no white ball so we were using the black ball, only for an upper 6th person to say, why arn't you using the white ball? We were like Dohhhh  Umm, yea thats about it.

       OK so I was only in school for first 2 lessons today then I went to London with Scott and James (Maragone) to do arty stuff like visit the Tate and St Pauls. Well well well. 1) James decided to cross the road at a non crossing point and we were nearly run down by a motorcyslist 2) while walking over the milliemememen bridge there was this HUGE fork of lightening the next bridge over so we stood to watch then realised we were on a metal bridge so promtly left 3) standing outside St Pauls and it starts to hail reeeeeeeeeeally heavily so all 3 of us squished into a phone box and then there was this huge FLASH and lightening struck St Pauls right next to us 4) on way through croydon James decided to run across the tram track and nearly got us run over  Thats 4 times I nearly died today. *cries*

       Good morning ya'll. Hope your plans for the day are full of sleep and rest or in Pauls case working but getting lots of dosh!!!! :p I am offt o bluewater today, kinda annoyed I had to get up early. Ate out last night and will be eating out today so I'm gonna be fat on Monday. I am pondering buying some kind of excerise thingy. I like rowing machines but too expensive for me. Um what else. Oh yea blue fans are really bitchy. I made a post on the official blue forum to say I was selling some blue singles etc.. an dthey are all replying going 'omg how can you sell them i'd treasure them forever'. I'm like helloooooooooooo I am trying to help some of you out here! Idiots.    If you could spend a month doing whatever you want, going whereever you want where would you go and why and what would you do?

       Sorry to hear you not so happy Dave :( oh :(  how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most?  because you put all your faith and trust in that one person so if they do something weather its intentional or not it will hurt ten times more than from any otyher. It's life, it sucks but it happens. You just got to be careful about who your closer friends are.  and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers?  no idea!  and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live? You don't say anything. Sometimes they live a lot longer than that one month. You spend teh next month giving them good memories, taking them places or just being all that you can be for them. You just gotta try and make them happy so they don't regret their last month or so. Hope its all ok :) Btw Dave when is your bday?  Sorry this is short would write more about my amazing day at Woolies but must dash off to Gatwick. See you all soon!

       Hello everyone, my long weekend isnt quite going to plan and isnt anywhere near as enjoyable as i had hoped it would be. Just one question for you all today, how is it fair that your best friends are the people who can hurt you the most? and why is it that their mums always need you to go and fix their computers? and finally what do you say to someone who has been given a month to live?  They are three questions i asked myself yesterday, hope your all having fun, see you soon. Dave

        W00T!  I finally have all my money for the eMac. Will cash the last of it in Tuesday, and wait til the 12th/13th May for it to be delivered.  Had my group interview at Waitrose today, went quite well........Matt.B is lucky - they get like 10% of their wages every year bonus - as well as 50% off ANY external class you take - for example, if I was to take guitar lessons, Waitrose will pay 50% of it! W00T!  Byebye.

       HIYA, I like your description paul, most informative, and imaginative. I have been at school this evening doing stuff for stagecoach, i dont mind too much becuase i get paid for all that. Anyway i am suffering from sleep deprevation, actually it feels like in the night when my body is trying to go to sleep, a team/army of small ompa-lompa type beings is creeping into my room, picking me up and taking me to several amusment establishments, where i am forced onto a vast amount of high intensity rides, after which i do one lap of the world (running) after which i am thrown out of an airoplane traveling at extream veloicity (without a parachiot) i would then land in the sea and have to swim the length of the atlantic, followed by many a hungry shark back to my bedroom, where the seemingly nice small people would tuck me in and leave me there to awake in the morning feeling like the night never happened. So thats that out the way. See you all soon, Dave

       I shall tell you all what my throat feels like. It feels like someone has ripped it out, and thrown it into the woods, whereupon a tiger has found it. It has taken it home, and fed it to it's 3 little tiger cubs, who have mauled it for a period of 18 days. Then, a hunter comes and shoots the tigers, and manages to accidentally shoot my throat four times in the process, picked it up, ran it through the blender 7 times, dipped it in acid, rubbed it down with sandpaper, and then returned it to me. Gah.

       The Tempest is over now which is quite sad. I kinda wish it was still going on, although it is nice to have my life back a bit. Well done again to everyone :)  What is everyone doing for work shadowing / experience? I'm not doing it. I am using my costumey stuff from the shcool play and shall go into school on Thursday to do textiles all day as I have alot to catch up on. Eek.   I'm stupidly tired.

Worked all day today, feet hurt like hell, but I learnt how to put newspapers away, tying them up, counting, sticking ect...  Hopefully get a payt rise in a few weeks/months.

       I also was extreamly pleased with how last nights show went, and all potential 'situations' were defused so thats all good. Looking foward to doing it all again tonight, however it always gets a bit sad knowing that months of work and time and effort has gone into this show and now its finishing. Oh well, i am still happy, see you all soon.  Dave

I am so proud of everyone involved including the techies and very proud of Paul.  Well done to everyone and I look forward to being back tonight. I am sure tonight will be just as good if not better.  For now I must go off to work, wopee.

       First show was indeed good, hoping the next two will be even better though  Was a tad disappointed by the football result, but ah well, we'll get another chance in two years, so never mind, eh?  I'm not entirely sure how friendly the atmosphere will be backstage tonight. Certain members of the tech crew, and a certain actress may very well be a bit difficult to work with. Ah well, here's hoping it goes OK *fingers crossed*

       HIYA First show tonight and it went really really well, couldnt have been better. So it is not in my mind surprising that the evening ended with a punch up. Nothing is ever 100% perfect.

No idea why Tom hasn't blogged so could you blog please Tom? Thanks :)  I've been helping out with the production for the Tempest, I've been doing costumes and set and stuff so wheeeeeeeeeeeee! Yay :) The show is looking great, really good acting with some great sounds and lighting in it so come and see! tickets on sale from the box office at break times. Students are 4.00. It rocks.

       Thought I'd pop in and say Hi.  Haven't really been up to much lately although I had a successful shopping trip yesterday. I counted up my DVD's and I have 29... All brought from WHSmith and since November! I shall be buying the Scary movie box set when I get payed as I can't afford it until then. I'm working tonight and so am bunking off last lesson, I'm then working all day saturday...  Means lots of money when I get paid! Yay!  Nicki about the cinema, when do you want to go? Just chat to me on msn or something...  I won't be on the internet much tonight as I'm working till about 8, won't get home until at least 9pm... Then I have a exam tomorrow, so will have to revise. Of course I probably won't revise...  Parents have got tickets to Wimbledon, so they have gone off there today. But I think it will rain so they probably won't see much play, which is a shame really as the ticket are quiet expensive. I heard they are seeing Venus Willaims and some other well known dude. I just can't think of the name right now. there is also some other random person that knocked Hennman out of the French open so they are seeing some good amtches considering its the opening day. they are on number one court I belive so that's also good!  Well. that's my blog for a while. Blog agin in a few days/ weeks!

CounterStrike at night, obviously.  Next week will be interesting. Parents are away from tuesday til Friday night! W00T! Having the whole house to myself.  Pah, I have to go in on inset day to do an exam. Sucky.

       I've got my daddy a dvd: D-Day In Colour. He likes the in colour ones. Yay. I'm absolutly knackered. Past 2 days I have been mostly in textiles room helping to do the tye dying for the school play next week. Its pretty tiring but they need it done. next Wednesday I am doing the textiles stall for the induction days along with Megan and someone else, maybe Helen? Should be interesting and hey we get to dress up smartly!  Work today until 1.30 then going up to school to get T-shirts to bring home and finish off. Going to see Charlenes play tonight with Paul :). Working all day tomorrow.   What is everyone upto this weekend?

       Pah, the BB row was just like the usual Saturday here when my Dad comes home from work. Nothing TOO special, except the table going over and the tin foil tray.  Anyhow, 2 x 1.58 has been charged to my bank account without me saying so......contacting the bank on Tuesday to sort it out.  As for A-Levels, I am sticking to what I did last year. I will probably take General Studies A2. Might as well, 3 lessons a fortnight and a whole A2 for it. General Studies does suck though...but I think I can tolerate it for another year.  Fathers Day Sunday.........what have we all got em'? I haven't purchased anything yet, but i'll give him a massive bar of Cadburys choc and a new shirt (as his old one is all worn round the collar).

       I don't tend to watch BB that much, just on a random basis. I watched it last night and thought what a bunch of losers. All the fighting and stuff its just like oi, you fools, grow up. Although I supose makes it interesting to watch although I kinda got bored of it after a while. But yea. No riots in Croydon last night, good. Just lots of people. So its good when England win because the hoodlums stay away. Woo!  First day back at school everyone? How'd it go?  I thought it was ok. I was very very tired though. What is everyone doing for September, dropping any subjects or taking up any?

       Hiya everyone, On the footbal front its really not my thing. People shouldnt riot, but those who do know what they are getting themselves into, i think they should all be locked up. Maybe we need to build a prision in Croydon, maybe in the new Central centre. Drama exam was ok, had to stay at school keep an eye on the lights, got home about nine, some of the art was to a really good standard this year, well done everyone, however i must now urge all art and textiles students to remove their work, as soon as possible, or it will be removed for them, we have a show to do!!!  Talk to you all soon, see most of you tommrow, Dave

       I don't see how they can be good at what they do. Its just kicking a ball round and keeping fit. Doesn't really require much skill. I admit if you put me there I'd suck but then again I suppose if you practise to the extent and all that they do then yea you would be better than others but I really cannot see the skill or talent involved. I know its a part of the police's job to deal with rioting but I don't see why people need to turn around and have a go at the police when all they are doing is trying to stop the rioters damaging too much property and from injuring other people.  I tend to get really pissed off when people slag off the police which if what hooligans and such do because they are doing their job. Its not like they go out of their way to spoil their fun or whatever, its their job as you say and I wish that people would think twice before doing something which can injure or kill a police officier, what about their families and such? Shame people don't think much these days.

       It's fair enough to have an opinion but a few of the things u mentioned I disagree with. It doesnt suck, it is a bunch of overpayed kids i agree, but they are bloody good at what they do.  The riots and alcohol stuff is a bit o.t.t because those thugs will get pissed and fight about anything, when theres no world cup, they'll fight over a bloody ham sandwich!  The policemen bit.  Its their job, though it sounds harsh, but it is their job.  My mum and dad enjoyed their time in the police but it wasnt the easiest job they ever had.  My dad was quite often wrestling 7 foot south african burgalars, and he didnt always come out on top!  BTW, Im not having a go... :)  Its nice every two years to have a tournament of the countries favourite game.  Apart from that, Im working loads stil, not enjoying all of it, but hey, its money. Will see you all tomorrow :)  Still, best of luck to England, and speak soon to y'all

       Well football in my opnion sucks. I really don't like the game itself and I have made the effort and watched a match before but I find it incredibly pointless because in my opinion its some guys kicking a ball into a net which doesn't actually require that much talent. I like footie when your playing it with your mates and its just a laugh but anything bigger, no thanks. Give me a good ol game of rugby, a bunch of lads with a ball. Simelar to footie in that aspect but there are many more ways of scoring etc... And that really is talent, just look at Johnny Johnny Johnny Wilkinsons lastkick. Yuss! Although lately I have become a bit partial to cricket. I love it. Woo! The barmy army, love em!! So back to why I hate football. I hate the world cups and stuff because you get all the football hooligans which I know isn't everyone but it seems to be most people and then they have to go off and get pissed and get into fights (something riugby goers do not do, a game I went to the fans simply shook hands said good game then wandered off happy as bees) just take Croydon as an example. 400 fans in Croydon, riot. Smash windows etc..., surrounded a tram. 15 or so policeman were injured. Thanks a lot, what if that had been my dad working that night? Luckily he wasn't but he could be next time. I see why people drink alcohol at games but there is no need to drink that amount that causes rioting. I mean, what exactly were they rioting about?? The fact we lost? well we still have 2 games left and even if we lose oh well, theres always next time.

       The football was quite disappointing, although I was so knackered that day I spent most of it asleep. I like football when it's the World Cup and stuff, cos of the massive levels of patriotism, which is cool.... I've been trying to work out what it is about football that makes it our country's most popular sports..... anyone help me on that one?  Anyway, on a more academic note, last exam today, Drama, then a rehearsal for the Tempest, and then FREEDOM!!! .... until tomorrow that is

       35 hours of over time so far in One Week!! How are we all?  Sorry Ive not been around to chat much, been living at sainsbury's!  Im gonna get a hoomungus pay check! Can't wait!  I wasn't happy about Englands football game.  I know no one is a big footie fan, but if you saw the game you will understand!  We were beating France, the competition favourites, and they scored two goals in less than a minute to win it!  bastards :(  Still, Im thinking of organising a get together somewhere, somehow.  So after nine gruelling hours of sainbury's, 3 on trolleys in this blooming heat I'm rather sweaty so I am now off to take a bath!!! see you all soon :)  Andy

What I would give for spending all that time collecting trollys rather than having abuse shouted at me via the idiotic hoodlums that hang around outside Woolies. Gah. Anyways, Nicki Johnson (Jen's sis) sent me a pic from her leavers ball trhough. Awww, I wish i could do our leavers ball all over again. Lol. It was so much fun. I love limos. When I'm older I shall buy one. And a driver to drive me around all day. Woo! Limo are cool. It was really good that night. I'm sure our sixth form one will be good as well, if not better? But then again, in year 11 you have your friends around you who you have known for years whereas now people like Angela etc.. have gone off somewhere else. Oh :(

       Hey all, sainsbury's sucks!  why can't they get trolleys that put themselves away when the customer finishes with it, rather than have some poor sod like me take 5 full hours to put them all away, finishing at half bloody ten!!  Still, I took a half hour brake so ner ner nikiniki ner ner sainsbury's!!  I did 6 and a half hours tills yesterday, well 3, i spent the rest of the time putting things on the shelves that the customers decided they didnt want when they got to the checkout!  I also had to buddy someone, means I'm good at my job!!!  They wanted me to watch over someone who was new and hepl them out if they got stuck, coolio or what!  Doing gardening today, sorting out Annie's Kennel.  She's gonna have a big bush going around it, talking of big bushes, has anyone seen The Mighty Boosh on BBC 3?  its VERY funny, and I recommend it,  its on most nights at 8 or half past.  Other than that all is well, looking forward to having a big reunion on thursday!  I wonder what the dress code will be this time!  beach wear, ski wear, posh, we'll see.  I know theres not many exams left but for those who do have some, again I wish you all the best of luck, and for those of you get back from the physics exam this eveing, I hope it went well!!  Brazil Night is a bit of a cock up, theres loadsa of jobs that need doing and I'm not sure we have enough people coming.  Hopefully it'll work out when the meetings start up again. If anyone has anything which could be given as a raffle prize that they don't want, or that can be brought for a small price, let me or Tom know!  Chow for Now, love and all the rest of it...

       Jackie is taking a break I spoke to her on msn about it. David there isn't a general feeling for you to leave. Lets now just forget about that and move on ok?  So today working 10 til 4.30. The word gah springs to mind but as it is such a nice day hopefully most folk will be at home sun bathing or something and won't have the energy to enter a store like ours which has no air conditioning so we all boil every day. Last summer it was so hot the chocolate melted. As in you could pick up a packet and it would literally be liquid form. I brought Rolocoaster Tycoon 2 yesterday. If anyone has it do you know how to delete a scenario you create? Lol. Any other news for you all? Um. Not at the moment. Oh yea schol play is in a couple weeks so come see! I am going on the Thursday with Matt W so if any of you wanna come please do. (Paul, Charlene, Becky, Helen, Pennie etc.. are in it)  Other than that have a nice day.

Everyone else, calm down, if it is the general feeling that you all WANT me to leave, i will, just let me know. Hope you are all well, (i suppose i should have just lied, and said that everything was fine, but i dont like lieing) Dave

       Okay........just read the last 10 blogs or so.......right.  Anyhow - Andy - V.Cool news! Where are you practising your drumming? Gonna get a drum kit soon? I think I will get my guitar in a few weeks.....yeah!  The rest of my holid......sorry, "study leave" will be spent playing CounterStrike, as I have nothing to do. My final exam is Thursday in about 10 days time. Business finance - whoop-de-doo.  ICT was okay - Paper 1 being easier than Paper 2. Some questions were a bitch. Combined with the coursework, I reckon I got a C, maybe a B. Just have to wait til August!  Ciao.

       From readin this blog I have come to the conclusion that I do not wish to be part of it anymore. David. You are the most annoying person to blog on here I have ever met. You made an arguement out of nothing. Nicki, I stand by you as all you were trying to do was sort things out. DAvid. Lay of the sarcasm and stop being a fucking arsehole basically.  Hey and goodbye Andy :)  Oh and this isn't the only reason I'm leaving. I never have anything to post about and generally I forget I'm even part of this blog. You can leave me on if you wish and I will poist once in a blue moon. But for the time being I don't want to be part of it.

       hey davie.  Thank you for the kind words :) Had a hair cut, as i said earlier. SHORT! No windsurfing though, the wind would have been good! I did however buy Joss Stone's new album.  very cool.  I got The New Breed as well, proper bo. Searching for drumming lessons, found one in warlingham and one in croydon, prices are VERY high, so I'm basically being as tight as a fat mans pocket and going for the cheapest one! I stink so im gonna go shower! chat soon ya?

       Wel Dave heres why I say that. I started up this blog and I invited people to join and blog with me which they all have. Good. Now, this means that as I run it (not that there is alot to do) I just try and keep people blogging. Thats basically all I do. I could've quite easily deleted yours and Toms posts and left it blank or I could've edited them but I didn't. Instead I left you both a message trying to stop an argument escalating which is what it seemed like and instead you turn around and start yelling at me. I do not appreciate that especially after I invited you back a second time to rejoin El Bloggo. Now if you want to discuss this any further email, msn or phone me. I am sure no one else wants to read which is most likely plastered as a petty argument. Enough.  Hi Andy, glad you could join. If anyone wants to Andy Mr Woodcock here was the cause of a HUGE queue in Woolies today. He didn't have enough money so ran out to get some (this is the second time this has happened) and caused a great big queue. Tutt tutt. Lol. Silly boy. But you do keep us amused. Yea work wasn't that great as I wasn't in the best of moods. I ended up realphabetising the drawers as some people can't spell properly and keep putting the cd's in the wrong places. Gah. No big dramas. All day tomorrow. Off to Croydon now to buy a PC game and to say hi to Paul. Have a nice day ya'll.

       Hiya, Nicki - I am sorry for being responsable for your happy mood going drastically downhill. That was not what i had aimed to do, but one thing, stop being so padantic and masterful over 'YOUR BLOG' WHICH YOU OWN PERSONALLY. No one likes that. Just calml down a bit and everything will be ok. Its nice to hear from you Andy, and nice to see you chose to blog, and didnt get a detention or solatry confinment from the 'master of the blog' the 'supreme leader of us all'. I hope everyone who went had a good time at 'Harry Potter' and i once again apolagise for not being able to make it. I hope you are all well and enjoying the rather 'heated' discussions, of late.  Talk to you all soon, Dave

       Hey all, it is I, Andyrew. How are you all?  Long time no see for a lot of you! Tom, Max, how was the ICT exam? How is everyone else doing with exams?  I'm done with them now, woohoo! I'm thinking of having my head attacked by a lawnmower, when you next see me it'll be short!  lovely.  Hopefully windsurfing today, should be fun.  I had no work last night!  apparently i booked holiday, cooool. Anywho, catch you all soon, and have fun blogging back! Love and stuff like that Andy

       Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry sorry David you thought that was me attacking you? If you must know I was not. That was actually me pointing out that you don't need to remind people to blog, thats what I do. Yes people have exams but I'm still trying to get people to blog at least once a week so really Dave, there is no need for you too. And I am deeply deeply troubled and sorry that I asked to chill out I mean how could I possibly have taken those posts the wrong way? I mean the fact that what you both wrote seemed to me, a innocent bystander, very sarcastic and a bit bitchy was completely my fault and I shall never never do it again. Oh dear, the consequences of my words of trying to calm you down when you did seem rather annoyed. Bad Nicki for trying to sort out nedativeness on the blog. Bad Nicki. How dare you! If you like I can demonstrate me attacking you, here we go:   First of all , you can not attack  me  for asking people to calm down when there is clearlya small upset weather or not you were joking. How the fuck am I supoosed to know that? I quote: It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said. -  6/10/2004 10:51:28 PM. That sounds like you are being bitchy and I care what the fuck you think about that because everyone is bitchy sometimes yes like me being bitchy and fucking pissed off right now. Ooo great start to the day huh? Thanks.   Secondly , I was only telling you to fucking relax because you got all annoyed and at this time most people need to relax anyway but bad Nicki for trying to her mates to calm down and feel better. I'll never do it again.   Thirdly , You and Tom don't clash? Fine. Fair enough. I'm not actually bothered but in that case if you are joking around together make it more clear or just don't jokily insult each other that way dumbass people like me won't get confused and try to help sort it out. Gosh I still can't believe, I was simply trying to help you out. Never again.   Fourthly , shut the fuck up about my spelling no one spells perfectly all the bloody time and usually if your writing things in a rush not everything is spelt right. Ooo how dare I say that, I bet your spelling is perfect allllll the time. And anyway don't start on all that jazz until you can blog perfectly, ie: using an I instead of i.   And Finally , I am bitchy and probably always will be.  Now I didn't have a problem with you and I don't want you to leave. I was simply trying to sort your little what appeared to me to be a tiff out so that it did not escalate into pages like this and getting people all wound up for nothing. For maybe next time instead of you being so public about attacking me you should talk to me.  Have a nice day.  Back to normal blogging.  I had begun my day quite happily. Felt fufiled by my breakfast and then I came on here to check email and whatnot to find I was being attacked as people like to put it and so now my happy mood has drastically gone downhill. Great. Have a nice day everyone.  And yes I know I could've simply either said sorry or just not replied at all but hey I'm childish and was under the impression that it was my blog to start off with and that you knwo kinda said I could try and stop people from arguing. Oh how disillusioned I am.

       Hiya, I read what you wrote nicki, I have a response:  First of all , you can not attack me for asking people to blog, and can not say that you think they should be concentrating on exams, because in the last few weeks you have written the following, 'Could everyone other than Jackie and Dave blog please? Thanks.' - 6/3/2004 04:17:22 PM 'Max could you blog please.' - 6/5/2004 08:16:51 PM  Secondly,  I do NOT need to relax, i am perfectly relaxed, and most of all, I dont need you telling me to relax.  Thirdly,  Me and Tom do NOT clash, we are actually good friends, and just sometimes joke around having a go at each others posts, i have spoken to him and neither of us are actually offended by anything each other say. Fourthly, if you are going to attack me so publicly, use real words 'onvious'???  And Finally , I am not bitchy, nor will i ever be.  And to think the main reason i came on here this evening was to write nice things and compliment you on your art/textiles display.   If you have any further problem with me, i will not hesitate in leaving. I am sorry it has come to this nicki, maybe next time you could speak to me or something controversial like that.     Well despite that little annoyance i am actually very happy today, have had a good day, i hope everyone else is good too. See you all soon. Dave

       I set this website up as an online diary or a blog as I use the word along with so many other people around the word who also use the word blog as an online diary. This blog is an online diary not for articles etc.. unless you feel them important enough to mention when writing about you day and things. Tom no one is attacking you, everyone is just stressed and whatnot at the moment so I think we all need to relax a bit. David you need to relax. If people need to blog I'll write they need to as I usually do. But at the moment if people don't blog its fine, exams, good reason. So calm down, just blog when you want so long as you blog regulary. And please, little bitchiness. Its onvious you two clash a bit. Just calm...

       This isn't a blog, it's a diary.  Blog is an abbreviation of weblog, which is a log of what you find interesting on the web. Typicaly, you find a website or article about an issue on the web and talk about it. A group weblog is the same, only with more people.  This isn't a blog, it's a diary; seeing as everybody seems to have a problem with me at the moment I might as well not bother with it at all.

       Hi, Mr Thomas Edwards - It seems to me that the only time in which you blog, is to contradict, or genrally attack what someone else has said, normally me or nicki, maybe you are scared of the others. Anyway, as far as i am aware the general idea is that you talk about what you have been up to, and what is going on in your life. So try doing that for a bit, see what happens.  As for everyone else, hi again.  Dave

       Hi everyone, Everyone seems a bit stressed, and i know full well i am no where near stressed enough, when we were revising and doing stuff for our GCSEs i managed to be stressed very well, but this time even though they are important exams, i am not stressed, or worried, and that is bad and becuase of it i will fail at least half my As level exams, and i am not happy about that. Anyway good luck, especially to paul, stay calm paul. See you all soon, i miss you all,  byebyebyebye Dave

       Hiya, I am happier than i have been for weeks and weeks, Last night i took out Wayne for his surprise, we went in a limo with both of our gfs to london to see, 'The Lion King' Finished me off financially, but was the best night i have had for so long, months. And was worth it for the look on his face and the hugg i got. So i am happy, check my msn window for a pic of us in the limo. Eventually me and nicki will have a site back up ready and online so the whole picture sharing thing will be easy again. I hope you're all as happy as i am, or happy. Say 'HI' to Vee for me Jackie, Nicki, a plan for your woolworths theives, 'take a shot gun to work!' Speak to you all soon, Dave

       That blog was rather exciting to read. Maybe I should start blogging like that?  Anyway. My sister has arrived home from uni. Mountains of clothes to wash and we have no idea where half of her stuff is going to go. I think the loft is a good option.  I shall we wanting to see Harry Potter some time next week. Anyone interested in coming please contact me on msn as I have to discuss the details such as time and what day we shall go.

       Max could you blog please. No idea what you are going on about Tom and Dave.  I worked 9.00 til 5.30 today. Not much to do as we received the wrong delivery. Oh well. So I spent most of the day on a til of some sort and encountered some very very rude people. I got to throw 3 kids out of the store who then spent most of the morning shouting abuse at me.  I can't believe that though. I don't mind working at Woolies but we get abused by hooligans outside and then nick stuff and the other day they threw flour all over our stocking area out the back. Idiots. They are pathetic but cause so many problems for us.  Something is being done. We had petition going for cameras outside all the shops. I believe there is a meeting next week at like 8 in the morning for shop runners to talk about geting better security and stuff.  Its outrageous though it really is.

       For the last three days, I've been at school rehearsing for the school play, The Tempest. I have four exams after half term, and I'm not confident on my revision for any of them. I have lines to learn for The Tempest. It's right after the exams. Right after that we have work shadowing. Bye now

       Hiya, Tom - I am neither confused or dying to know more. Something you may be interested in, i bumped into mr hogg today, he has put on order for next yr, 2 more cameras and 2 more e-macs. so thats good. I did, if you havent guessed already, pop into school today, to oversee a drama rehursal,  that was good, the tempest may actually be a good show! Other than that i have had all the social dilemas and problems you normally have in a month in one day, so thats not a good thing, and now everyone has gone to sleep before i could put things right, and i hate it when that happens. Lots of chatting to do in the morning i guess.  Hope you all well and revising hard. Dave

       So yesterday was at work from 9 until 6. Not too bad really. Found out what the great British public like to buy on a sunny bank holiday: swingball. Woo! And black bistro sets. At 29.99. Woo!  Today I wandered into Croydon and back out again having brought like nothing apart from some more hair shampoo. LOL. Great. I am such a big spender. Haha. Paul is coming over once he finishes work so that'll be cool. Other than that I haven't done very much. I should've spent today doing revsion. But did I? No. Gah.

       Fair enough Dave. Hope ya have fun in Canada! Nice place.  Hey Max I presume you've spent most of your days playing this Counterstrike game then huh? Heehee, I've spent most of my time when I haven't been out playing Rolocoaster Tycoon 2. I'm addicted :(   Coudln't sleep last night. Thought I'd get to bed earlyish but it was so hot and then once I finally got to sleep I woke up again then went back to sleep so all in all I slept about 3 hours last night before waking up at 8.15 by the sun streaming in through my white curtains. Gah. So I'm tired.

       My week has been okay I suppose. I'm meant to see Lora sometime, but I don't know when that is.   So far I have been doing nothing over the holidays since Sunday, when I came back from my Aunts. One thing to look forward to: Bad Lads Army tonight! Best thing ITV have had on all year.   On another positive note, I managed to grab a high score of 27 kills to 11 deaths on CounterStrike, coming in first place - and far ahead of the second to top who had a score of 19 kills to 15 deaths. I'm sure you are all very, very interested in that.   Now i'm off to have lunch and to chase up Apple. They need to replace my eMac monitor due to two mini electron guns going tits up.

       Well my weekend was crazy what with work work work! *cue disney song: whistle while you work, la la la la la la laaaaa* Yea anyways....lol. Had my half day of till training yesterday. Got into an argument with my manager a bit about being allowed to do refunds. I don't want to do them, he wants everyone to do them. Had a lecture on shrinkage. Great. Um yea the new tills are fun, they are touch screen and we will go live in August at some point so if you come into woolies watch out because queues may be long what with getting to know the tills an all.  After work I popped over to Jackies to give her pressie, yay! Then went to Paul's which was fun. We played Spiderman monoolopy! Yay! It was cool. :) Today may be off to Ikea to get bedroom furni.  Dave why you break up with Becky? You two seemed cool.

       Well worked this morning so didn't open my cards and one present until about 2.30pm!  Work was boring and I was really tired, possibly because I didn't get to sleep until about 2am last night as I was so bloody hot! I went to bed at about 12.30am so I was pretty pissed off.  I got a cool card from work, they give us weird cards and I was given one about marriage, it was quite funny especially some of the notes inside... I'm now getting married tomorrow to my good buddy susanna!  I got given a School of Rock DVD from my parents, along with some money for my holiday and the money its gonna cost to get a provisional liceanse. My sister got me some stuff about driving, so that was fun! Oh yea and I got given some L plates... The rest of my "presents" was in fact money and I think it added up to about 250 all together, so not bad really! Althought its already gone down cause I owed my mum 20 and my dad 10!  Cinema last night was good, meal was nice although I was kinda annoyed because there were some people there that I don't particulary like that much. Darren pissed me off because he did nothing but smoke all night. He had like 15 cigarrettes while we were out... About 7 after the film finished and before we got on the bus home. We were on the bus along with what seemed like the whole of the old year elevens, who were all drunk and probably high. They were also eating chicken and it was making me feel well hungry! When we got off the bus a few people got off after us and as we walked off home a fight broke out behind us, don't really know who was involved and didn't stick around long enough to find out. Stupid really because it probably ruined their night out!  Nicki, that's fine if you wanna come round Monday, just give me a more direct time as I have to check I'm not working! I don't think I am... But you never know!  I'm gonna shut up now.

         HAPPY BIRTHDAY JACKIE!    Hope ya have a groovy day and get lots of goodies! Yay! If you are not busy on Monday perhaps I can pop over after work to give you your pressie on my way to Pauls house? Would do over weekend but working all day both days I think so no time :( But yea, have a cooooooool day!  War and Peace yesterday was cool. Brought some more camo's. Slightly sunburnt....oh man it hurts so much! When I have a shower I thought ooo the water will perhaps cool it but oh no, just stings! GAH! Ah well.  Working all day today. May try and book a weekend off somewhere just so I can relax a bit. So far all my weekends off have consisted of me taking them off for a reason so perhaps it'll be nice just to have a weekend to do sod all.  Hope your day is cool everyone!

       At the moment, I'm wearing blue shorts and my tie-dyed Tempest t-shirt. I look a state, good job I'm not going anywhere. I've had a largely unexciting two days. Most exciting thing that has happened is me going to see the new Sainsbury's, which I'm quite impressed with :D  My plans up to next Friday look a little like this:  Today: Bugger all Tomorrow: Work, take my little brother to cinema to see Around The World In 80 Days :) Sunday: Nowt again. Probably tidy up my room and make a start on my homework (shocking!) Monday: Nicki coming over :) Tuesday: Work in the evening, during the day too if they'll let me Wednesday: Off to Nottingham to visit family! Thursday: Still in Notthingham Friday: Come back from Nottingham  A question to everyone:  Which celebrity do you think you resemble the most?

       Cool Jackie. Simon wants to go down park so I said may as well leave it up to Jackie and I as we organised the majority of then last summer. It was cool :) Well my week next week as far as I know (until I go work on Sat and check hours for week) is: Monday: working 9 - 12 being kingstore trained, then Pauls in afternoon Tuesday: having hair cut (yes cut cut short short, wel, short) Wednesday: possible work Thursday: possible work Friday: possible work I can't say for sure during the week until Sat. Sounds like a good idea anyway :)  Today and tomorrow I am out at the war and peace show so should be good. It appears I have done my back in somehow. Perhaps I fell over during the night because it hurts rather alot. Gah.  Have a cool day ya'll.

       End of term guys and gals. Yay. Thank God for that. It came way too slowly. I have one lesson this morning and that is geology and that consists of watching the fifth element which at the moment I still stand by as being a bad film but then again only 1 hour into it, roughly.  I am going Croydon tonight to get Jackie a pressie :) I know you said you didn't want any by Jackie you know I am gonna get you summit.   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?&nbsp;  Family then Paul.  2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  A new life. No sorry I dunno. There isn't anything&nbsp;I desparatly want. Perhaps driving lessons then a car or something I dunno.  3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?&nbsp;  Whatever Paul wants.   4. Do you give any away?  I'd give to the company or organisation that looks after the war graves. I am sure there must be a donation area somewhere and I shall donate. 5.  Do you invest any? If so, how?  Put some away in one of those accounts where if you don't touch it for like six years you get double or something silly like that. Put some away for uni and let interest gather.

Laptop for Lora's bday.  4. Do you give any away?  I'll give my parents some to put towards their new house.  5. Do you invest any?  Yes, buy a small house in a popular holiday tourist place and rent it out to people.

       HIYA, Paul - yesterday the driving school of kenley phoned me, to let me know that there had been some kind of 'dissagrement' and that they had decided to 'terminate her contract'  so in mordern language, that means they had an argument and sacked her.  Kenley will probally call you as well paul, they said to me that if i want they would arrange me another instructor from kenley, but they also said they dont know what she is doing now. I have talked with tom about this and he aggrees that she is either gonna start up on her own or join another company, and kenley aggree that it would be good for us to stay with her. so i will be contacting her to find out what she is doing, and hopefully will be continuing my lessons with her. Talk to you all soon, Dave

       1. Yes, but the straps broken and I haven't worn it in about a year now. It's a chunky black digital one  2. Um. When in 1997? 10/11 I guess  3. Personal happiness. There are some things money can't buy (for everything else, there's MasterCard)  4. Yeah. Not the two-fingers-in-mouth whistle though  5. Uh. It's possible I suppose. But I've never seen any paticularly good evidence, so it remains unknown

       Hi, I am blogging!!! I thought UCAS days were benificial but got a bit tedious, maybe 1 or 2 days would have been enough, and they could have done with a bigger BBQ. I hope you are all well, i am good. I will blog properly when i get some time. Talk to you all soon, Dave

       No one has blogged this week :( Mind you I haven't either. Tom please blog? We don't argue with EVERY single thing you say. Andy blog too!  Um so this week. UCAS, what do you all think of that? I feel that Tuseday was quite a waste as there were no art students and I really need to sort out how to aply to art colleges. I am sure it was helpful for people thinking of doing law and stuff, and for those who don't know what university is like. It was allright but I felt that it didn't help me that much.  I'm still at school at the moment, doing my english lit presentation with Jenna. We're doing 'Anthem For Doomed Youth' by Sassoon and Owen. Its all very interesting and fun filled. I'm looking forward to the English Literature trip next week. I have to take LOTS of photos and do sketches as I am doing war in art and looking at the death side of things. Oh that reminds me I need to purchase some pollyfiller to use in art... Right noted. But also one of my artists I am researching has created the metal (or wood I am not sure) images that are in the Ypres memorial. All very interesting. Someone said they didn't want to go to France for two days and walk around graves, it isn't their thing. But its not walking around graves. Its walking around history. Each grave, each man who has died has a story, each man has their place in history. Even the cemeteries have their own small story to tell about why they are there. Everything there has a reason. Even the ones who have no name. Thats like a instand story of sadness because they are lost and no one knows where.   Yea so should be good. A sad trip, but still good.  If you could could everyone do a blog please? Just a quick one at least...

       Come on guys lets blog :) Lets hear how everyones work shadowing or experience went!!  I didn't do it, instead I spent two days in school catching up on textiles work and it is looking pretty good.  I now also hate Ken Livingston. Always have really. This whole thing about 4 by 4s. There is no problem with owning one. They are lot more comfortable than some cars and yea so they are big?? So what?? They don't actually take up more space its only because they are taller. Its actually handy haveing a jeep here as there are some roads around here they actaully help getting around on. Everyone has the right to choose. Banning them are going to create so many problems. I know about the stats saying about if you get hit by a 4 by 4 you are so and so more likely to be killed because they are higher but in that case people should just be more careful. The majority of jeep owners are older people who have been driving before and so know how to handle the roads senseibly. Ugh that man annoys me so much.

       Well well I'm not topless so neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer. :p  Oh dear Lord the madness that did descend upon us at work today. We completed literally all weekend tasks on Saturday and so today could afford to do those jobs you never have time for such as: scanning off faulty goods and then: DESTROYING THEM!!! Yes. You see folks once you have scanned off a product which is faulty for whatever reason: doesn't sork, broken etc... then you must smash it up comepletely because they little pikeys can't get it out of the trash and then try and claim it for a refund. The fools. So once Lora had finished with toys and whatnot I set about on the electrial goods. Which are full of plastic, metal and other sharp objects. This left me with many a small cut on my hands, arms and face. Woo! The pain was worth the amusement of getting a mallet and smushing a kettle in one blow. Yes I really am the amazing spider-wo-man. Woooooo!  Yea so after that we spent the rest of the afternoon with everyone slagging everyone else off. In a jokey way. All rather amusing. Ritchie slagging off Lora, Lora slagging him back. Me slagging of Deano, Deano not knowing what is going on. Char helping me confuse Dean etc.. etc... madness. All of it.

      So I spent today playing with stuff, and the fruit of my labor is  urlLink here . That's right, I made a new blog, but this one is special, cause I'm hosting it myself :)  Yes, MovableType (a blog making engine) is now installed on my linux box, and so is my blog :-D  Sometime soon, when I get a PCI sound card, I'm going to be transplanting computers around. So I'm *hoping* that all my movable type stuff doesn't get deleted, but if it does, I haven't messed with it that much, so it's all good.

       urlLink This woman  posted "what she wants in a man" on her blog... I find the most recent update to the list quite funny (keep in mind, I haven't read the rest of the blog):   "Part XII  I want a big geek.  I don't necessarily mean a computer geek, although those are fun, and it's amusing to think that saying something like, "but I couldn't, because the file extension was .php! hahaha!" is a turnon.  But I like smart guys, I like men who have a clear interest in something, and I really, really like people who have passions - in other words, geeks.  Particularly ones who babble on like crazy about the thing they're into, and then realize they're doing it, laugh about it, and then maybe accidentally do it some more, realize it again, and then talk about something else. Awfully cute."   Links to the rest of the list (I find it quite entertaining):  urlLink Part I  |  urlLink Part II  |  urlLink Part III  |  urlLink Part IV  |  urlLink Part V  |  urlLink Part VIish  |  urlLink Part VII  |  urlLink Part VIII  |  urlLink Part IX  |  urlLink Part X  |  urlLink Part XI   Yes, this lady puts a lot of thought into all of these... hehe

        ive totally been undedicated to God lately. the thing i love most in the world, and i cant even chase after it. i sure can chase after everything else materialistic and worldy. as ecclesiastes says, a striving after the wind. my whole life this week has been just that. and for the most part, many of the weeks before that.   - Kevin's Blog    I think it's so easy for us to fall into the path of materialism. Holding the posessions we have in such high honor, rather than understanding that they're not that important, they're things God has blessed us with. I've noticed in my life I tend to do this a bit, but not really that much. I'm pretty content with what I have, I think it comes from not really having that much. Sure, there are things that I would like, but really I'm content with what I have and I don't try to get them very much, and if I do and they're taken away, I'm upset for a bit but get over it (IE: Guitar that I don't get back till next month). However I notice just how much Americans as a whole are materialistic. Wealth and levels of achievement really all depend on how much you have, what you have, and how much it's "worth" (how you can put a worth on things that aren't important is beyond me). Americans seem to think that the way to happiness is through things... that's why if you notice, when Americans go overseas they try to give the people things in hopes that it will make them happier.  Just something I'm pondering.

      Well, I had an interesting Valentine's Day... I didn't really do anything that you would identify as a normal V-Day activity. I woke up early... wrote a poem... was written a poem... and then went out with Brady. No, not in some wrong sense.  Brady came and picked me up around 2:30pm... I wasn't sure of what to wear... well, actually I had just gotten out of the shower a bit earlier and didn't have a shirt on yet. I don't think it's anything Brady hasn't seen, so whatever.  ANYway... we had decided the night before we were going to get a new love interest for him, on a limited budget... the answer was unanimous. He needed a new computer. So, we first went to CompUSA to look at parts... mostly cases and power supplies, but we priced other things as well and decided that Fry's would be a bit cheaper for the rest. So we got a pretty nice case, with blue LED lit collums and a nicely lit power supply as well. Then off to Fry's we headed.  Man... it was raining hard when we got there.  So, we went in and figured out where in the store to get what we wanted, then got the help we needed (they have to make an order thing for it)... so we were talking to the guy and told him we wanted 512 MB of ram (and the kind that allowed for the full 800mHz system bus)..... he started a list of ram on the computer screen... and it looked to us like he was trying to somehow swindle us out of hundreds... but that was explained and yeah... it all worked out. We were about to go up and pay when Brady realized he didn't have the checkbook for the account we were planning to get the stuff on... but it all worked out in the end. So, we got the board in one trip (and oh were we happy), then the processor and ram after a short lunch at McDonald's.  Then we went back to Brady's, for three and a half hours of installation. Oh joy... I live for that stuff, so of course I did it. So, we got in the board, ram, power supply, stickers, drives, and other random cool stuff, and flipped on the switch, and after a little work, it all turned on and looks really cool, and works really well.  So, Brady now has a new computer with a 2.8GHz Pentuim 4 processor with HT, a VERY nice Intel Motherboard with the newest Chipset and onboard gigabit ethernet (along with that 800Mhz Bus! And 512kb Cache!), 512MB of DDR400 Ram, some lights, a nice case, and then an old HD that needs replaced in the not too distant future. The ending cost for this major upgrade? $630... not high at all! And it was fun, so it's all good.  I'm going to go now, putting Debian on the mac....

For the full video of the event, check out this:  urlLink small   urlLink large .  Yes, apperantly somebody had way too much time on their hands.... and made the independent film  urlLink "Nothing So Strange" . I don't think Microsoft liked it much.

         Oh yes, my beautiful Linux shell, with beautiful motd   Ok, so right now I'm in a big nerd out phase... due to the fact that I've got a debian system (two really, one on each hard drive) working, and... yeah, I'm having fun playing and learning things on them. So far, I've not done much useful, but there is a webserver running. So, if my computers on, if you head  here  you should be able to see the basic debian "your webserver is working" page. Which is pretty nifty, if you ask me. (right now it's down, because I decided I wanted to reinstall it).  In other news, my PC has yet another interface, and is very pretty (in my opinion):     Pretty Interface

              A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs, documents, or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?"         The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.  He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has entered the mystery of the Tao."                 -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"

      So in my tired state, I wrote a poem and put it on my poetry.com thing... maybe it'll win again and get published like a lot of the others, I doubt it though.    When Sleep is Fleeting    Nothing can describe The way I feel at night A time of cold and darkness But warmed beyond belief By thoughts of you. Thoughts of letters written and paths traveled... prayers said... hopeful hearts. The night becomes a somewhat happy place Where my mind wanders onto happy things. Leaving the problems of the day To meet the bliss, that is meeting you. And when I wake I wonder If it will all turn out this way And again I pray That it will be. But I thank God either way... Here for a moment or here to stay, I thank him for what he's done In bringing us to meet this way.

      "ECC 1:2 "Meaningless! Meaningless!"     says the Teacher.   "Utterly meaningless!     Everything is meaningless.""  Don't ever say that to a parent.... at least if they're like my mom is. I said that and she took my guitar and some stuff and said "Well, if it's meaningless than I guess you won't mind me taking this.... yeah... that stunk. Then the asking for it back, standing in the parking lot while she goes around singing what a loser I am and what a hypocrite I am (because of course, my guitar is not meaningless to me and I wanted it back...)  It's been a tough morning, please pray for me.

      Yeah, this song really gives me a lot of hope right now... cause my mom's pretty much going all at it telling me what a failure I'm going to be and how I'm not going to make anything of myself when I'm older (or just telling me to my face that I am a loser). Maybe she's true, but I take comfort in the fact that the worldly measurment doesn't really matter... I'm not looking to be rich of famous, just looking to follow God wherever he leads me.   Lyricz|  4him - Measure Of A Man  This world can analize and size you up and throw you on the scales They can I.Q. you and run you through Their rigorous details They can do their best to rate you And they'll place you on the charts And then back it up with scientific smarts But there's more to what you're worth Than their human eyes can see Oh, I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man Well, you can doubt your worth And search for who you are And where you stand But God made you in His image When He formed you in His hands And He looks at you with mercy And He sees you through His love You're His child and that will always be enough For there's more to what you're worth Than you could ever comprehend Oh I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are   'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines The measure of a man You can spend your life persuing physical perfection There is so much more More than ever meets the eye For God looks through the surface And He defines your worth by what is on the inside I say the measure of a man Is not how tall you stand How wealthy or intelligent you are 'Cause I've found out the measure of a man God knows and understands For He looks inside To the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Oh, I say the measure of The measure of a man Is not how tall you stand, How wealthy or intelligent you are Oh, I've found the measure of a man God knows and understands it For He looks to the bottom of your heart And what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines Yeah, what's in the heart defines The measure of a man I know, I know   As  much as things at home hurt... make me want to cry(well, I am crying) or leave or just end it all... I take comfort in the fact that the Lord loves me no matter how much I screw up, and he's there for me no matter how far I stray. Well, I try to at least.... truly, it is hard.

      Look at my Archives....   Well, after about a year of Blogging, I've decided to start anew. Since I'm trying a lot lot lot harder to live my life in a way that glorifies God, I figured my blog ought to show that.  I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, and I appologize deeply to those I've hurt... and continued hurting through things I've posted in the past.  I'm sincerely appologizing to anyone I've ever hurt... and hoping that you can all manage to forgive me. Right now, I want to put the past in the past... and start again. New Beginnings.... those are wonderful things. It's true for school, and it's true for life.  Right now, I really feel that the song Ocean Floor, by Audio Adrenaline, really applies.  The mistakes i've made  that cause pain  i couldve done without  oh my selfish thoughts  oh my pride  the things i...  you have forgotten about   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  of the ocean floor   My misdeeds  oh my greive  the things that harm me now  they're not a pretty site to see  but they wipe away  by a mighty, mighty wave...mighty, mighty wave   they're behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  and they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor   take them away...  to return no more...  take them away...  to the ocean floor...to the ocean floor...   they're all behind you  they'll never find you  they're on the ocean floor...  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  all on the ocean floor  your sins are erased  they are no more  they're out on the ocean floor  your sins are forgotten  they're on the bottom  they're on the ocean floor  your sins are erased and  they are no more  they're on the ocean floor...    And for that, I am very happy. The wounds I have caused will heal... God will provide for those people.  In that sense, this blog is hopefully going to become a lot less about me, and more about God and what he's doing... though I may throw in a little bit about things going on recently... just a few personal updates... but nothing near what it was before.  So, with that, I'm going to end this post.

      You're probably wondering why I'm posting here again, and not on my personal hosted blog. Well at the moment I'm doing a major overhaul of my netowork infrastructure (IE: I'm installing a router), and I was forced to remove my blog for the computer I normally host it on... I'm thinking about backing up the databases though, not really sure.... I think I will.  Therefore I should still be able to get it back up and running quite quickly.

      So if you're actually here, you're probably noticing that you haven't been redirected to my normal blog (as usually would happen). I've decided to post here again somewhat, I just hope nobody really reads this cause frankly, I like being able to vent.

      "For as long as I shall live I will testify to love I'll be a witness in the silences when words are not enough With every breath I take I will give thanks to God above For as long as I shall live I will testify to love"  I love that song...  I also love punk music I have discovered. I've been listening to New Found Glory, Yellowcard (I love ANYTHING from Ocean Street), and MxPx.

      My Pastor's Daughter Nicole has been diagnosed with cancer in her lymph nodes. They removed one yesterday and don't know if it'd malignant yet, but they think it is so she'll most likely be stuck in chemotherapy. I'm so glad that she's close to Sherrie (my Youth Leader's wife), as Sherrie went through cancer earlier in her life too. Please be praying for her and her family in this hard time.

      Hotmail and Yahoo hate eachother, and thus I hate both of them. Google seems to be the only one who's email service doesn't suck in some way or another.  I've had two emails to yahoo addresses sent from my Hotmail account come back "This message has been delayed", and it's really getting on my nerves.  Other than that... lets see here.  Oh, last night at the fair was fun! I left work at my normal time and went out to Katy's and we just hung around until other people came (Katie was there too)... then we all hung around for a while longer and finally went to the fair. Marjen came so some of us (the ones who didn't want to ride rides) went to meet her while the rest of the people went to do their thing. Umm... then we went to Burgerville and got some food and then we hung out for more time at the fair. I dunno, the fair is cool n' all but gets old fast. I like the tractors though, I could play on the tractors for like hours...  After the fair we all went back to Katy's house and watched Signs in the dark. It wasn't really too creepy, and I discovered I can make the clicking sound the aliens make (it freaks Katy out).  I got home around 1:30am yet still managed to wake up for work this morning... somehow.  I was going to go to a party tonight but I think I will skip it so I'm better able to plan for the weekend... yeah. I could probably get it so my mom would let Sarah come over, but I'm gonna see about going out there and then I'll do the stuff and maybe she can come over next weekend... it'd be cool if we could keep her overnight and bring her to Church again on Sunday too.  Yeah... I'm like killer tired.        On an occaision of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak one's mind. It becomes a pleasure. - Oscar Wilde, from The Importance of Being Earnest

      Sarah! Read the comment I posted http://stupendoussteve.blogspot.com/2004/07/on-today-and-possibly-tomorrow-and.html#comments   The email I sent you was "delayed", stupid Hotmail.    My Mom gave me a list of things to do and then you  could  come over, I won't be able to get them done by tomorrow, but maybe you can come out here next weekened. That'd be cool :)

           It's almost this slow...     Today has been a really slow day. It's sad when you wish that a server would crash or a hacker would decide your company looks up for the picking, anyway due to the lack of activity I decided to write a blog post. It gives me a chance to close my eyes and let my fingers do the typing... yes, I really do type blog posts with my eyes closed, so if I start randomly saying what I'm dreaming, don't blame me.  Anyway, on today. Yeah nothing too much going on. I didn't want to get up this morning, I was so tired. Sarah and her family got home last night so I stayed up iuntil like 12:30 talking to her cause it's been so long. It was nice to talk, I've missed it. The phone company was stupid and never sent us a phone bill, so they turned off our phone for the moment. My mom's going (or more likely already gone) to go in and yell at them about it today.  After work today I'm going to Katy's and we're like watching a movie until other people come and then everyone's going to the fair. It'll be neat but I'm not riding any rides or spending any money cause I'm broke and don't feel like mooching... I hope people don't decide to go out to eat.  On Friday my boss comes back from his camping trip, he'll find everything almost exactly the same as when he left, which may not sound like a good thing but it is, cause it means I'm not fired.      Saturday... I'm hoping to go to Sarah's on Saturday since we haven't seen eachother for so long. It's not a guarenteed thing but it'd be really nice if I could do. I'll have to check with my mom if it's ok to spend the night cause they've mentioned in the past that it's easier on them and I agree... and I'm not really in a position to complain about them allowing me to spend the night (as if I would complain). I'm hoping to go cause that'd be really awesome... even though I don't have her anniversary present yet (I'm getting it next week!). Also next week I am getting my surround sound speakers and the sound card for my computer, and the optical drives. After that there will only be the two video cards and the three monitors... and of course the desk, and then it will be complete. Fun fun.  I believe that's all I have to say for now, I'll post sometime in the future.   Old men are fond of giving advice to console themselves for being no longer in a position to give bad examples. - Francois de la Rouchefoucald

      Man, today I met our resident graphics cool dude... and he's Australian!!! He had a mouse problem (that I fixed quickly thankfully) and yeah, he needed some help. I love their accents, I bet he's popular with the ladies... no really, I bet he is.  I wish I was Australian. Not cause I want to be popular with ladies, one is enough, but it'd be cool to have that accent. Maybe when I'm older I'll move there so my kids get the accent, you know, living my dreams through them.

      So events of the past day or so.  First off, as I mentioned yesterday, Sarah called. That was really cool, made me pretty happy, even though we only talked for like 7 minutes. Shes back late Wednesday night, so I hopefully can see her again soon (its been like 2.5 weeks since Ive seen her).  Last night I was up pretty late talking to a girl on the phone that has a lot of crap going on in her life and was going to use the wrong way out. It was kinda creepy cause I could hear the pill bottles and stuff as she tried opening them. In the end she was going to call a help center and see a counselor, Im going to call later today and check up on how that went man, guys dont realize how much they can ruin a girls life and truly ruin it. This girl wasnt heartbroken by a guy (well, plural), but yeah worse. Guys can be pigs.  Yesterday what else. Oh yeah! So on Saturday this person sent me an email saying I have interesting pictures of your beautiful girlfriend and one of her guy friends. Wanna see?, that was kinda odd, so I said yes. Sure enough Sunday they sent me links to some pictures Jeannette took of Sarah hanging out with some of her friends. One was in the pool and her friend was being goofy, and the other was a group picture where she was standing so close to him, I guess those were supposed to get me upset but yeah, it didnt work. I still have no idea who the person that emailed me was though, very interesting  Today is yet another Monday. I like Mondays right now, other than the fact that Im always tired. They really arent so bad, I mean think about it its a Monday, but if work started on Tuesdays then everyone would hate Tuesdays, so I dont see the problem. Today my boss is going to be there for a little bit (maybe), and then Im on my own for the week. I hope nothing drastically blows up (hmm yes I do hope this).  Woo, more computer parts should be coming today! Unless FedEx is stupid. Which they may be, you never know.

      Mmmm... nothing going on. Life's very bland recently.  Brianna called me last night which was cool 'cause we haven't talked for a while. I think she called me some other time recently but I don't quite remember. We were talking about how laid back I am... I suppose it's pretty true.  laid-back (ldbk) adj. Informal  Having a relaxed or casual atmosphere or character; easygoing: laid-back, untroubled people  Yep, that is me, lol. I don't (except for some important things) really take things overly serious, I guess it helps to keep the stress down. I'm getting to wherre I need to take school seriously though, next year is going to be stressful... but livable.  This summer so far has been pretty slow, yet it's gone by quickly (that really doesn't make sense). I'm hoping I can get into the same thing next year, an extra $3000 would be useful.  I put Debian on my work laptop this morning... man, I put Debian on everything I can get my hands on. The first Linux Distro I installed, and by far my favorite. The best part is it works just fine :)

      I must do my greatest thinking on the Max its when my mind is clear and tired at the same time.  Next week is gonna rock. My boss Jeremy is on vacation, so Im gonna be the head computer guy at the company. Means Ill have the keys to the server rooms and the storage areas, which will be cool too. Hopefully its an easy week and no servers decide to blow up or raid arrays decide that its time to give up on life. Well, Jeremys got a pretty good setup, so Id be surprised if anything other than that happened, because of course hardware failures are next to impossible to forecast.  Wow, someone on the max line has some weird seagulls in their yard, and the girl sitting behind me has really strong perfume, at least its a good scent.  I should read the classifieds over the person in front of mes shoulder Ooo, a Classic 1972 Ford is selling for only $1675 it may be classic but I bet its not worth too much.  -15 Minutes Later-  Ah, now Im on the bus. Interesting people ride the bus usually there are quite a few normal people, though at this moment they seem in short supply. Across from me in the seats is a couple the man looks around 25 or older and the girl looks like she might be 14 (maybe younger?) kinda sick if you ask me. Now onto the bus come the more normal people the preppy girls (if you can call them normal). All flaunting their looks and smiling if they notice you glancing at them, even if its just because you want to write them into your blog post. I feel like Harriet the Spy, thats kinda cool. I should use my bus rides to work on my descriptions for writing, as there are always new eople I havent seen before (in fact I think theres only two people Ive even recognized on the bus, I knew neither of them though).  Over in the corner sits a man reading the paper sports section, of course. Hes most likely a construction worked or the like, his shoes show a quite a bit of wear and hard use, and hes in need of a shave, or to let it grow. His glasses seem clean enough, as do his clothes, but his hat is a bit outdated (saying 2000 The New Millenium). The bus driver finally makes his way onto the bus, and the few stragglers that will not get on the bus until the driver is there finally come in. Theres a lady that keeps talking to herself in Chinese it sounds or maybe shes speaking in tongues either way nobody even gives her a second glance. Theres a Spanish guy across from me that has nothing really to mention. He looks like many of the Hispanics in the area, trying to be preppy but not looking the roll in the least. Preppy girls show they have some thought, theyve slightly turned and are staring at the lady that is holding a conversation with herself shes even throwing in hand gestures now, and this guy across from me that looks like an Eminem wannabe mentions shes doing that because nobody listens to her so she has to talk to herself. The bus stops an old lady with frizzy white hair comes on, and a guy that looks like he likes football. The crazy lady goes and stands at the front of the bus (still inside, but I'm sitting in the back), and football guy gives her a wide eyed look when she walks past. Now she comes and sits by my laptop case still talking in her unknown language. Eminem looks like hes about to burst into laughter I suppose I can understand that. Construction guy in the corner is leaning against the window sleeping. I would think that hat would be pretty uncomfortable Eminem starts giggling, says its a joke but its more likely about the lady talking random nothingness.  This man with a CD player that looks like he could be a software developer, but probably isnt, mentions my assortment of goodies. Pocket PC, Laptop I suppose there are some goodies, all Im missing is a cell phone.  We stop at another stop (by now weve passed a few, but nobody of note either entered or left the bus  those preppy girls are probably headed to the mall now that I think about it) nobody of note gets on. We drive onwards. I notice the laptop battry is at 77%, where it was fully charged before leaving work, yes I think sometime soon this will need replaced. Babbling lady gets up and heads to the front of the bus again, and Eminem gets that dumb grin on his face. Then she sits in the front next to a woman that would probably rather be somewhere else right now. Looking at football, I can see hes probably a construction worker too, or a painter (he has some paint on his shorts). His shoes are beat up and he has a hat that says Hansen, but not the band (probably a construction company). He sits up straighter than an arrow, probably was once in the military or something. The old lady with the frizzy hair gets off, leaving babbling woman on her own I wonder if this was really her stop or if she just needed to get away. I cant really say which Id do  We stop at the bus stop by the old Beaverton City Library this is usually where a couple hundred Mexicans get on and off the bus, but I guess its too early for them to be out. Some guy gets on that looks like a hippie and a biker mixed, with his bandana. He apparently has no idea where he is or what bus hes on, as the driver talks to him for a while. Eventually he does sit down. I notice were passing Denny road, which means there is only Hart before my stop, so Im going to go now. Hope you enjoy this :)

       urlLink This  is a very sweet music player. Made by Commodore (yes, they ARE still around... at least I think so), so it's got to be awesome.  Speaking of Commodore, and Awesome. Check out  Machinae Supremacy  is a band with a huge download section, and one of the first (or only?) bands to make SiD Metal. That being hard (metal) rock being played along with Commodore 64 SiD Chips. I need to learn how to program my Commodore to play music, all I ever did with it was some symphony out of a book (which of course I quickly put on a disk... which I have since lost).  My days during the week are pretty bland. I get up in the morning (with a bit of trouble recently, I need to sleep more) and go to work... there I do stuff, and sit at my desk, and do stuff there, and then at like 4:30 I go home. Once there I pretty much do the same thing I did at work. It may sound boring, and at times it is, but really I'd be bored just sitting at home all day anyway (and hey, I'm getting payed for this).  Tomorrow Armaan is having a party somtime, I'm not sure when or where (though I'd assume his house). It's likely that I'll take the bus to hart road and walk up to his house from (pretty close to) Adri's, which will be fun and relaxing, and also very warm if weather holds out the way it's been (Man, Sarah must be loving it over in Hawaii... and also getting really burnt).  I've discovered the niceness of headphones at work. I can rock to music off the laptop (which has far superior sound to the PDA) and still umm... "work".  As much as I talk about not working at work, usually I do end up with quite a bit to do. Like the other day I had to change a file in every computer... thankfully I can do that over the network, but it was still tedious. Well, back to my IM's... hehe.

      "I'll write sincerely yours and sign my name, PS I love you, forever and today."   I'm in a petty chipper mood today, which could be expected I suppose, as I got most of a full night's sleep. I think tonight I'll be going to bed at 9, because I'm still really behind on da sleep for some reason.   I was so annoyed at my mom yesterday. I had been telling her like all week that I was getting payed on Tuesday and needed her home so I could go to the bank and put money in and use the check card to order computer parts. So what's the one day she plans stuff and doesn't get home until 11:30? Why Tuesday of course. I was really impatient and stuff, but I got over that when I really thought about it, because realy I can afford to get the stuff anytime, as I'll be broke  after  getting it so I won't be able to get more parts anyway.   "Best friend worst thing, she's been cheating, friend decieves she leaves"   I'm such a slacker, I still haven't gotten Sarah her anniversary present. I know what it is now, I just haven't gone to the store to buy it. I really hope she likes it though... she will of course but I'm required to think like that (hehe).   "Alone with you... alone with me... what can I do I cannot breathe"   I think I fell asleep at work yesterday... like, fell asleep without being asleep. My mind just went away for an hour. It was ok though, I (thankfully) didn't get any new work to do in that time, so I wasn't like messing up on things or what not. I really like this laptop a lot more than my normal work computer... it hurts my eyes less and I can use it (again) on the Max.

      In keeping with Google's changing of Blogger, I have decided that I needed to change my template. I like it pretty minimalistic, so this is nice enough for me. &nbsp; If you hate it, tough, that's not my problem now is it :-P

      I seriously love that my boss let me borrow the laptop.... there's nothing better than riding the max and typing a blog post at the same time, even if I can't post it until later... plus this keyboard is big and non-spongy, which would make anybody happy.   Today is payday (yay!), I'm ordering more computer parts (enough to finally start using the thing!) and also hopefully getting something for Sarah before she gets back from Hawaii.  I really haven't been up to too much... the sad thing about having a job is that when everyone else has no problem just doing things at random times, I kinda have to wait and hope they plan something for a weekend, which they do usually but not always.   Last Friday night (well, more Sunday morning) I went to Andrew's with Armaan until around 5:30am. That was pretty fun as I've never really hung out with Andrew much, nor been to his house. I think he thinks I'm an idiot but whatever, he wouldn't be entirely off in thinking that. Actually, I don't think he thinks that, I just think he's hard to red so I assume he's somehow hostile. After hanging out at Andrew's, we went to Danie's for the xfiles Marathon we had planned. We took a walk and did watch a couple of episodes, but most of the time was pretty hang-outish (which is always really fun... more fun than just watching DVD's if you ask me). I think it's kinda cool that Armaan's friends let me hang out with them so much, because I don't really have many friends of my own (I say Armaan's friend's but I guess somewhere they became mine too, as we do things without Armaan sometimes too). I was so tired by the time I got home, but I slept well later in the evening.   Sarah's still in Hawaii, she left on Sunday and is getting back on Wednesday next week. She's going to call me on Saturday if possible, so I'm trying not to plan anything for Saturday. It's hard not to, I may end up turning down a party that Mandy is planning, which would be sad, but I'd rather hear from Sarah.   Today, July 20, marks umm.... some odd days until School starts (I  believe  it starts on the 8th of September). Thank Goodness I get payed on such a regular basis, as I will really be pushing it with finishing that computer... oh, and I'll be even closer to the line of brokeness as I most likely need to buy a new desk to house it. Ah well, that's the way things work out.   Well, it's almost my Max stop, so I'm gonna finish this up. I don't really know what else to write about anyway..... we'll see if anything worth talking about happend at all this week. Armaan is planing a party for Thursday, and planning on seeing the Bourne movie... whatever the new one is. I won't be able to see the movie, but I hope I'm able to go to the party.

      Ooooo, blogger has wysiwyg editing now. That's pretty nifty, spiffy, and all around neato. &nbsp; I'm thinking about changing my template sometime, but I probably won't for a while. What do you think? If there's something blue I'd probably be happy with it. &nbsp; Man, I was sooooo tired this morning. I was up until like 1, after getting home ar like 12:20, after trying to clean up something that's talked about in  Armaan's Blog .... yeah it was interesting. &nbsp; Today at work I'm actually working on some stuff. We're changing some phone ports into fax ports and going to put fax software on people's computers/laptops if they want it. It means I get to play around with the switch board in the phone room... not my favorite activity (when you go to press the wires in they spark a little, it's creepy). But at least it beats sitting in front of the computer trying to make my character counter go up more.... so I guess that's good. &nbsp; It's almost lunch time, thank goodness... I'm hungry.

      Ok, so today has been very much without any activity... well ok, there was a small bit, and I have been installing Debian pretty much all day, but it's still been pretty slow. I think tomorrow I will bring a book, I need something to take up my time when I'm not working on anything. Today we got to RMA (IE: send in a return) a huge monitor, the box weighed like 50 pounds. Stupid ViewSonic is so cheap that they make us pay shipping even on the returns (wish they were like gateway). Ah well, I guess I can't expect everyone to be perfect. It amazes me how people in the "real world" act. This whole summer I've been surrounded by the real world, during the day at least. The people swear when things happen, they don't have a problem with it... and yeah... hmm, I guess that's really all they do. Oh yeah, they do one more thing. The term "get a life" doesn't apply to these people, as their job is their life. I guess in other words, it's their carreer. I guess you really do want to make sure you love whatever you decide to do as a career.  &nbsp;  Oh yeah, Armaan got his ear pierced. Crazy kid.

        Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time. Your afraid to tell people this, but sooner or later it gets out in a bad way, and you think you screwed up everything. And when you are in love is when you are sad the most.

      Wow... the whole last sentence ("oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!") of my last post sounds like Sarah.... that's creepy.  Yesterday after work I went to Forrest Grove and met Peter and Pat, then we went up to Brady's and I got to see my baby (my firstborn you could say... that sounds too weird to say though). After a while we went to Washington Square and met Armaan and goofed around at the Apple Store. It was fun and I'm sure the salespeople hated me especially (I love it, really I do).  After that we went to Subway but it was closed, so we went to McDonalds and ate random food (2 cheeseburgers! Wow!). On the way out I spotted my old friends from Frosh and Soph years, Brodi and Sam (they graduated my Soph year). They didn't see me but we ended up walking a ways behind them, and then there were tons of people from back then. So I got to see Brodi, Sam, Jenny, Maggie, and Amanda again... and I'm sure more people that I totally didn't notice... yeah that was really cool. They were all commenting on how much older i am, it was weird...  Pat was feeling sick so we went to Armaan's and hung out there watching videos from the other night, until parents came to get us (though Pat spent the night).  When I got home I walked into my room to find that my computer case had arrived a day early... so i stayed up a little too late fiddeling with it and a laptop I grabbed from Armaan.  That's really about it.  Goodness I hope I can get to Vancouver sometime this week...

      Today at work we had an "All Hands Meeting". Pretty much it was about the State of the Company.  I didn't know it but apperantly the Company is being bought in November or December, and changing it's name (though still being the same thing). It's too bad I'm only an intern, I think it'd be cool to be here for that.  After the meeting they had cake, and they had Carrot Cake! It's seriously the best stuff in the world... with it's wonderful creame cheese frosting... oh man I've had like.... 5 pieces (hehe - there was a lot extra). I'm glad I was hungry!

      I actually had a pretty good weekend. It was busy (thankfully) and passed pretty quickly.  Lets see... on Friday I worked until my usual 4:30ish time, and then I came home. Sarah called me around 7 from camp which was cool because I was missin her a bit (hehe). Nothing much else happened today, which was ok.  Saturday... today was a really busy day that never actually ended. My morning was pretty dull... just hanging around the house cleaning up my room (it's still a mess, but I can see the floor!). Later in the Evening I went to my Aunt's and ate chinese food with the folks... Mmmm, I love Fried Rice. We came home at just the right time, because not 10 minutes after I sat down I heard my name from outside, and Peter was there. So he came over and we talked for a bit and played with computer stuff, and then he had to go catch his bus home... which he missed... and it was the last bus out. So we decided he'd spend the night (with permission, of course). Well around 2 we started getting bored, and then I noticed good ole Carinsdev on AIM. So we IM'd Armaan and it ended up he picked us up and we hung out all over.  We went to this cool construction zone and explored and had interesting exploits with spray paint, cones,  and wireless network cards. Then breakfast at McDonalds.... Mmm good times. I got home around 7:30 and went to sleep while Peter did stuff. Then we went to Church and dropped Peter off at a bus stop so he could head home.  After Church my mom went to her friends house and I went with her and saw The Butterfly Effect. It's a very weird and twisted movie, but actually pretty good... though I wouldn't suggest seeing it if you're depressed. After the movie I went to Becky's house and hung out for a while. They're so funny... they made some (really real looking!) dummies and stuck them in their neighbors living room... amoung other things. Over there I watched The Secret Window... which is a really creepy movie. I actually kinda liked it though... because I've always kinda wished the "bad guy" didn't get caught for once, and it happened.  I rode the bus home because I didn't want to wait for my mom to be done at her friends, and I found out that Sarah's bus broke down in the middle of nowhere on the way home... though as I woke up this morning I discovered she'd gotten home and told me she was safe, so that's a relief.  Now here I am at work... listening to The All-American Rejects and not really having much to do. I can't wait until payday.... I need to figure out what to get someone for a 6 month aniversary....

      Ok I've decided what I'm going to do with this place (since at the moment I don't have a place to host another site). I'm gonna use this thing to do the normal, usual, "Today I...", and the uh... other one... to talk about uh... other things ( ;) at some).  Soooo, to start.  I've started construction on a new computer that's going to totally rock... well let me rephrase that, I ordered a few components. I will begin the construction as soon as I recieve them. I was planning on getting a laptop, but I decided a desktop was more economical for me and what I'm using. So here are the basic stats of the computer I'm building:  Motherboard -  Intel D875PBZ Motherboard   Processor -  Intel Pentium 4, 3.2ghz with 800mhz FSB and 1mb L2 cache, includes Hyperthreading   Ram -  1gb (2 512 sticks) Corsair 184pin Dual Channel DDR400   Hard Drive -  Maxtor 200GB 7200RPM IDE Hard Drive   Optical Drives -       .: Sony Black 52x32x52x16 Combo Drive (CD-RW/DVD-ROM)       .: ASUS Black 52X QuieTrack Technology CD-ROM Drive   Power Supply -  ASPIRE ATX-AS500W   Video -  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX 5700 256mb DDR ram  .: nVIDIA GeForce FX5200 128mb DDR ram, Dual-Head   Monitor(s) - ( 3 of them! )  SCEPTRE X7g-Komodo V 17" LCD Monitor   Sound - ( 1 ,  2 ) Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy2 ZS Platinum PCI Sound Card (THX Certified)  Speakers - ( 1 ,  2 ) Logitech THX Certified Z-680 5.1 500watt Speakers  That whole thing is costing me around $2,600. Not too shabby if I do say so myself.

      Hum... I tend to get myself down way too much, especially when I don't even know the full story.  Anyway, Hmm... Yesterday was actually a really cool day. Started out I went to work, which was the usual (nothing wrong with that though!). Later in the day (around 1) I got lots n' lots of work so Jeremy and I were working most of the afternoon until it was time for me to go. Oh yeah, yesterday was also payday, which is good.  After work I went to the bank and cashed my check, got out money for the weekend and for some stuff I wanted to buy. I had a list of CD's I've wanted for a long time (like 8), so I went over to Best Buy and got them, it was pretty neat too cause they were a lot cheaper than I had thought they'd be, so I got another CD and a game. So lets see... oh yeah, here's what I got:  Stroke 9 - Nasty Little Thoughts Hoobastank - The Reason The All-American Rejects (Album by the same name) Hawk Nelson - Letters To The President The Ataris - Blue Skies, Broken Hearts... Next 12 Exits The Ataris - End is Forever The Ataris - So Long Astoria Yellowcard - Ocean Avenue Simple Plan - No Pads, No Helmets... Just Balls The Life Of Brian on DVD (Funny Monty Python movie) and Return to Castle Wolfenstien for the computer.  All it all that was pretty fun. Patrick H. was the one that rang me up which I was lucky for me, cause the game was M and I would've had to have ID which I don't have (the game isn't even that violent, but whatever).  After that I ordered some stuff online, most of the rest of my computer parts, a cool beanie, and some other small things. I also got some pictures developed (I won't get them back until Sunday, woohoo for then!)  I got out quite a bit for tomorrow, money for the theater and food and also I was gonna get Sarah's anniversary gifts before then, but she's not able to come on Saturday so I guess that I'll just keep it around for a while. I probably will get the gifts today though. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, I stayed home sick from work today... I didn't sleep too well last night.  This weekend is going to be pretty slow, which is exactly what I've wanted for a while. Planning things gets me stressed, though I like doing them.  Yeah last night I was in a pretty bad mood, it got better though once I did get some sleep and some time to think about things. I'm not really worried now.  Hum... can't think of anything else to put in here, I'll post something later if anything happens, or I won't if I just sit here *shrug*  Oh Pat, in response to your comment on a deleted post, the term is "dramatic", and my problems are caused by apathy.

      Don't know what I was looking for when I went home, I found me alone And sometimes I need someone to say, "You'll be all right. What's on your mind?" But the water's shallow here and I am full of fear, and empty handed after two long years  Another sunny day in Californ-i-a I'm sure back home they'd love to see it But they don't know that what you love is ripped away Before you get a chance to feel it  Back home I always thought I wanted so much more, now I'm not too sure Cause sometimes I miss knowing someone's there for me and feeling free Free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight And light myself a smoke beneath the dark Atlantic sky  Another sunny day in Californ-i-a I'm sure back home they'd love to see it But they don't know that what you love is ripped away Before you get a chance, before you get a chance to feel it  Everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time And the eyes get red in the back of your head, this place will make you blind Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine  Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky Sometimes I wish that it would rain here And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes There's nothing real for them to see here  Another starry night in Californ-i-a I'm sure back home they'd love to see it But they don't know that what you love is ripped away Before you get a chance, before you get a chance to feel it

      If I could I would do all of this again Travel back in time with you to where this all began We could hide inside ourselves and leave the world behind And make believe there's something left to find  We'll be miles apart I'll keep you deep inside You're always in my heart A new life to start I may be leaving but you're always in my heart  Now we've all grown up, gone on and moved away Nothing I can do about it, nothing I can say To bring us back to where we were when life was not this hard (life was not this hard) Looking back it all just seems so far, so far away  We'll be miles apart I'll keep you deep inside You're always in my heart A new life to start I may be leaving but you're always in my heart  I'd give it up for just one more day with you Give it up for just one more day I'd give it up for just one more day with you  I'd give it up for just one more day with you Give it up for just one more day I'd give it up for just one more day with you  I'd give it up for just one more day with you Give it up, give it all away I'd give it up for just one more day with you  We'll be miles apart I'll keep you deep inside You're always in my heart A new life to start I may be leaving but you're always in my heart  I need you now, we're miles apart I'll keep you deep inside You're always in my heart I need you now, we're miles apart I may be leaving but you're always in my heart

      Hum, I'm thinking I'm overbudget on my computer somewhere and thus will not have enough for the three monitors I was going to get. We shall see how much I actually make eh? But if I don't have enough, I guess I'll just save my money for a while, after all, with everything else it's got I think I can be satisfied with only one monitor... or maybe two.  Tomorrow I'm going to be spending a hefty amount of money... well not spending all of it, but getting it out. First is $104 for Saturday and gifts. I'm bringing $40 for movies and food, and $5 to give Sarah to turn in for the beach trip in two weeks (which I mentioned to my mom and she didn't seem to have a problem with), $4 for an all day bus ticket for Sarah, and then another odd amount for the gifts I am getting her for our Anniversary last month. Armaan is going to be back by Saturday so it's possible he might go see the movie (The Village) with us or something, that'd be cool. Maybe I can get him to pick me and Sarah up, though it'd be quite a drive... hum.  On top of the money for Saturday, I'm also getting some pictures developed and buying a few more computer things (Drives, Sound Card, Video card, and a desk). After that I may well be almost done with the whole computer thing, just getting speakers and then taking a break to see if I'll have enough for monitors or not... yes it's fun.  The first week of school I am planning on getting the stupid proof of enrollment form so I can get my permit, and then I probably won't keep the permit for he full time you're "supposed" to have it, just until I'm a pretty good driver and stuff... I cannot wait. That's why I should save the extra ~$1000 that I would have left over if I don't worry about the monitors...

      Another slow day at work. I have done nothing today, but it's ok.  Armaan left I believe yesterday for his vacation to Six Flags, and I believe they're down in San Francisco at the moment. From the audiopost on his blog it sounds like an interesting trip so far... not really too fun though. Man I wish I could go on cool vacations... i havent in like... a long long time.  I'm really really really really hoping Sarah's parents will let her come over next Saturday. I'm doing lots of work at home so my mom will be ok with it, and I've got a lot of stuff planned (like... the whole day), in the end it just depends on if they'll let her come. I don't know that they're liking me too much anymore... I'm not sure... it'd be sad if they didn't :( Well, I don't think her Dad has a problem with me, but her Mom is (I think) starting to want me not to be around her very much. Oh well, we'll get older and that won't be a problem, and I can hope that it isn't true.  I was talking to this guy today about retirement trusts... they actually sound like  really really good idea. You can stick $1350 in a trust and wait 5 years, then retire and you get $87,000, and then a check for $9,300 a Month for the rest of your life. Is that crazy or what? I might put the money into it next year assuming I get another job, that would be so cool to retire right out of college (LOL), and only have to work because I want to rather than because it's a requirement.... like... I could be a developer or something! Neato dorrito.  Humm, what else... School starts on the 7th or 8th of September, after that no more work for me. It's bittersweet in many ways, I will like the break that school will be (it takes less time out of the day), but I will have homework. On top of that I will not have income again, and I probably won't get to see Sarah as often. I want to get into at least seeing her every two weeks... I really need my license.

      Today (now actually yesterday, though my body-clock still thinks it's today) was fun overall.  The turkey bowl turned out to be held at Century High School instead at of one of the church's fields (no mud - a good thing).  I have come to a realization; I suck at football. :)  It still was pretty fun though, there were only three or four people that actually played well, so again, it was fun.  Those four hours were filled with little oddities, ranging from Patrick drinking beer out of a crushed can, to the Century crowd upending the field goal posts, to Cori ripping my backpack, to Nicole later running over it with her car.  I have some quirky friends. :)  Well in reality I'm probably more screwed up then they are. ;)   Anyway, after that Goody and I decided that we wanted to go to Fry's to take advantage of a really good one-day sale.  We attempted coursing numerous people to transport us there, and finally after much misunderstanding, my mom took us.  When we got there, we met an hour-long line which my mom (cool as she is) stayed in for us while we hunted for the stuff we wanted.  As it turned out, the entire trip was a futile effort since almost all the items we wished to procure had sold out long before we got there.  Oh well, it meant that I got to spend more time with Goody, and I am thankful for at least that.    Well, I'm running on steam, and even that's about to give out so I'd better end it there for tonight (this morning - lol).  Listening to:  Deadbeat Holiday - Greenday

      Ok, I guess I'll finally succumb to the ever-increasing crowd of bloggers and start my own.  This is Thanksgiving morning, and I'm slightly looking forward to it... We've finally broken the trend of having 40+ people over, and are just going to have 10 to 20.  If all goes, as is our custom, we'll be up till way past 2:00am.  Oh brother, I just remembered I'm going to a turkey bowl (mud football for those uninformed few) tomorrow morning.  *groan*  That wouldnt be much of a problem, if it weren't for the sleep (or lack there of) that I have been getting over the last week.  From Friday to Monday, I got around 14 hours of sleep TOTAL. Well, whatever... I'll take each day as it comes.  Just a random note:  I love Grand Prize - been listening to them non-stop for 20-some-odd hours (fell asleep to them) and... and ... oh, nevermind.  (This was actually written at 10:36am, November 28th, but due to errors on my part, I have had to repost it now.)

      The 21st???  Dang, I haven't posted for a long time!  *reaches into the deep recesses of his brain in effort to pull out memories of everything that has happened in the last week and 'a half*    On Monday the 23rd, I went to the Christmas party our youth group put on with Gwen.  It was pretty fun and sporadic - kinda like youth group normally is - hmm... I wonder why... :)  On Tuesday, the 24th, I went to see LotRs again with quite a few more people, but I woke up around 12:10, and the movie started at 1:00, so I had barely enough time to make it the theater.  I was going to invite Gwen to it, but I didn't even know the time we were supposed to be there, until right after I woke up - dumb of me.  Then, on Christmas the (come on now, everyone knows that date), we had around 45 ppl over, including the Lundins, and the [L]Andersons.  We pretty much screwed around the entire night, and got nothing productive done.  Later, on Thursday the 26th (is this even necessary anymore?), I had lunch at Gwen's house, and met her family - specifically her dad, who I talked to at some length concerning taking her to the banquet.  He's a cool guy.  Well, actually, in a broader view, they're a cool family. *If only my family weren't so dysfunctional, then maybe we'd be 'cool' in some sense as well*  hmm... wishful thinking.  One unfortunate highlight was when she asked me a rather simple, direct question - in what manner was I inviting her to the banquet? As a friend, or more?  For some reason that I still cant figure out, I balked, and offered no straight answer, and she dropped it. (Though after much thought concerning the emotional well being of both of us at such an early stage, I called her back the next day and confirmed that we were still on officially 'just friends', but subject to change.)  Early Saturday morning (like 5:15, which was bad, cause I got to sleep at around 3:00), I got up, and my dad drove me out to a starbucks near my cousins' old house, where I met my uncle, and drove all the way over to Mt. Bachelor to go skiing.  I can't believe how stinkin' bad I was at first.  I was REALLY out of practice.  My uncle is a very advanced skier, but for some reason he decided to snowboard. It looked rather funny watching him, because he turned out to be a worse snowboarder than I was a skier.  After several hours, we drove back to Redmond and met the rest of my family at my other uncle's vacation "cabin" (or at least, that's what he made it out to be...).  It turned out to be a gated 2,700 square foot house with a three-car garage, and a 100-acre luxury golf course bordering the back lawn.  The subdivision even had it's own private indoor / outdoor pool, and fitness center.  My cousins and sisters and I got little sleep because of my newly acquired Xbox, and matching HALO. :)  We went to a church the next morning, and I was so unbelievably tired, that I almost slept though the sermon.  We went back to the super-cabin and I took a five-hour nap, completely missing my family's trip to the best Chinese restraunt under Oregon sun.  Once I woke up, we played more HALO, and finally got bored, and went to the pool complex around 9:00.  After and hour of swimming inside, we got bored yet again, and decided to go make use of the hot tubs out in the snow.  We did that for about half an hour, and got tired of it, so we went and rolled around in the snow for a little while, and got back in again.  After quite a while later, we decided that the ice forming in our hair wasn't such a good thing after all, and retreated back to our mega-cabin.  Then, this morning, we got up, and went to the mountain yet again, and messed around in the snow for another hours or so, and then drove all the way back home, with a short stop at an Izzy's in Bend.  Tomorrow, my youth group is having a big New Year's party from 6:30, to 1:30 (or something like that...), and I want to invite Gwen to it.  Though there is a possibility that she's going to her church's New Year's overnighter... Something I was going to go to, but for lack of funds.  It's late, and I'm tired - need sleep, must go...  P.S. I am an anti-Andrewist  (don't ask)

      I finally got my Learner's Permit on Tuesday, after month of being to lazy to get my parents to go with me to DMV.     Wednesday (my 16th birthday) was rather uneventful.  The majority of my family local to this area went to Old Country Buffet in Beaverton to celebrate.  Fun, I guess...  I got a Van de Graff generator which, upon assembly, fail to operate.  That was a rather large disappointment, since I had spent almost 5 hours on it.    Yesterday, We had our "Christmas party" of sorts at school, and I finally invited Gwen to the Winter Banquet (after several schedule conflict which I had to resolve before I even knew if I was going to go), but now my parents are getting more restrictive, and saying that I should ask her to pay for her own ticket, because if I pay for it, it'll be a "date"...  I never really got that reasoning, but I guess I'll just have to flow with it...    Later that afternoon, Goody's family (minus two siblings), Peter, Rachael, Emily, and I went to see  The Two Towers .  It was way better than I thought it was going to be, but I was expecting more people to be coming.  Later when I got home, I received a message from Brady informing me that I had not, in fact invited them to it, though I had been operating the last couple day, with the expectation of seeing them there...  Really stupid of me.   Consequentially, I am prolly going to go see it again with them within the next week.

      I actually ended up going to see Nemesis right after school on Thursday with Gwen, Brady, Cori, Cameran, and Matt.  It was a cool movie, as far as Star Trek movies go...  I slept in on Saturday (I really needed it - had had almost no sleep the past week), and helped cater at a Christmas play done by Southwest Hills that night.  I think I ate one meal the entire day. :)  I got to Calvary slightly early on Sunday, cause the tech guys were testing a new digital board, and I was riding with some of the musicians.  During second service, Brady, Steven, Cameran, Emily, and I walked a couple blocks over to Carl's Jr. ... in the pouring rain ... in my suit.  :)  We spent prolly 45 minutes over there, and walked back.  I then donned a regular jacket in place of my suit, and we walked a couple more blocks over to the theater to buy tickets for another showing of Nemesis.  After we all saw the movie (all 25 of us), I went over to Goody's house and stayed for about half an hour before getting picked up, and driven back home.  Today, by contrast, was rather uneventful.  Oh, and I finally got Gwen's aim screen name, after weeks of forgetting to ask her for it.  :)  *Happy*  Feeling: Hunger, Tiredness, Anxiety about the upcoming Learner's Permit test tomorrow.

      Again, I haven't posted for a while.  This last week or so has been really busy (as usual).  My parents were out of town on Monday, and I stayed over night at Brent's house.  Going to and from school on Tues. was annoying cause a had a couple huge bags with me, besides my school stuff.  SWHB youth group on Tuesday was pretty fun - nothing that much out-of-the-ordinary happened, it was just fun.  Last night's CCWC youth group was better, though.  Afterward, Brady, Cori, Steven, and I walked over to Carl's Jr., in the rain, and got milkshakes of all things.  :)  I'm looking forward to the growth group I have tomorrow night (at the bowling alley), seeing  Nemesis  on Sunday, my birthday on Wednesday, and possibly going to see the Nutcracker Ballet on Thursday.

      Hmm... I haven't posted in a while.  I'm still sick, and on Thursday I skipped school, partly because I wasn't feeling good, and partly because I was tired.  ( I think they're interchangeable)  Anyway, because of it, I'm slightly backed up in school work.  Yesterday I went to two basketball games between my school and my best friend's and we lost to them (both the girl's game, and the guy's).  It was kinda funny.  I stayed over night at his house afterward, and we just sat around lazy, doing nothing. It was fun. :)  Missed helping out at church (laying sod and stuff) cause we slept in, but whatever.  I would have been really tired anyway, after it.    Oh, Brady suddenly got his sight back on Wednesday night! I'm really happy for him.

      Not much to say about today, except Rachael told me that she found out from one of the Lundin's that I used to be obsessed with her during our choir years.  Hahahaha  I think that's kind of funny, cause I haven't the slightest recollection of it.  ...Whatever...  Oh, also my dad blew up at my tonight, for reasons as of yet unknown, and wouldn't let me go to youth group.  He's been doing ALOT of stuff like that lately.  I might go into more detail in a later post, but I see no real reason right now.  Brady (my friend that went blind last Sunday) is doing really well, all things considered.  He is a strong Christian, and I am really thankful that he has not become too discouraged or depressed (at least as far as I can tell).  Well, Gods plans are many times not our own, and we just have to trust Him to work out everything for the best in all of this.  Feeling: Tired, Annoyed, and Mad at my runny nose  ;)

      Arrg! I hate colds!  I just got one last week, and it wasnt bad until Sat. morning when it reared its ugly head.   (Of course, given the fact that I knew that I had a cold, it wasnt the brightest idea to eat all those cookies last night) but in any event, my cold did get worse.  I am rather annoyed that it kept me from church this morning, even if it was just Southwest Hills Baptist, not Calvary Chapel.  Whatever - church is church no matter the location I guess.  I am really hoping that tomorrow is off school, cause I still don't have the final draft of my report done... I'm thinking that I probably should go attend to that...  [This was written almost an hour after the above]  Man, this is insane, I just found out that my friend Brady collapsed in the middle of service today at my church, with a migraine and went blind.  I'm talking to him on im right now... he's using voice recognition.  This is too weird...

      Well, last Friday and Saturday were the pinnacle of fun for this year for me.  Around 3:00pm on Friday, my dad picked me up from school, and took me to church to grab one of our projectors.  I then drove home and arrived about five minutes before Brady did.  Andrew and Steven showed up about half an hour later, and we set up three Xboxs (for HALO), the projector, and several TVs.  Around 5:00pm, most of the other people (Matt, the other Matt, another Andrew, David, Ben, Sasha, Jeremy, Adam, Cameran, Peter, and Pat) arrived. We set up the other two Xboxs, two Gamecubes, and an original NES (Ben's).  Networking the Xboxs turned out to be rather troublesome, and in the end, David and I had to go get another cable from CompUSA.  We got back, ate, and played a ton of LAN games (HALO) until Goody and Kevin finally arrived (around 11:30pm).  We then had some dessert, and opened random presents.  Pat got me a really tight airsoft gun. :)    Anyway, around 12:30, we moved two Xboxs and the projector down into the first story (mostly guest and storage rooms, the second is the main living area, and the third is where all out bedrooms are), and just basically stayed hunkered down there for about a couple hours while Ben serenaded us with the keyboard and techno stuff.  By about 3:00am, we were all feeling slightly hyper / tired - a weird state to be in.  All of us that were in the main storage area, were acting really weird, doing really stupid (or in Ben's case, amazingly good) techno dances and just generally messing around.  I suddenly go the bright idea to get out or camcorder, and videotape everything.  Before long, I got bored of it, and Ben and Kevin started messing around with it.  Eventually, all three of us suddenly ran out of the house, and up to the road, and proceeded to act out an impromptu skit about "nose cancer" (don't ask me, it was Kevin's idea).  This basically entailed us running around the 5 or 6 blocks local to my house, with trench coats, spotlights, and airsoft guns, alternately inspecting random vehicles, and pretending to be dead in the middle of the street.  (In retrospect, I'm quite glad some of my paranoid neighbors didn't see us.)    Once we went back inside, things mellowed down a bit, until about half an hour later, when I got the great idea of going on a walk.  Peter and Kevin joined me, and we walked a little over a mile to the Plaid Pantry to get some Henry Wineheart's root beer.  Then, we got the bright idea to go "nutria hunting" on the way back up to the house.  Now picture this - three 16 year old guys walking though a small park, closely encircled with several subdivisions, wearing trench coats, carrying huge spotlights, airsoft guns (which look like real handguns, except under close inspection), and root beer bottles (which look like real beer bottles, except under close inspection), at 6:00 IN THE MORNING, looking for nutria in the water.....  It's a wonder we didn't get caught.  And, once we got all the way back up to my house again, we decided, not to stop, but top go even further, almost the same distance above the house, as we had gone below.  When we finally get back, 2 hours had passed, and we had walked almost 4 miles.  I was one of only three people that slept that night, and I only slept from 9am to 11am.    By 1pm, everyone that was not spending the night the next night had left (everyone except Goody and Andrew).  We were so spaced out by that time, that we spent the rest of the afternoon mostly comatose, watching mindless movies, and playing more HALO.  Goody got to sleep around 11:00pm, and Andrew and I fell asleep, watching a Metallica / San Francisco Symphony Concert.    Zao, Metallica, and Queen are now on my "most downloaded songs list"

      Man, yesterday was  REALLY  cool!  First, we got out of school around 12:00, and my dad pick me up and took me to get a haircut.  We then went shopping for a tie (and decided I would just use one of my dad's instead. - lack of selection).   I went home, took a shower, sat around for an hour or so, had a light snack, and changed into my suit.  My dad then drove me to Gwen's house, where we had a cool conversation with her dad, and occasionally with her mom as she walked through, all the while, vaguely aware of the commotion in other parts of the house as Gwen finished getting ready.  As she came out, my first thought was *man, she looks beautiful*. :) :)  Anyway, we took some pictures there, and had some trouble getting my boutonnire on. :)  And then, *zoom*, down, the highway we went, to the general area of Shenanigan's, and promptly got lost for ten minutes. (as if we weren't already late)   Once we finally got there, we had to walk for a couple minutes to get to the banquet hall.  (Gwen was wearing a rather thin dress, so she was freezing the entire way.)  The masquerade theme was kinda funny, but cool at the same time.  Anyway, we sat down at a table occupied by Missy, Kathleen, and Jalon.  I ordered chicken, and Gwen ordered steak (which turned out to be very rare when she got it - so rare in fact, that she had to send it back to be re-cooked, and half-an-hour later when it arrived again, it was STILL slightly rare).  I would be surprised if at least some of the people that got the steak don't get food poisoning.  Oh well.  The salad was pretty good though.  Later, several more people arrived at our table and royally confused the waiters with all our combined orders. (lol)  After we were done eating we juss walked around for a while, talking to people, and eventually decided to get our pictures taken.  That was an interesting experience - We misunderstood the photographer's question "are you a couple?" to mean 'is there anyone else going to be in this pic', not 'are you dating'.  So, I answered yes, which led to a rather embarrassing situation.  (I'm not going to post what happened, but will tell anyone that asks directly).  Anyway, the rest of the time there was kinda awkward, but still went pretty well.  Then my dad picked us up, and we headed back to my house.  When we got back, we waited around for a couple minutes until Adrian and Melissa came, and then spent a couple hours watching signs.  By the end of the evening, we were all pretty tired, and hyper - an interesting state to be in.  Anyway, they left around 12:25, and I went to bed, and slept for 12 hours. :)

      Yesterday was kinda annoying in an odd way - I woke up an half an hour early, and still made it to school late.  My dad was driving (go figure).  Not much happened at school, but afterward, my mom and I drove all over the retarted city trying to find this one airsoft handgun that everyone carried, but no one had in stock.  It was bugging me that we weren't finding it, but I had kinda suspected that I would have to order it online anyway.  Then that night, right before youthgroup, my parents and I had a big blowup - resulting in my not being able to attend yg.  [may elaborate later ... currently too tired]  This morning, I left school for 2 hours after 2nd period for an orthadontist appointment.  The actual time in the othadontist's office was realitively short, but I didn't really feel like going directly back to school, and my mom didn't care, so we spent a while in an army surplus store checking out different swords and handguns n'stuff.  I was opporating really weirdly when I got back, losing my notebook, and overcoat twice in two hours...  I guess I need more sleep or something...  Oh well, I'm off to do juss that.   O, I am really enjoying cable modem. :)  I downloaded more than 150 songs and music vids in the past week.  I've developed an interesting liking to Good Charlotte, Taking Back Sunday, and AFI.  Currently watching: Days of the Phoenix - AFI

      The 8th was cool.  We ended up, not only taking Gwen and her mom, but Josh, Andy, and one of Andy's sisters too.  For the first production on a new stage, the play was pretty impressive, and the usual beginning technical glitches were just par for the course.  There was one rather humorous time when the lights went up, and the main character was standing on one of the stages.  He looked around, puzzled for a second or two, then quietly walked off the stage.  After the lights took two minutes to dim back off, the audience for some reason started clapping. (lol)  He reappeared a few minutes later with the missing prop - a phone.  One of the scenes was some character's creepy nightmare.  It reminded me kinda of the production  Eternity .  On Saturday, I borrowed a couple guns from Josh for the airsoft war, and got a ride with Liv and Jeremy, who were also taking Steven.  The drive took about one-and-a-half hours.  We got there, played several hours until lunch, then went inside for about half an hour, then went back out again for another solid four hours of shooting each other down.  My dad arrived just as twilight faded, and it became impractical to continue.  Olivia stayed the night at the location we had the war at, and Jeremy, Steven, and I slept on the way back.  :)  We were really tired.  This morning, I woke up an hour late, and almost missed my ride to church.  Gwen and her dad came to first service - that was cool, though she had to leave immediately afterward.  I got the weirdest head ach, and almost fell asleep.  After second service, Steven and I walked over to the Fred Meyer complex to look for Brady, who had taken a different street, and come back at the same time we left.  I was going to go over to his house, but I couldn't contact my parents.  I went home with the Gadaholts and Ben (as usual).  We fired off more potato cannon test booms and later went down to a lake to poach Nutria. (jk) We were thinking about taking the spud cannon and scaring ducks with it though...

      Youthgroup was weird today.  We just moved it over to Tuesday night this week, and the entire Stages (the company that's doing  The Cross and the Switchblade ) crew and cast were in the building doing a final dress rehersal before tomorrow night.  Needless to say, things were hecktic at best.  Gwen didn't seem to mind though (I invited her to the opening play yesterday, and Youthgroup this morning).  Her mom's prolly coming to the play too.  I pushed my annual insanely large slumber party back to the 24th and 25th because a large portion of the people I would be inviting to it were doing stuff this week (including the airsoft war this Saturday, which I'm prolly going to ride with Oliva and Jeremy to).  O, i FINALLY got broadband!!!  (more specifically cable modem)  *is happy*

      Church was cool today, inspite of my sleep (or lack there of) which consited of two hours of tossing and turning the night before.  I just realized that I saw Goody for the first time in like, two weeks today.  After church, I messed around on the stage which is being suddenly transformed into several streets in New York (a backdrop for an upcoming play -  The Cross and the Switchblade , opening next Wednesday).  I spent the afternoon with the Gadaholts and [a really cool guy who's in the Coast Guard, and I can't remember his name for the life of me, but I'll edit this post later with it when I remember it].  We went to Taco Bell, where I made myself mad by continuousely spilling parts of my taco on my trench coat, and then progressed back to their house, with Mrs. Vanhorn (the wife of one of our pastors) and her grandchildren.  We had some fun making very loud booms with Uncle Greg [Gadaholt]'s spud cannon, but eventually put it away in fear of the wrath of the neighbors. :)  I then came back home and started working on backed up homework that I had from before Christmas break, and that's what I'm still doing right now.

      Today was rather uneventful.  I got up, took shower, got dressed, ate breakfast, and sped off to school in the Gadeholt mobile.  Then, I slept through first period, studied through second, grabbed a bite to eat at break, sped through third period, floundered through fourth.  I rethought the meaning of life, and God's purpose for humanity as a whole, while staring at Gwen during lunch.  I breezed through sixth period (lunch counts as fifth), died during seventh, and slept through eighth.  I then spaced out on the bus, daydreamed in one of Farzad's 57 (yes, I am so freaking serious - 57!) cars (a Black VW Beatle) on the way home, and dozed through my piano lesson.    Once I was home for good, I studied the Bible for about 45 minutes, and laid down on my bed for  an hour, contemplating cleaning my room.  Finding little to no pleasure in that, I started to do random work on my computer, and that's about where I am now.  Tomorrow I plan to walk down to Andys house, and spend the day with him and Gwen (well, the day, up until 3:30).  Then, I will possibly drop by Bwittys house, and say hi to her and Jamie.  After which, at about 7:00 everyone from my growth group is coming over for a Bible study.

      Man, I haven't posted for a LONG time... I've been way to busy thinking of excuses for not doing it...  Now that I suddenly realized that my friend Steven has a blog ( urlLink see his blog ) up, it sorta' motivated me to make some changes to mine.  I'll work on a timeline of all the last several weeks, but it won't be up until at least Friday night.  I'm getting ready to go to my church's mid-week service, tonight at 7:00, and am looking forward to it.  Goody's wearing his new combat boots (lol).    Youth Group last night was fun.  I really like the series we're going though right now, concerning evangelism.  Its an area that Im really week in, and I am finding myself wishing we were going to spend more time on it.  I think Stages may finally not be using the building on Tuesday nights from now on, which means we (the youth group) will have the sanctuary to ourselves.  We had a really cool worship chapel today at school.  It's amazing the talent some of my classmates have.  Oh, speaking of school, I woke up at 7:20 today, and had to get to school 1hr and 25 mins late ;)  Well, g2g get ready for tonight. Adios All!~

      I HATE FEVERS!!!!!  I had a bit of a cough on Tuesday, and other than my chronic congestion, I didnt think much of it Then, I woke up at 7:30 am on Wednesday with a splitting headache and a temperature.  I went right back to sleep, and didnt wake up until after 5:45 pm.  I was so dizzy, its not even funny  plus I was feeling sick to my stomach.  Amazingly, I stayed awake until almost 12:00 am.  But, when I woke up today I felt miserable again.  I thought I was doing better around this afternoon, and even told Gwen, when she dropped my homework assignments off, that I would be back in school tomorrow, now though, I know thats not the case.  I hope this doesnt linger into spring break  what with the two-day airsoft war planned and all though, I may not have been able to go anyway because of my chronic congestion.  On Saturday, I spent six hours at the studio working on a show.  It was kind of weird working with the lighting and everything  we had to mask the identity of the person talking throughout the entire show, and it took almost two hours to set up the lighting in the correct fashion.  I went over to the Hakims house afterward, but couldnt stay more than a couple hours because we had guests over at our house.  On Sunday, the 16th, I got a ride to and from Calvary with the Gadaholts, and had lunch with them. Before that, though, we met up with Ryan and Neil Castro (who also came over for lunch) and gave Ben a ride to his house. I spent a couple hours there, watching Christine, Timy and Neil playing some rather hilarious games of foosball, and marveling at the pace at which Ryan reads (though Kathleen can read faster). My parents came and picked me up around 3:00, leaving just enough time for me to get ready to go to Young Hees surprise party, host by Melissa, at 4:30. Not that many people were there compared to a week before (it was me *duh*, Melissa umm *duh* again, Young Hee *I dont like *duh*s anymore, Grace, Adrie, Daniel, Butters, and Gwen (who was working and arrived at 6:45).  I brought my two cameras (one video, one still) at Gwens request  since she would be arriving an hour and 45 minutes after Young Hee, after all. The party was fun until around 5:30, half an hour after Young Hee arrived, when something disturbing happened.  I rather suddenly sank into a huge state of depression - something that had only happened a few times before in my life.  I cheered up a bit again when Gwen arrived, but as soon as we started watching a movie (Rush Hour 2), I started feeling like the whole world was out to get me again.  I dont think I ever want to see that movie again  I downloaded it off the web, and watched the first half hour of it again  with bad results. I didnt start to feel better until about half an hour after the movie finished, and we were playing some random game (Mafia, I think). Its really, really strange looking back on it.  I dont recall much of what happened on Monday  On Tuesday, I went to youth group, only to discover that it will be another two weeks before we (the youth group) can use the sanctuary again  stages just started setting up the set for their next play  Song on the Mountain.  After youth group, I decided to join of group of people (ten, including me), who want to learn more about evangelism, and still act as a sort of support team for each other.   Later that evening, I was talking to someone on im, and found out that I had really offended them at school that day, and I hadn't even realized it... that sort of didnt let me sleep very easily that night.  Then the next day, and today, I was / am sick.  *joy*   uhuh   o, never mind.

      tired..... tired..... tired.....   ... Anyway, I've been running all over the place this last week or so.  Saturday, I painted the inside halls of my school, spent a couple hours at Tualatin Valley Television while some friends of mine were editing footage from a tight retreat that I had to miss cause I had way to much home work.  Then, I went to Melissa's house for her b-day party.  For the first hour or so, until Butters decided to show up, I was the only guy among, like 20 girls at the party. It was cool; we watched a couple movies and played random games for several hours.    Sunday, I went to my parent's church. It was ok.  Monday, I didn't do much out of the ordinary.  Tuesday, I went to youth group. *duh*  Man, Stages wastes no time - they had their last performance of the Cross and the Switchblade on Sat., and by Tuesday, all but a couple tiny parts of the massive set was torn down.  We had worship in the Fellowship Hall cause the on-stage end of the PA system wasn't up yet.  This was the second to the last week that we're going through the evangelism course.  Next week we'll wrap it all up, and the week after, we'll go back to normal yg teaching. After we got out, I spent more than 45 minutes trying to pipe the music from the cd changer through our new digital mixer, into the mains. I finally figured out what setting was wrong and corrected it, right as my dad walked in. lol  Wednesday, Ben came over, just for the sake of coming over (he just started a new trimester, and didnt need help with math).  My mom took us over to midweek, and Uncle Greg gave me a ride back home.  I love midweek  it has an amazing atmosphere to it.  Josh lent his red leather jacket from the play. I wanted to wear it to school on Friday for school spirit day, but it was raining and I opted for a jacket with a hood instead. (Actually, this week was spirit week  Monday was twin day, Tues. was super hero day, Wed. was nerd day, Thurs. was blast from the past day and today was school spirit day.)  After the service, Trevor and I went out back and checked out this tight tiny VW bus.  The thing is like, 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet high. The engine block is in the back, so Trevor and I could easily lift the front half up off the ground.  The entire weight of the thing, including engine block, cant be more than 800 pounds. :)  Thursday, I wanted to help out with a show Pastor Steve was doing at the studio, but I had too much homework. I was talking to Jamie on im, and was planning on dropping in on her and Brittany quickly, but my mom wouldnt let me until after we ate dinner (which turned out to take an hour to make, not 10 minutes).  Then, I called them and said Id try to drop by today, but that didnt work since I was only home long enough to take a shower and head off to my small group tonight.    Today was pi day (3-14), and we had a party in pre Calc.  *yay*  We also had a "pep rally" (if you can call it that...) after last period.  Since our high school student body is only 130-some-odd people, it wasnt that big of a deal.  It mostly consisted of our three basketball teams (girls, guys JV, and guys V) facing each other off in an amazing set of playoffs (well two), using a beach ball-sized ball, with circus music playing in the background.  After school, I got a haircut, ran into Mr. Rivas at Costco, talked to him for around half an hour while waiting for the employees to get me some more contacts, then ran over to Best Buy to get some badly needed RAM.  While there, I spotted a tight AFI cd (Sing the Sorrow) for $6.99, and bought it.  I got home, took a shower, jumped in the car, and promptly tool 45 minutes to get to a destination (my small group) less then 20 miles away  First, my dad misread the directions (I was driving), and we overshot the turn by 2.6 miles Then, he again misread the directions, and we overshot the next turn by 4 miles Then, he misread the directions again, and in the process of turning around, he directed me into a ditch.  All in all, it was quite funny.    Tomorrow, I'm going to help out with a program that Andrews dad is recording, from 2 to 6 pm.  Then, on Sunday, I'm attending a surprise party for one of my upper classmen, at Melissas house again, from 4:30 to 9 pm.  Im prolly going to catch a ride back with Gwen and Adrie, since my parents are going to be at a bible study.

      Well, I'm happy that I made it to youth group tonight. :)  This past week or so, I have been turning the prospect of graduating a year early over in mind, but only today did I really get on the ball and do something about it.  It's a strong possibility, but I would need to accumulate all of my Junior credits during this summer, which means I prolly won't have time to do the ASE apprenticeship thingy... but, I guess you can't win 'em all...  Anyway, the school has a policy preventing people from graduating a year early, so I had to meet with the school board tonight to deliver a thesis on why I want to graduate next year, not the year after.  It took alot less time than I expected (6:45 - 7:30), so I was still able to get to youth group right after worship.    Ben's coming over tomorrow afternoon again, to work on math, and Christine may accompany us as well. Speaking of tomorrow, I really love the new mid-week service.  The atmosphere is amazing.  I especially like the "After Glow" (a period of time after the service - about an hour - where they gradually dim the lights and leave the worship team going as background music and just leave it open for people to pour their hearts out to the Lord.  It's an amazing time.  Yesterday Missy Berdan got back from a month in Africa as a missionary.  Well, it was technically yesterday, but for all practical purposes, it was the day before (1:00am, or somewhere around there...).  She took me home from school that day, and we were talking about her trip, in the car.  She had a really cool time there, and has some interesting stories about it. :)  Well, I am stinking tired, and need sleep.  Will post more about the last couple days, tomorrow. Night all~

      Listening to: El Shaddai - To Him Sits on the Throne Feeling: worshipful, praise filled, slightly tired  I woke up once at 3:00 am, once again at 5:00, and then again at 7:00 and 8:00.  Consequentially, I was really annoyed when I failed to wake up at my alarms designated sounding point (9:30), but rather woke up at 11:45.  I got up, jumped in the shower, grabbed a piece of toast, and walked, in the rain, down to Andys house.  I got there, spent an hour talking to his dad and him about all their high priced computer paraphernalia, and started playing computer games with him (on 2 of his 9 computers upstairs).  We switched over to XBOX when Gwen arrived, and continued on it until half an hour before they left for work at 3:45 (they both work at the same grocery store).   I then walked up to Bwittys house, and talked to her step-dad for a little while before heading further up to our house (Bwitty and/or Jamie were not home).  I made myself some lunch, sat around, and cleaned up the house for around an hour, before heading back down again to see if they were home yet (the time frame her dad had advised). Alas, they werent, so I gave up for the day and headed back.    People from my bible study started to trickle in around 6:45, and everyone had arrived by 7:15.  We spent around 1 hours playing XBOX, eating pizza, and talking, and spent around an hour on studying the Bible. (lol)  I think we need to rethink our priorities when attending this study.  Anyway, everyone was gone by 10:20, and my mom and dad drove me back down to Andys house (he and Gwen had just gotten home from work at 10:00, but sadly, she had to stay home).  He, his dad and I talked more about computers, then played XBOX together.  It was fun.  My parents picked me up at 12:25, and here I am, at my computer, right now   Listening to: El Shaddai - Holy Spirit Medley Feeling: joyful, exuberant, eyes heavy (dumb contacts)

      During youth group this evening, a thunderstorm that had been rolling in for several hours set forth at full force upon us. Corbin, Steven and I ran outside, and walked around for almost ten minutes as the huge raindrops filled the skies and soaked our shirts. (lol) The heat (65 degrees  warm by our standards) and humidity kept us warm, and I felt like I was in the most tranquil spot on earth. Standing there, at the edge of the field around the church, with water pouring down my face, I felt so peaceful; it seemed to me like the rest of the world just melted away for the little bits of time between the awesome flashes of electricity and raw power behind the deafening noise set forth. Then, as we ran around the side of the church, we saw, amidst all this, a double rainbow; a full arc from one end of the sky to the other, shining bright. My, what a stark contrast to the deep black hue that was the thundercloud. I was reminded through this, really just how awesome God's creation is, and through it, how He allows us to get a tiny glimpse at His majesty.

      Man, today was a pretty bad day all around, I guess.  I got up, and got to school on time (which is rare), and lasted through first period, chapel (in which Laura, Gwen and I led the pledges), and most of second, but during first break I was terrible. I have no idea why, but I suddenly felt all this weight upon my shoulders, and lost the will to do really anything. I just wandered around in a semi-daze for a while until third period (English, a class I really enjoy). Then I was fine again, and even happy and stuff, but then fourth (Computer 2); I hate that class with a passion. Don't get me wrong, I love doing anything computer related, but this class bugs the heck out of me for some reason. It's like I can never please the teacher or my peers. They come into it with some weird preconceived notion that I am inferior in all aspects of life, and don't waste any energy trying to contain their opinions. Plus the teaching methods are... intolerable. The teacher doesn't give ANY handouts or guides to ANYTHING (well, I must correct myself, he did give us a total of six, maybe seven sheets of paper this year - mostly pictures of what our projects are supposed to look like.), but makes us rely solely on notes. This would not be so bad if the guy could keep thinking on the same track for more than 26 seconds at a time. He continuously jumps around between topics, then doubles back and corrects himself, then stops to think for a minute, then cant remember what he was trying to say, and so, jumps to another random, entirely unrelated topic. (Does it seem like Im aggravated?)  Ne way, I had lost all resolve to so anything that period, and had just resigned myself to staring blankly at the monitor for the entire 45 minutes.    Lunch wasnt much better. Gwen was in a junior planning meeting for the upcoming retreat, so I couldnt talk to her. (Something I desperately wanted to do  I always, with maybe one exception, cheer up when Im conversing with her.)   Fifth period (typing) was almost as bad as fourth. The only thing I got accomplished in the entire class was a short sorrowful poem that I have yet to complete, name, and post. Sixth (pre-Calc  the hardest math course offered at our school for ones relative knowledge level at entrance) was also really bad. I got a hard test back, and found out I got a 6 out of 14 correct. That pretty much shot the rest of that period. I just laid my head in my arms and tried to shut the world out for a little while, with little success.   Sixth period, however, my mood changed drastically (maybe cause I was finally able to communicate with someone(s). For that class, Gwen sits on my right, and Rachael on my left. I spent all period talking to Rachael about intellectual stuff and to Gwen about how her day was going, and doing tons of work ahead cause I finally got back that derive to work that I had lost all day.   Once I got back home, I could tell immediately that something was at least slightly wrong with my mom. She didnt have that radiant air (spelling?) about her that she usually does around the time that I get home. Later that night, I found out what was wrong at another of our dreaded family meetings: My dad was going on another power trip and had decided sporadically that my mom could no longer be in contact with her best friend, my Aunt Darh-wynn. He was as inanely bull headed about it as he ever is, frustrating me and my sisters beyond measure, and pushing my mom to the brink of tears... again.   Yup, so all in all, today did pretty much suck.  O, and I found out that Gwens working on Sat. from 4-10, so I dunno if the movie idea will work out... So far what I had planned (on planning) to do was invite Gwen, Goody, Diane, Andrew, Cam, Josh and Rachael (Cam and I want her to meet Diane) over to my house, and then go from there to see a movie (most likely the Core, if its still out). But, since Gwen's working, we might end up doing the same thing, minus her, and then visit her later at work. Dunno, Im still thinking about it...

It's  urlLink Charlotte Church - All Love Can Be   I will watch you in the darkness Show you love will see you through When the bad dreams wake you crying  I'll show you all love can do All love can do  I will watch through the night  Hold you in my arms Give you dreams where love will be I will watch through the dark 'Til the morning comes All the light I'll take you through the night to see A light showing us all love can be  I will guard you with my bright wings Stay 'til your heart learns to see  All love can be...

      Well Cameran just left, and I'm bored, so I think I'll catch up a little with my posting. Way back on Friday evening (the 18th), [little] Sam's family and Nadias family came over. 'Twas fun - we hung out and dled a ton of songs. Later, we took some random pictures and sent them to Cameran (who we were IMing).    On Saturday the 19th, around 3:00, we went to Davisons (a really good restaurant) and ate lunch, then went back to my Grandmothers house and had an Easter egg hunt and dessert. We left around 6:30 or 7:00, and [little] Sam came over to my house around 7:15. We messed around for a while, and then drove to Cams house where I was going to spend the night. Sam stayed at his house for around ten minutes until my dad left and took him home. Cam, his little bro. Caleb, and I ran around outside, built a six foot fire in his tiny grill, and jumped around on his trampoline from about 10:00 to 11:30. All this time, we were listening to various head-banger songs (Headstrong, Still Frame, Crawling in the Dark, and others) and talking on phones (me, on my cell, to Gwen, and Cam, on his house line, to Goody). We were trying to convince Goody to come over, but he was to tired and needed sleep before church, the next morning. Cam kept shining my spotlight at passing planes (he lives right by an airport), and we got kinda freaked out when two or three low-flying helicopters started circling the area with spotlights about ten minutes later. Goody (who lives about 8 blocks from Cam) was starting to get edgy too, but then quite suddenly, they just left. I was startled when, about five minutes later, Gwen heard and saw the same helicopters above her house (She lives 8 blocks from me; about 11.4 miles from Cams and Goodys houses) Later, we put the fire out by spraying it with a pressure-washer-velocity hose for 30 seconds, filling the air with little dust particles that got into my contacts, and steam, which cut down vision to about 5 feet. After making our way back to the door, we went inside, ate some really good brownies, and started playing HALO in Cams room. Cam was still talking to Goody, but Gwen had to get off for half an hour. When she called me back, we were still playing HALO, Goody had gotten off, and it was around 12:15. I think we finally stopped talking around 1:30, but beforehand, Cam decided it was to cold in his room. He has a rather interesting way of dealing with this: first he clears off his desk (as much as he can), then he pours about 4 ounces of rubbing alcohol onto it and LIGHTS IT (lol)  He let it burn for a while (prolly 45 seconds total), and believe me, the temperature in the room rose abut three degrees. When we finally decided to go to bed (about 2:15), it was too hot, so he grabbed a huge floor fan from the first floor, and left it running all night. We got into bed at 2:30, but talked for around 2 hours before finally falling asleep.  Sunday the 20th, we woke up at 8:22, 8 minutes before the Rivas were to come pick me up. We rushed to get ready, and actually were by 8:30, but Beth was 10 minutes late, so we didnt have to after all (lol). I didnt eat anything for breakfast except a huge matzah (spelling?) cracker, and nothing at all to drink until after first service. Then, I drank three glasses of tea, a couple of hot chocolate, and a ton of water (and ate several donuts). I found out that Brady lost his eyesight again right after he woke up that morning, but somehow was able to go get to church without his family noticing he showed amazing skill by walking around the fellowship hall, after everyone cleared out, bypassing every obstacle that was normally there, but tripping over things that werent (like feet and backpacks). Later, after second service, he suddenly got his sight back again.  I dont really know what to make of it all, but I do agree with Steven  if I were in his shoes, I wouldnt go walking around like that even if I could, because it just makes people suspicious. Youth church (during second service) was interesting  dont remember anything about it. (lol) After church was out, Goody, Steven, Peter, Brady, Pat and I went across the street to the Fred Meyer complex and found Cam. We hung around for a little while Steven bought more shoes, and Pat bought a huge sandwich (go figure  hes always hungry and hes nowhere near fat must have a really fast metabolism). We then headed back over to church, and Gwen called me. I got into the Gadaholts car, still talking, and we drove back over to Fred Meyer. I got off the phone when we got in, cause I knew we needed to be fast and it was going to take a while (I was exchanging a defective airsoft gun). Indeed I was right  they were really busy, and it took more than fifteen minutes. I called Gwen back once we got back in the car, but it was quite hard to hold a conversation cause of all the ambient noise in the car. Hahahaha *Remembering the Haggis song that Uncle Greg and Timy made up and kept singing*. Gwen could hear me, and everyone else in the car, but I couldnt hear her (I tried, I really did). :)  Ne way, I got off the phone when we got to their house, and proceeded to help make lunch (really good, juicy steaks, mashed potatoes, and apple crisp), and to consume much of it :). I got back home around 5:30, and tried to call Gwen back, but she was at work.   Monday the 21st, I got to school and found out that Gwen was sick.  bummer. I called her later that night for some reason that I cant remember now  Tuesday the (oh, never mind), was really fun! I went to the airport by Cams and Goodys houses for an aviation career day (but, *wah* Gwen was still sick, and couldnt come, and I felt really bad for her). We watched tons of presentations on piloting and ground tech stuff. Then, we went outside on the tarmac for around 45 minutes, and looked at some really sweet small planes and helicopters. The choppers were tight  Lifeflight, cargo, and a couple news choppers. I really want to at least get my private pilot license, and possibly become a CFI (certified flight instructor). When I turn 18, I want to work as ground crew for Southwest Airlines. The pay is decent, but the travel benefits are insane  free travel to anywhere in the continental United States, anytime. I got a ride back to school with Tyler (the only other person from our school to go, other than me and Gwen well, other than me, since Gwen didnt go *wah again*). Before we went back, though, we drove past it, to Wendys and tried to use up as much time as would not be questioned before returning. Later, after school, I brought Gwens homework to her house (I did on Monday too), and later, right before youth group, she called me wondering about a bible test the next day. I was quite thankful she called me, cause I was oblivious to it, since Bibles our first period, and Id skipped first through fifth (out of a total of seven), for the aviation thingy.   I got to youth group about 20 minutes late (no thanks to my parents who wouldnt even let me go at first...). Worship was tight, though I was only there for 2 songs The teaching was... interesting... some really random thing on guy / girl relationships that prolly didnt make sense to the majority of us... Later, afterward, Ben and I holed ourselves up in the control booth, playing Joy Electric, and MXPX, with some really sweet lighting effects for half an hour. It was kinda funny  none else was in the sanctuary the entire time, and we just spent it getting up to speed on each others lives. Bens a really neat guy; its amazing to see how on fire he is for the Lord. :)  Wednesday, Gwen was still sick :( Chapel was cool; dont remember anything else about it at all. (lol) Gwen and I talked at some point before 5:00, when Ben came sloshing up to the door. It was pouring out, and he has walked all the way from the bus stop several miles away (he was wearing wool, so he wasnt cold, just wet. We messed with stuff, and eventually got around to math. My mom took us to midweek around 7:15 (it started at 7:00). Afterward, my mom was more than an hour and 15 minutes late picking me up... really, really, really annoying...  Thursday, Gwen was back! :) We had a test that I kinda out off in Bible... and, well, yeah thats about it - dont remember much more about that day.  Friday, we had a special chapel, and our speaker was a Congressman, or Representative... or something (lol). Plus, it was newly instituted (by the students), Caution Tape Day at school. Everything had some type of Caution, Warning, Danger or Police Line Do Not Cross tape on it. I was wearing a Caution tape neck tie, a Warning sash, and a Caution belt. I called Gwen (or she called me...) after school about something (hehe, Im getting progressively more tired as I write this...).   Growth Group was fun. My small group leader is so tight. Were almost done with the book were studying, and when were finished, were going to have an all-nighter called the Hunt for the Perfect Chalupa (spelling?), which basically entails going to every fast food place open at all hours of the night, doing random things, and videotaping it all. One Idea weve had is bringing David and Ben along, Ben playing a guitar the entire time, and David singing. We would just walk in as a group, and order stuff, all but the two of them, who would follow directly behind us. Then, we would sit down and eat our meals, and leave, with Ben and David serenading us the entire time. Another Idea is to get an even bigger group of people (were 12 strong so far... including Ben and David), and all walking into a Taco Bell, waiting in line as a group, and ordering just one chalupa. Once we got it, the person in the lead would grab it and charge for the door, with the rest of us chasing after him, suddenly yelling the chorus to Hoobastank  Running away.  After growth group, I drove over to Cams house and picked him up. We came back home and spent all night uploading random music files and tweaking them. Finally, at around 2am, we played halo for a little while, then passed out. (lol)  Saturday morning, we didnt really do anything, juss kinda vegged out. Gwen came and picked us up at 3:45, and we rode the mile or so to Adris house with her and her mom. We get there, and Cam faded in and out for a couple hours (he was sooo tired  he kept dropping random things when he was making his sub sandwich), and I was wide awake. When it was time for desert, it turned out to be a massive cookie, not a cake (twas really good). After we sang, people kept going on and on about my voice... which I thought was kinda odd cause I dont really esteem my voice to highly, but whatever. (lol)  Later, we watched Zoolander (a very stupid, gay and perverse movie), and played some HALO on Cams Xbox. One or two of the girls put on Baby got Back, and started dancing to it... slightly disturbing. Butters, Cam, and I (the only guys) kept our eyes firmly fixed on other parts of the room for a couple minutes. (lol)  Gwen had to leave early (like 8 or something). We watched a Knights Tale all the way through, starting at around 9:00 (its a 2 hour movie and  the party officially ended at 10:00, but everyone stayed around for the movie  which was good because Adrie doesnt have a DVD player, and if we left, we would have to take the Xbox with us  oh, and the DVD was Gwens). Another random note about the party: Adris a crazy pyro. Most of my friends and I are pyros to some extent, but we treat it like a science  asking questions like how long can I burn this safely without it exploding? or  how can I take the ingredients in this firework, and turn it into something that will make a really loud noise, without a considerable risk of shrapnel?. Then we answer our question. Adri, though... well, shes just insane about it. She kept chasing people around with candles and lighting things like potato chips on fire. Her mom kept running after her and snapping her with a towel, and she kept lighting thing. (lol...) Then Josh got a towel and started snapping the Adri every time she lit something, so her mom left and did some stuff upstairs. (man that was funny).  Cam and I fell asleep around 1:30 the next morning, and woke up about twenty minutes before we had to leave. We picked up Hamid on the way, and arrived at my parents church about 3 minutes late. I was SOOO tired during the service... I dont want to be rude, but it honestly was more boring than usual. I would just have let myself fall asleep like a most of my friends do (sitting all the way in the back), but I was two rows away from the pastor, so I held out as best as I could.   Later, after service, Cam and I saw Josh again, and I introduced Cam to Rachael. It was so funny... Rachael and I were talking for about 5 minutes when Cam suddenly piped up something to the tune of Man, shes Diane, exactly. That kinda took both of us by surprise, and I asked him what he meant. He launched into a detailed explanation of how Rachaels psyche modeled Dianes and left just kinda standing there, mouths open, wondering how the heck he could figure all that out so fast... He should be a psychiatrist (lol)

      Through this post, I am just basically appending the April 03rd and 19th posts. I think I may have been giving slightly the wrong impression of the situation with Gwen and me as a whole, through my rather emotional outlook on the whole thing. (Warning: arbitrary assertions to follow  standby for possible recall) :) As far as I can tell, Gwen does like me, but shes just not sure of what to do with it much as I am. The whole thing with her asking about dating another person is, in my opinion, completely justified at this point in our relationship. I just think that it surprised me and unnerved me a little when she brought up the question. Keep in mind, also, that these posts were from a viewpoint that has been suppressed for a while  its only natural, in an open forum, to give vent to the feelings that I cannot anywhere else. I may not be necessarily feeling as drastically as I am portraying (then again, I might...), but it makes it easier to figure out what Im feeling myself, by putting my innermost thoughts into writing (and, ironically, laying them bare on a website for all to see).   Btw: on a side note, addressing Stevens post today; You and Cori have known each other pretty well for almost exactly a year long than I have even known Gwen period. Its kinda natural that youd be more comfortable looking at a prospective relationship in the future But, on the other hand, it seems like Gwens looking for a closer relationship sooner in life that Cori is (dating vs. courting), so, I really have no idea. Well, I guess Ill leave you with that to think on for tonight. Sleep well~

      "See, I'm having the time of my life...  Yes, I'm having the time of my life..." wonderful song - can't get it out of my head (lol)  Back on Tuesday (or was it Wednesday...) night, I called Gwen and asked her about the conversation we had almost a two weeks before. (We almost never talk about our relationship and things involved thereof, in person; perhaps because of lack of time... I know from my side at least, there is a slight intimidation factor involved too.)  The ensuing dialogue went something like this: (please note this is not exact, just as correct as I can remember from a couple days later)  Me: Remember that conversation we had about a weekn a half ago, when you were asking me if it was ok if you date other people? Were you thinking of someone, or were you just wondering randomly? Gwen: Ooh how to answer Me: Yeah, Its kinda a tough question for me to ask as well. Gwen: Yeah, it was a tough question for me to ask too [in reference to the conversation 1 weeks ago]... I have another person who, kinda wants to go out with me as well, and I just wanted to know that if I did decided I did want to go out with him... I just wanted to know what point we were at.  Right now, Im just kind of watching both of you, and deciding if I would want to go out with either of you. Me: In a way, Id actually prefer to be in my shoes. Gwen: Haha why? Me: Well, I guess I wouldnt want to have to make a decision. Gwen: Haha, yeah youre juss chillin  We continued talking for another twenty minutes or so, mostly about schoolwork, before getting off. The conversation certainly didnt end as abruptly as the one preceding it, though it left me with more unanswered questions.  I remembered a Biology class, way back around the time of the banquet, when she mentioned offhandedly, that she had actually gotten two invitations to the banquet. Later in the period, she said that it was actually from one of the people in the room with us, but refused to say more, and I didnt push it.  Looking back on that detail, I found myself starting to wonder who the person was, if I knew them, and how to best size up my opposition.  Immediately after, though, I started thinking more along the lines of what true love really entails: is it self serving, or is it putting the other (or others, as the case may be) first?  I really began to think and pray about that for a while, and felt peace that I would be able to cope with it all, either way.  Sure, it would be one of the saddest events in my still young life, after all, she is my first love  and I use that term rather blindly, I still have not come to terms with myself about whether or not I actually am capable of loving her in the truest sense of the word I mean, well theres no question about whether or not Id die for her  Id do it in a heartbeat, but thats just a drastic example, not really capable of weighing the delicate balance between I want a relationship with her because I feel all warm and fuzzy and complete around her, contrasted to I want a relationship with her, but I would rather have what is best for her than what is best for me. i.e. is she wants a relationship with someone else, I would do my absolute best not to stand in their way. Of course this brings up the question of what love actually is: is it a warm fuzzy, self-fulfilling feeling, or is it the complete denial of your own feelings to satisfy the needs of the other?  Im looking back at that paragraph, and realizing that its more just chaotic thoughts that I have written down, and less what Im feeling in general, so Im going to write some main point that probably need re-communication:  I. I am completely and totally unsure if Im ready for a stable relationship yet. II. To the best of my knowledge and my ability to reason, I believe that I truly love Gwen. III. In reference to point I., I have truly no idea how to proceed if she decided that she wants to have a relationship with me. IV. If she does in fact, decide to begin a relationship with the other (currently nameless to me) guy, I will do everything in my power not to stand in her way, including attempting to suppress my feelings for her. (Not that that will be easy, in any way.)  Man, I cant believe that it took me almost an hour to write this relatively short entry. Actually, I can, considering the content.   Well, its already 2:24 a.m., and Id better be getting off to bed.  Since mostly likely Im not going to be able to say this to you in the near future, or maybe even ever, Ill say it now. Gwen, wherever you are (hopefully safe, asleep in bed at this late hour), I love you. Good night.

      Today I went to my parent's church's second service.  Afterward, I stayed for a big banquet they had for Palm Sunday.  I finally got back around 1:30, and got almost immediately on chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire (irc).  Steven was on, and told me about his morning... not the best... at all.  To read more about it, go to  urlLink his blog  .   Yesterday, I fell asleep around 2:30pm, and woke up again around 8:45, when my parents got home, and just walked around, in a daze until around 1:20am, today.   urlLink Mark Schultz - Time Of My Life (my favorite emo song)   He packed his bags when he was just 18 To see a world he thought he'd never seen But he knew when he met her That she was the girl He'd been waiting for  And each night they spent talking on the front porch swing Like it came straight out of a movie scene But one night she stepped out as the sun began to set And when she got to the porch she found a letter that read  You're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  The months went by it was their wedding day A church on a hill, wedding bells rang away She looked like a princess All dressed up in pearls It was her proudest day  And he stood all alone in a darkened church hallway And he got down on his knees and he started to pray He thanked the Lord for his family and the perfect bride But he couldn't hold back what he was feelin' inside And he said  She's the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give her up If I could only stop the world When she's standing by my side See, I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life  Forty years went by and she lived most of God's plan She stood alone in an attic, wedding dress in her hand And she held an old letter written so long ago But she'd never forget it No matter how old  And as she turned to put the dress away And pack up the years He was standing in the doorway With his eyes full of tears And he held her  'Cause you're the only girl I'll ever love And I'd do anything not to give you up If I could only stop the world When you're standing by my side See I'm having the time of my life Yes, I'm having the time of my life

      These are some pics from around 5:00a.m. today:           The beer bottle is actually Henry Weinhards root beer, and the gun is a P90 AEG AirSoft high caliber, low fps bb gun. (will break windows, but not humans)  Yesterday, I left the house at 12:35, drove to Matt's house, dropped my stuff off, and drove to school to meet Mr. Weber and company. We got to the theater around 3:20, with JR griping the entire way about how we were missing the previews :)  The movie, Anger Management, was quite funny, but more than slightly obscene.    After it was over, Weber drove me back to Matts house, where almost everyone was already gathered.  In attendance were, Goody, Matt *umm yeah*, Steven, Brady, Pat, the other Matt, Adam, Jeremy, Josh, Kevin, and me. Kevin had to leave early, cause he had a double header for baseball the next morning.  We got 7(?) computers up and running, and 4 Xboxs, all LANed, naturally.  Over the course of the night, Steven and I called Sam, and talked collectively for around an hour, most of us worked out, and most of us watched at least one of several movies: Signs, The Ring, Phone Booth, the Legend of Drunken Master, AI, and one other. We played HALO (duh), Tribes I / II, Unreal, Counterstrike, Smash Bros., Red Alert I / II, StarCraft, and many other games. I left this morning, at around 11:30, and have been here, dozing, ever since.

      Bored... is what I am... yeah (lol)  Today, Andy, Chris, and I brought our Xboxs (as intended) and played them through fourth period and much of lunch.  It's kinda funny how many people knew about it without the principle catching wind of it (normally even "T-rated" games are restricted from campus, and all we were playing was HALO, rated "M" for Mature).  It was kinda funny - we checked literally every classroom for extra TVs to set up.    All day (and actually, much of this past week...), Gwen and several other girls have been talking about doing something tonight, and little bits of conversation finally eluded to the fact that they were going to see a movie.  It was kinda strange, they would talk about it for several minutes, quite plainly with me hanging around, and never really once even acknowledging the fact that I was there.  Later, in our last period, Gwen and I were talking about movies that are out.  I mentioned  The Core , and she was like, Yeah, I might see that tonight.  After school while I was waiting for the bus, they were getting ready to leave, and a couple of the girls were like Armaan, youre not coming? ...as if they expected me to be.  I juss said that no one invited me, and they left. I was kinda bummed out about that, cause its a movie that I really want to see (of course, the fact that Gwen was going didnt contribute to it at all ;) ).  So, now Im just sitting here home bored (lol)  On a lighter note, Mr. Weber (my Bible, and next year, my Chemistry teacher), and several juniors are going to see Anger Management tomorrow at around 2:00.  Then, Im going to a bday overnighter at Matts house until 11:00a.m. Sat.  (no sleep, much Xbox, etc...).  Steven, Goody, Cam, Brady, Josh, and several others will be there.  Should be quite fun. :)

      I'm finally sitting down to begin another little segment of this monolog... Youth group last night was... interesting... I got there half and hour early (and half an hour late - since I was supposed to be there an hour early for setup). The sound booth was... nonexistent - we had to set it up entirely from scratch. The worship was interesting - tons of tech errors and bugs, and we stopped within ten minutes of starting, cause the worship leader thought God was calling us to pray, instead. So, we got into small groups and prayed for quite a while, and later, broke off into Junior High and Senior High. Almost no sooner than I sat down, I had to get back up again and spend like, 20 minutes tearing the entire control booth down again because Eric (a head techie) needed to set up some huge strobes and spotlights.  I just finally got a scan that I like of the picture of Gwen and me at the winter banquet, and will post it tomorrow night, when I'm coherent enough to remember where I saved it. (lol)

      Man, VBasic must really be getting to us... My computer teacher and I are meticulously going over Steven's blog's coding, trying to figure out how to incorporate an [IF] statement into html.  (lol)  Since almost  of the entire high school student body is gone to D.C. for the week, and our class was only six people strong to begin with... Well, we're juss mostly uploading streaming videos of the war, and debugging random pages off the web. :)  Tomorrow, two people from my class (including me) are bringing XBoxs and Andy is bringing one to Weber's Senior Bible class (same period) so we can have an XBox LAN party over the network.

      I'm currently in typing (right after lunch).   Pressure   There is evil all around us, It surrounds us, It abounds.  I hear the raindrops falling On the ceiling All around.  They tell me to be careful For the sky Is angry now.  Lightning flashes, thunders roars, And all around me, The rain still pours. Down on me.  Down on me, always down,  Never ending, constantly  Tormenting my soul From within and from without, It is tearing up my mind. I'm giving out.

      Another random poem that I thought up in pre-Calc and Biology, today.   Of Fire and Ice   Of fire and ice,  Of wind and rain, Scorching, freezing This molten terrain. I can never comprehend The beauty it reveals, in full,   But I know this much; It appeals to many,  But to none so much As the One who created it all.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain; Destruction and death, Desires profane. I see them augmenting  The beauty here That was displayed within. Hidden for a while  When filled with sin. But this is not the end.  Of fire and ice, Of wind and rain, Revivals revitalize The hidden, the slain. For in death and destruction,  Life is brought forth To rule and reign ore All the earth. So, unto the end of ages, And onward, still,  He prevails.

      This is not a comunication of my current feeling - at least not so drastically, its just a random poem I wrote moments ago...  COMFORT  Of all sadness there is none like this Far from bliss or happiness The world all around is closing in Turn around and see  It will never be the same again All anguish and sorrow and grief  Fall upon me as I try to leaf Through this book called the Pages of My Life  Necessity befalls me to throw on my burden Bear it as light, And amidst it all, prepare to fight or flee This coming darkness The true flame That again, shall imprison me. As I begin to burn, you need not think Of sorrow or grief, amidst the roar  For comfort this flame brings Compared to the pain felt before.  Good Night

      I'm going to copy a post from  urlLink Olivia's Blog  that I think was wonderfully written:  Wednesday, March 26, 2003   Have you ever wondered about love? What does it really mean...how do you know if you are in love...the different types and kinds of love...ever wondered these kinds of things? Love is such a complex and amazing thing! Well, it would be, for God is love, and who can comprehend God?   What about the love between to people of the opposite gender? Usually we think of adults, right? It seems to me that teenagers aren't really expected to fall in love. They are supposed to have crushes, flirt, fool around, wish for love, but never actually fall in love. Is this true? Maybe its just a mindset...we've been conditioned to think that we cannot fall in love because we are too young, inexperienced, and immature. Maybe we are just as apt to fall in real love as the ones 10 and 20 and more years older than us.  But how do we know if it is love? How do we discern whether or not it is just a crush, or that we have convinced ourselves to care for someone because we were told they cared for us? How can we know? Are we just the same as those who are older than us? Do they know what falling in love is supposed to be like? Are we all in the same boat?   What are we supposed to do if we think we're in love? It seems that the difference between a simple crush and love is that, besides other factors, if you love someone, you want to care for them, and show them that you love them, and tell them. It is deep...but with a crush, its simply based on lust in one form or another, and you want to keep it secret from that person that you like.   Its so confusing, and complex. Somebody has to tell us how it goes... We only have to wait on God, I suppose. May he tell us quickly.   - Liv, 10:06 PM

      Ah, the dating game  its a flawed concept to begin with; falling in love, being in love, backstabbing, floundering after breaking up, and repeating it all over again, but its also predominantly fun.    Think Im being double minded? Well, youre right, I am. Thats cause I still havent really come to terms with myself in conjunction with the whole issue yet.  Point in question: Gwen and I.  Late last year she started hanging around me more, and I, being of the masculine gender (i.e. dumb, adj. Conspicuously unintelligent; see stupid), failed to take notice of it for a while.  When it finally clicked *duhum.. I tink purty gurl likez mee*, I started spending more time around her too. We eventually started doing random stuff together outside of school (movies, having lunch together, bringing her to my youth group several times) and some people started arbitrarily labeling us as dating, though I didnt think we were and I think (hope wonder whatever) that she didnt either.  Winter Banquet (see my archives  January 18th) was fun, and we both had a good time. Her dad wanted to meet me first before I took her, so I had lunch at her house back in December, and he and I talked for a while.  I thought it was cool that he cared enough about her to do that, and I started to get to know him (hes a nice guy), but the general feeling I was getting from Gwen was that she was embarrassed about the whole thing.  (Haha  I probably would be too, in her shoes).  We continued doing random things together into February, though in the last month or so weve been starting to get a little distant. Shes constantly to busy to come to youth group, and we havent done anything together by ourselves at all except a U.S. History project that we worked on together. (She taught me how to sew! *yay!* Well, sorta  Im terrible at it *lol*)   Ive also noticed that Ive been acting kinda weird with the whole situation too  the most predominant instance that I can think of right now, was back on March 16th, at Melissas house.  We had just turned on a movie, and I was one of the first people to sit down.  I was just expecting, by default, that Gwen would want to sit beside me, but instead, she went over to another part of the room and sat beside Butters, who had been acting overtly flirtatious the entire night (I later found out that he was on some type of pain medication, and didnt even remember the majority of that night.). It may have been the fact that I was depressed to begin with, or it may have be the fact that I noticed Butters holding her hand for a while (or both), but whatever the reason, I just decided it was easier to not worry about it. So I just spaced out for a while, in fact, the only parts that I remember from that point until the end of the movie were several times when Gwen was trying playfully to get Butters not to watch the screen during some supposedly bad parts. (I wouldnt know whether they were actually bad or not  I wasnt exactly coherent.) Anyway, a while after the movie was done, Gwen came over and asked if I was okay, and rubbed my back for a second. I replied yes (lie) so she wouldnt worry about it. She didnt, and I forced myself to cheer up and actually did have a good time for the rest of the party.   In the car on the way home Adrie (her parents were taking both me and Gwen home) asked us if we were officially going out yet, or what the nature of our relationship was. We all talked for a little while, and arrived at the conclusion that we were not dating, but that we (Gwen and I) should talk more about the subject later. We did on im the next Tuesday:  Me: hey I've been thinking a lot over the past couple days about that   rather brief conversation we had in Adrie's car the other day... Me: and I was wondering something Me: how do you see our relationship in terms of what you would want it to be?  i.e. do you like it the way it is right now? Me: sorry, that was kinda out of the blue... Gwen: right now it may be best to get to know each other as friends rather than go into an unstable relationship at this time.  Me: o good Me: I was hoping you were thinking along those lines Me: that's exactly how I have been feeling Gwen: thought so  What was the point of all this?  Well, in our last period class today, she randomly said she needed to talk to me tonight.  I though that probably didnt mean something good, and was correct.  At 7:17, she called my cell, and we had around a five minute conversation. She made reference to the conversation above and asked if that meant I was okay with her dating another guy. I told her that there should be no true reason why I couldnt adjust to it over time, but that I would be rather disheartened at first. She asked why, and I answered because I had hoped that we were heading for a closer relationship in the near future. We sorta ended on that note, her saying that shed let me get back to my homework, and me saying that Id see her tomorrow.    Now re-read the first two paragraphs of this post and youll see kinda what I mean  Listening to: Saliva  Always (ironically the song that Andy and I kept listening to, to and from a field trip to Oregon City this morning) Feeling:  umm lol, read the lyrics - listen to the song - whatever   urlLink  Saliva - Always     I hear... a voice say "Don't be so blind"...  it's telling me all these things...  that you would probably hide...  am I... your one and only desire...  am I the reason you breathe...  or am I the reason you cry...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...  I guess that i'm out the door...  and now i'm done with you...    I feel... like you don't want me around...  I guess i'll pack all my things...  I guess i'll see you around...  Its all... been bottled up until now...  as I walk out your door...  all I hear is the sound...    Always... always... always... always... always... always... always...  I just can't live without you...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...

I can't live without you...    I left my head around your heart...  Why would you TEAR MY WORLD APART?...    Always... always... always... always...    I see... the blood all over your hands...  does it make you feel... more like a man...  was it all... just a part of your plan...  the pistol's shakin' in my hands...  and all I hear is the sound...    I love you...  I hate you...  I can't get around you...  I breathe you...  I taste you...  I can't live without you...  I just can't take any more...  this life of solitude...

The night is still young - I have much to do.

      My family is dysfunctional.   Ok, Ill elaborate If youre reading this blog, chances are you know what Im taking about, but Ill overview it anyway.  Without going into a large amount of detail (which, I would estimate, would take several hundred pages to write, or several days to dictate orally), I will try to explain as best I can some more recent events.  Ive always viewed my dad as an angry person, from as far back as some of my earliest memories, but these last nine months or so have revealed just how deep that anger problem went.  There was a time, at the end of last summer, when my mom was in tears at LEAST two times a day, for almost a month on end (this was all from verbal abuse from my dad).  To cut a very long monolog short, the pinnacle of evidence of my dads anger came about a week or two before Christmas last year.  (My family situation was so bad throughout December, that I skipped celebrating my birthday, the 18th, until late January.)  It was at that time that his problem finally came out into the open, and they started going to marriage counseling.  It has had a drastic difference, I can tell, and Im quite proud of him because of it, but it hasnt come without its own share of problems.  For instance, one thing that we have started to do is have formal family meetings to try to create a stable forum for communication (something that we have never had before).  The first several had their share of hitches, but were predominantly effective.  Not so with this last one.  We had a meeting today starting about 9:25, and expected to last one hour.  Within the first five minutes, however we launched into a trivial argument that I exited 25 minutes later by excusing myself from the table, and amid my dad yelling how terrible a child I was being, and demanding that I come back down and sit at my place at the table before he counted to three.  (Its almost comical, actually, if you dont take into account my two crying sisters, my sullen mom, and the fact that now he wont let me go to a play tomorrow night because of my being stubborn and rebellious.)  Make no mistake, it wasnt just my dads fault, my mom was the one who started the argument in the first place, and the one that was being the most controlling.    Other than this wonderful development, my day has been relatively uneventful.  My Spring Break was quite fun. On Monday, Steven came over around noon, and went to Butters house with me from 4:00 to around 11:30.  The Neff troop, Gwen, Adrie, and a couple other people were there.  It was kinda interesting the first hour or so  we were all tired, and for some reason we decided to go up t the Gadeholts house, and bother Kat and Timy several times.  Twas funny.  We watched LotR, cracking Gandalf the Gay jokes all night long, even while were watching the Patriot later.  We went to a park around 10:30, and had fun running around in the dark (at least I think we had fun) lol.  Steven and I stayed up till around 4:00am that night (morning?) and woke up around 9 the next day. :)  We went to a really cool piano shop, and saw / played some really really top-of-the-line pianos, and learned interesting, but relatively useless info about them (like, did you know that all the string combined exert more than 20 tons of force on the inside of a piano?)  Later that night we went to youth group, and Steven went back to his house afterward.   Wednesday, at 5:00, I hosted a large xbox lan party.  In attendance were Pat, Steven, Andy, Andrew, Brady, Goody, David, Mark (I hope thats his name lol), and Cameran. We debated going out and throwing rocks at windows of friends residing nearby at pre-dawn hours, but nothing came of it.  Everyone was gone by 4:00 Thursday, and I decided I needed sleep, but didnt get much.  On Friday, Brady, Cori, and Mrs. Lee picked me up at around 2:00, and then we went and acquired Cameran from his abode.  I dont remember much about Friday afternoon (but thats okay cause I videotaped a large amount of it), on account of sleep deprivation.  I do recall playing HALO for quite a while though, and eating some really rich chocolate cake that Cori brought back from her growth group.  Cori finally went to bed past 1:30 (she had work at 8:00 the next morning), and Cam, Brady and I ran around for a while, outside.  We kept going outside, and making random videos involving little dancing chipmunks, and alternately going back inside and watching random movies (including the Princess Diaries, and some Ernest movies, before we got scared by what we thought was a cougar.  At around 5:00, we went back outside and repaired a tree house.  I think we sat around bored for an hour after that, then woke Cori up at 6:30 and showed her some of the footage of us being weird that we took over the night.  (lol)  She left at 7:30, and we started riding a go-cart around. Including a break for lunch (really good homemade pizza), we ended up riding that go-cart for more than 6 hours, and we had to refill it twice.  I was so stinking tired on the way home, I couldnt think, like at all.  Cori, Mrs. Lee, and I were discussing conspiracy theories, and I had to really concentrate to even comprehend what they were saying.  Quite funny.  I got back to my house around 6:30, walked around in a daze for ten minutes, went up to my room, closed the door, turned on the tv (the stereo, computer, and lights were already on), laid down the wrong direction on my bed, woke up 12 hours later, changed, brushed my teeth, took off my glasses (lol), and finally got in bed.  Sunday, I went to my parents church, and hung out with my Grandma and sisters all afternoon.    Monday  nothing substantial  Tuesday, we had guests over, and I got to youth group almost half an hour late. So late, in fact, that I just stayed in the Sanctuary, and watched Stages' final dress rehearsal before the debut of Song on the Mountain tomorrow.  Today, I went to the dentist after school, and Ben came over late. Later, I missed midweek, so I could be part of the wonderful family meeting, and thats about where I am now.   This was finished at 10:13, but I have been hindered from posting it until now.

      Ok, this post is going to be really random, cause I'm just writing it sporadically while skipping study hall, 5th period.  On Monday, my mom took Gwen and me to the library to get some books for a small report due on Tues. on the way back home, we stopped at several animal hospitals to post lost cat signs - one of our two cats has been gone for a week. :(  Afterward, we stopped at Subway to grab some... well subs. (lol) Oh, haha the couple times we had gotten into the car before Subway, my mom kept reminding me to open the door for Gwen... trouble was, I wasn't sure where she wanted to sit, so I opened the wrong door. :) Then, when my mom drove up to the Subway to pick us up, I looked at Gwen and marched up to the door acting all *pompous* and *gentlemen-like*, and the door was locked! (She was still laughing about that at lunch this afternoon. ;)  Youth group was fun last night. Jamie was there! - First time I've seen her in almost a year:)... now if we could only get Bwitty back... (Lol)  o.O Gwen was there too finally :):) I did the overheads for worship, and the laptop kept freezing up! So annoying... 'Ne way, the Senior High youth leaders were gone on vacation, so my small group leader taught. It was basically an open forum for discussing topics that he brought up. After youth group, we stopped at Arbies on the way back home. My mom stayed in the car, and Gwen and I went in to buy milkshakes... dang the guy behind the counter was really tired. :) Interesting experience.  I'm talking to our SBP, Jason at the other end of the room... he's been living a really fast paced schedule  this school year.  Btw, my cable modem is screwed up, so I won't post anything for a little while except from school.

      Two of the most touching songs in my life right now (and, most likely, of all the student body at my school):     Breathe     This is the air I breathe  This is the air I breathe  Your holy presence  Living in me   This is my daily bread  This is my daily bread  Your very word  Spoken to me   And I............. I'm desperate for You. And I............. I'm lost without You.          Surrender - Marc James     I'm giving You my heart and all that is within I lay it down for the sake of You my King I'm giving You my dreams, I'm laying down my rights I'm giving up my pride for the promise of new life   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You   I'm singing You this song, I'm waiting at the cross And all the world holds dear I count it all as loss For the sake of knowing You For the glory of Your name To know the lasting joy Even sharing in Your pain   And I surrender all to You, all to You And I surrender all to You, all to You

      Amazing...  Yup, thats the only way to describe it  These last two days have made a change in my life that I hope I will never forget.   Yesterday, we met at the high school campus at just before 8 oclock. We left shortly there after, and I spent the bus ride (about 1 hours) sitting beside Gwen, playing badgamen (spelling?), and several different types of card games for the majority of the time. We got to the camp, unloaded our stuff, and walked out onto the beach (not just the two of us, for thats against school rules *lol*), and recorded random people doing random things (I brought my camcorder  *yay*). I had to go help serve lunch pretty much right away, so I headed back to the cafeteria in around 20 minutes while Gwen and Lisa (her best friend at school) walked all the way out a huge rock about  to  a mile up the shoreline that everyones taken to congregating at. I attempted to help out but they already had enough sophomore volunteers (the sophomores were in charge of serving lunch), so I tried to get to the back of the line. For some reason, one of the staff members of the camp told me not to go all the way around, but to just get into line right there, so I was the third person out of 145 (approx.) to get food *lol*. After we were done eating, we all headed across the small field / play structure / basketball court to the chapel hall.   Ok, hands down, I was not prepared for that chapel. I am usually a fairly introverted person when it comes to things like raising my hands when singing, and for that matter, even singing with my full voice: but not so yesterday and today... I was totally into the worship, and wasnt at all apprehensive about letting the whole room know it. (The awesome thing about it is that basically everyone in the room was acting the same way too, pretty out of character for my school.)  After a brief message from ...some people... (I dont remember who), we headed out for what was supposed to be organized games outside, but the constant shifting every hour from a 60 torrential downpour, to 82 blazing (relatively) sun kinda put a damper on that idea. Instead, people broke off into a several big groups, two of which went out and played the traditional beach football and walked to the rock again, respectively. I was in the rock group. Everyone messed around for a while, while I recorded their antics (Butters trying to throw huge sticks... or small logs... at a rock ledge more that 80 feet away, Trevor getting pelted with huge dirt clods, and people juss generally having a good time.) Oh, Gwen got a really cool picture on her camera of Grace, Young Hee, Butters and me, positioned in such a was on the rock that it looked like Young Hee and I were standing in Graces hand, and Butters, in mine.  Close to 4:30, the juniors, of whom Gwen is one, went back to the cafeteria to set up the decorations for the traditional mystery dinner, which turned out to be, not a 70s theme, but an 80s prom theme... but Ill get to that in a minute... Ne way, I was trailing behind Danielle and Gwen, who had made off with my jacket, and run a considerable length down the beach, back toward camp. As I was attempting to get my cameras in order and run to catch up to them (something they were trying to prevent by looking back frequently and running forward a little when I got too close), and something suddenly distracted me. Completely forgetting about requiring my possession, I veered left, up onto a sand dune, and sat down and started praying and singing.  I was doing this for a while (prolly close to ten minutes), before Gwen noticed I wasnt trailing them anymore, and came looking for me. (I found out later that she thought I was sad or distressed about something by the way I was sitting, from a distance... hehe :) far from it - God is amazing.) She gave me back the jacket, and I just stayed there for another several minutes before the next wave of my peers came walking back from the rock. I got up and joined them, and several of us (Trevor, Butters, another freshman and I) grabbed part of Butters stack of explosives and combustibles, and set some stuff on fire over by a little rivers outlet into the ocean.  Later, most of the guys in our little rock group went back to the massive sophomore / junior guy's cabin (actually a converted gathering hall), and watched my video up to that point, and listened to cds for quite a while. Then, we went to the senior cabins and watched the senior guys punch each other until they blacked out. ...umm... smart... yeah...  The dinner was fun. We all got into two lines outside of the cafeteria: girls on the right, boys on the left, with seniors in the front, sophomores in the middle, and freshmen in the back. When the juniors opened the doors, we realized that members of the opposite gender were going seat us individually. Secretly I was hoping that by some ironic Devine calculation, the lines would match up and Gwen would seat me, but no, when I walked into the door of the banquette hall, my arm was draped through Alis, not Gwens (whatever... it was for like, five seconds anyway *lol*).  The skit if you will was based on a prom, complete with the crowning of seniors for different things. Later when we were eating, Gwen came over to our table and danced a little to the 80s music filling the room. Hehe, I got a picture of her in the light blue green dress and that *cute* little pigtail or whatever that she was wearing off to the side of her hair.   Later, we had another chapel that was really my highlight of the trip. You could almost feel the Spirit of Christ flowing through the room as a tangible entity... I was completely broken down at one point, kneeling before the alter, with my face on the ground, weeping, crying out to God, begging Him to lift this burden of thoughts and deeds off my back. As I was singing again, I felt a sudden peace rush over me, and a wonderful feeling of ease and comfort and the knowledge that God was there to help me (Me, o wretched sinner that I am... to think that Hed love me... I cannot even begin to fathom it.). As soon as this happened, I couldnt stop thanking God, it was like I literally couldnt stop. I gave no heed to what was going on around me; singing or praying or both, I dont remember, but I just kept praising God under my breathe for what seemed like seconds, but Gwen told me later that it was quite a while.   I cant remember right now exactly when our Student-Body-Presidents sermon was, in relation to the worship, but it was really cool. He was talking about how Jesus has called us individually to Him, and how His word should he like honey to our eyes. We should treat it as such  hungering and thirsting for it as we do for our physical food. He had a couple honey jars (jugs, pots, little plastic things that you squeeze?) passed around the room, and we were supposed to put a drop on our finger and lick it off when he said too. The illustration behind this was another illustration - apparently when young Jewish children would start to memorize the Torah (at age 5 or 6 or something...) the Rabbis would coat their slates in honey to represent physically, what we should think about what it teaches us spiritually.  Once he was done, we continued worshiping till around 11:30, and broke off the get some snacks and other things, the go to bed. I was still in a daze from the singing, and just got out the door, closed my eyes, and walked, thinking about the night. Next thing I know, I was at the base of the massive sand dune that borders the beach. I walked up it and just gazed at the water for a time, then headed back to my cabin, then to the cafeteria to grab some apples, then back into the fellowship room to grab all the stuff I left in there, then said goodnight to Gwen, and headed back to out mega cabin.   I finally got to sleep about on 1 hours later, when we duct taped Alexs mouth shut, and his hands and feet together.  I woke up at 6:30, got up, got dressed, and headed over the cafeteria for Chi Alpha (the schools bible study that usually meets on Thursday mornings). Once that was over, I ate breakfast, went for a run on the beach, and made a trip back to our cabin. Once I got back to the cafeteria, I immediately noticed that Gwen was  finally  up (well, she has an excuse  she took a shower). We got over to the chapel, where we spent not 1 as originally intended, but three hours, during which, we had even more worship, and this really tight bus drive named Roland played his harmonica with the band.  Then we made the speediest exit in Faith Bible history (after the longest chapel in Faith Bible history, on a retreat with the least amount of people not there in Faith Bible history), packing, taking pictures on the sand dune, cleaning the cabins, loading the U-Haul, and boarding the buses all in under 25 minutes.  Once we were clear of Wi-Ne-Ma soil, we headed north several miles to Tillamook, home of the Tillamook Cheese Factory. We at lunch in the Factory (which is actually a museum of cheese, and once again, I found it funny that we completely overran the place with Faith Kids. :)   Hehe, I got some good pictures of Gwen, with sunglasses on, sticking her tongue full of ice cream, out at the video camera.  On the bus ride home, I sat beside Gwen again, playing more card games and other random things. Oh, Butters and Josiah were on one of the other busses (there were four total), and we made use of my and Josiahs FRS radios to talk to each other the entire way home.   ________________________________________________________    Something offhand that stood out to me was a comment that Gwen made on the bus on the way back home: Adam was really tired, and was sitting in the isle beside Gwen, resting his head on her leg. She had been bending down rubbing his hair and massaging his back for quite a while, and she randomly looked up at me and said something along the lines of: Armaan, dont get jealous, Ive massaged your back too before. She meant it in jest, I know, and, if I remember correctly, she was also wrong  she hasnt given me a backrub before (...well, except at Young Hees party, but that was only enough time for her to ask me if I was ok, and me to lie in response that I was). But, no matter whether she was right or not, it got me thinking about us over the last day or so. Id hugged her three times in less than an hour (and we never hug  we may have done it six times since weve known each other), and throughout the retreat, she had been acting affectionate toward other guys (mostly comforting them during worship), and now she was giving Adam a backrub. ...ok anyway... the point Im trying to make is this: There was that retarded micro paranoia of mine about showing physical affection toward her that I think I might have suddenly gotten over, and then there was that stupid territorial mentality that had been keeping me distant whenever she was interacting a large amount with other guys, that God, I think, helped me through too.   Oh, one other slightly insightful random thing that I wanted to mention: When I got into the chapel this morning, I was looking around for a little while, and couldnt find Gwen, so I sat down in the back row like wed been doing before. Lisa noticed me sitting back there, by myself, and invited me to sit with her and Adam, so I switched spots to sit there. Then, looking around the room from my new vantage point, I spotted Gwen, but she already had Josh (a senior) and Young Hee sitting beside her. I juss assumed that she didnt want to sit by me, like sometimes happens in the chapels at school, so didnt do anything. Later though, after chapel she acting indignant - almost annoyed that I didnt sit beside her. That was kinda the first direct indication Id gotten in a while that she wasnt just putting up with me sitting next to her all the time, but that she actually wanted me too, so that sorta made my day slightly happier (how it got happier from what it was, I do not know... maybe happy is relative - you can always have more... hmmm must ponder that.  On a similar note, I had a great time at Gwens youth group on Wednesday. I met Kevin and we seemed to hit it off without a problem (at least I like him...). *lol* I also met several other of Gwens friends, one of whom offered me a Krispy Kreme doughnut, and another, slightly quirkier one, who seemed to have a controversial opinion on... well, everything (lol). I prolly wasnt helping much though, since I was so tired, and would say stupid things that would egg her on. Worship was sweet, and the teaching was tight. We watched two video clips: part of some REALLY random movie, and part of Braveheart. Her mom came to pick us up, and as we left, I waved to Kevin, and he waved back, smiling.  Funny, even I, in all my optimism, didnt think the night would end that way. (Well actually, it didnt end there  Gwen still had to ask her mom if I could come over and help her make brownies, her mom still had to say that she was too tired and take me home, and Gwen still had to come in for a couple minutes and say hi to my mom before she could leave, and the night would really be over) *lol*   Ok, Im really dizzy for lack of sleep, and even though this says that Im posting on Friday, I added a ton of stuff, and finished at 2:16 a.m. Saturday.

      Some random quotes from an email that Brianna sent me:  "You don't love a woman because she is beautiful, but she is beautiful because you love her." -Unknown "If you love somebody, let them go. If they return, they were always yours. If they don't, they never were." -Unknown "Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get, it's what you are expected to give -- which is everything." -Unknown "We perceive when love begins and when it declines by our embarrassment when alone together." -La Bruyere "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain." -Leo Buscaglia "Sympathy constitutes friendship; but in love there is a sort of antipathy, or opposing passion. Each strives to be the other, and both together make up one whole." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "All thoughts, all passions, all delights Whatever stirs this mortal frame All are but ministers of Love And feed His sacred flame." -Samuel Taylor Coleridge "Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never." -Charles Caleb Colton "Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love says 'I need you because I love you.'" -Erich Fromm "Looking back, I have this to regret, that too often when I loved, I did not say so." -David Grayson "At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet." -Plato  These two are powerful: "Absence is to love what wind is to fire; it extinguishes the small, it enkindles the great." -Comte DeBussy-Rabutin "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." -Mother Theresa

      O.o  I love that song that Steven posted on  urlLink his blog     urlLink Blessed Union Of Souls - Hey Leonardo (She Likes Me For Me)   She don't care about my car  She don't care about my money  And that's real good because I don't got alot to spend  But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin'   She likes me for me  Not because I look like Tyson Beckford  With the charm of Robert Redford  Oozing out my ears  But what she sees  Are my faults and indecisions  My insecure conditions  And the tears upon the pillow that I shed   She don't care about my big screen  Or my collection of DVD's  Things like that just never mattered much to her  Plus she don't watch to much t.v.   And she don't care that I can fly her  To places she ain't never been  But if she really wants to go  I think deep down she knows that  All she has to say is when   She likes me for me  Not because I hang with Leonardo  Or that guy who played in "Fargo"  I think his name is Steve  She's the one for me  And I just can't live without her  My arms belong around her  And I'm so glad I found her once again   And I'm so glad I found her once again  And I'm so glad I found her once again  Gazing at the ceiling  as we entertain our feelings in the dark  The things that we're afraid of are gonna show us  what we're made of in the end   She likes me for me  Not because I sing like Pavarotti  Or because I am such a hottie  I like her for her  Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford  She has got so much to offer  Why does she waste all her time with me  There must be something there that I don't see   She likes me for me  Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy  Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey  Unlike the Cable Guy  But what she sees  Is that I can't live without her  My arms belong around her  And I'm so glad I found her once again  Found her once again  I'm so glad I found her once again  On again

      Listening to: Chevelle - Closure. Feeling: apathetic, slightly bored, ineffectual.  I woke up the first time around 7:10 this morning and drifted in and out of consciousness for around 2 hours, and finally got up when my dad got back home from a meeting.  He took me out to get a haircut for my schools upcoming retreat to Wi-Ne-Ma on the beach. I got home around 11:30, took a shower, ate lunch, and headed back out the door for a piano recital. I came into that fairly unprepared, but surprised myself by doing a better job than I thought I would. I got back here about half an hour ago, and immediately got into Youthfire Chat (chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire, or  urlLink here  for all those people out there without an IRC client). I'm signed in for about  of every day as The_Fire_Breathes.  Let me see here... *sits back and tries to recall the events of the last week or so...   The trip to Wi-Ne-Ma is next Thursday and Friday. For both the trips per year, one of the upper classes hosts the dinner on Thursday night. The fall on is the seniors, The Spring one (this next one) is the juniors.  It was quite funny last year: I was only taking two classes, and naturally, I wasnt as up on the proceedings of the school as everyone else was, plus a lot of people didnt know me. So, when I wandered into the meeting room that the juniors were setting up, no one questioned me, and I had no reason to assume that I wasnt supposed to be there. I just hung out the entire time that they were setting up, and it took me until after all the other classes were formally ushered in, to realize that I wasnt supposed to be there :)  Anyway, the juniors have been confining themselves into one classroom during lunch, more often than not over the last three weeks, and Im really interested in what theyre going to have set up.  Josh and I might make a Piccolo-Pete bomb and bring it, but we dont know yet... I got a new 1,000,000 candle power spotlight on top of the other identical one, and the 3,000,000 candle power one that I already have. I might get a 6 cell MagLite, and high intensity LED headset before then too. Oh, yeah... back to pyrotechnics... modded lighters, WD-40, small street firecrackers, and possibly some air horns (not really pyrotechnical, but theyre still stinkin fun).  Student council elections were several days ago, and I wanted to run, but I decided not too since I still wasnt sure if I was going to be a junior or senior next year. (I have finally decided to take a huge burden off my shoulders over the summer by not graduating a year early, but I didnt decide until two days after the elections.) Im going to hate myself throughout the entirety of this upcoming school year, for that decision, but I think its for the better in the long run.

      Whats been going on over the past week? Hmm I think Ill start with the more recent events that I remember more about.  1. Gwens on a several-week long mission trip up to a Native American reservation up in a southern province of Canada with her church. She left around 6:00 am, Friday morning, and is getting back mid-July. I was hoping to spend a while talking to her on Thursday night, but it didnt work too well: My dad had previously decided that if my room wasnt clean in the morning, I would have to forfeit phone usage that evening. That was... kinda fine with me, but thats beside the point. I had told him the night before, that even if my room wasnt clean, I still wanted to use the phone because it would be the last time Id be able to talk to Gwen in three weeks. He agreed, but I eventually did get time to clean my room anyway. The next morning, he said it looked clean, but it could use a little more work later. Then, that evening, about ten minutes after Gwen called me, he yelled down at me from the landing above our office to get off the phone and that he had told me not to be on it. I tried to call up to him that that wasnt what he had communicated to me several times beforehand, but he wouldnt listen He kept telling me simply to get off and not use it again the entire night, and when I would ask him why he would just reply by yelling louder at me. I started yelling back at him and this went on and on for a while, until he just turned around and slammed the door behind him as he stomped into his room. I realize now that I prolly shouldnt have been yelling back at him, especially with Gwen on the phone still, and I need to apologize to her when I talk to her again. Anyway, she and I resumed talking again, but less than ten minutes later, he picked up his phone and demanded why I was still on: launching into this entire campaign about how rebellious I was being and that we had agreed that this was a punishment for not keeping my room clean (something we have, in fact not done) and just generally going on and on about how bad I was. Finally I convinced him that I was going to get off and he hung up. Not more than two seconds later though, he picked up the phone again and started yelling at me again that I wasnt off yet and that he needed to use the phone. After a little while, he got off again and Gwen and I said a rather awkward goodbye, and that was it. Well, thats my dad for yah.  2. I went JETSKIING all day Saturday with my uncle. :) :)  I got up around 8:00 to be ready to go by 9:30, but my mom randomly came up with an hour-an-a-half worth or work to do before I could go (vacuuming the entire house and such), so we actually got going around 11. We walked around downtown and went back to his house where we listened to some Red Hot Chili Peppers on his 15 grand high end stereo system (fricken purest tone Ive ever heard from a recording). Later, we met up with his girlfriends family on the Columbia River and enjoyed a LONG afternoon from 1 till past 9 of jetskiing and wonderful Russian fish and stuff. (her familys all Russian). After sundown, the river (more than a mile wide) was sooo calm. We could push 50mph for an easy 2 mile stretch without getting bumped around too much.   3. I went to Camerans house after church with Steven and Brady today (well, now actually yesterday). We mostly juss hung out, swam, played Halo and jumped on his trampoline. Twas quite fun. Toward 8 or so, we walked (me and Steven barefoot) over to my best friend, Goodys house and sat around outside for like twenty minutes and walked back. Later, my mom and my aunt picked me and Steven up and took us to home after Taco Bell. We were talking about this one abuse support group that Steven and I are thinking about joining, and Im finding myself more interested in it day by day. Whatever well see what comes of it Oh yeah, and there was some huge issue that went on at home today again, that basically necessitated my mom leaving and hiding out somewhere from right after church (like 1-ish) till when we finally got back home (like 11:00). Man, I wish more than anything that my family problems would just disappear and that wed be a normal healthy family, but I dont ever even see that as a possibility until way way after Ive moved out. It saddens me.  Goodnight all, and sleep well. (especially Gwen)

      You know, in looking back on this past school year with Gwen, Ive come to the rather stark realization of how strangle Ive acted when at school. Let me preclude this by saying that these last 12 months have been the most stressful in my entire life. Bearing that in mind, I can begin to see just how radically different my mannerisms no, my personality was affected. All the tension and pressure was constantly building up at home, growing greater and greater every day I felt with every turn of the second hand on the clock I was being crushed enveloped in despair, entwined in regret, torn between conflicts of my conscience and my love for both my parents, warranted or not, it was there to stay. Crushing, crushing, always crushing, never letting up, compressing my being into a tiny ego incapable of feeling emotion because of some self-inflicted wall that I put up that kept me from getting close to anyone. Through all of this, school was my only constant my only vent and how did I vent all this emotional stress? By closing myself up and pulling back from all around me, of course. I was a walking, living, breathing, pile of depressed flesh nothing more. Trouble was, I had become VERY good at hiding it over the years, and to a person that did not know me exceedingly well, I was fine. I was wallowing through school (or lack there of I didnt try at all the entire year: barely squeaking by with a GPA for the year of 3.14) for the first several months until around November or something when I started to get to know Gwen better To this day I still cant remember who started going out of their way to spend more time with the other and get to know them, but Im fairly sure it was her, being as my emotional state and corresponding people skills were hovering very slightly above that of a rocks. Man, shes been such a blessing to life in more ways than I will probably ever know. Whether she knows it or not, she was the one person who was able to break through my massive facade, that huge false pretense that all was well with me, and start to brighten my life. It wasnt like it was a drastic change all at once: no, it was more a gradual breaking away from that impersonal shell that I felt acted as a shield to me. In the latter months right before school ended, this resulted in me acting openly depressed and hard to live with (annoying and such) something Im not proud of but I guess thats what it took to break me out of the bleak barrier that I was cowering under. As I said before, Gods really blessed me with her, and Ive never really communicated that to her. I love her with all my heart, but I still have a ton of lingering interpersonal issue that prevent me from telling her how I really feel about her, no matter how much my heart yearns for me too I want to scream my love for her, but I guess this blog is the closest Ill be able to come to that for a while I guess through all the suffering and tribulation Ive been going through does have a purpose, though I certainly cant see it no matter how far ahead I strain to peer into the far reaches of time and find that more and more, I have to rely on God.  Ok, this post was really random, and prolly doesnt flow well Summary: I love Gwen and Ive never told her how much of an impact shes had on my life in the last several months.

      More country music...   Concrete Angel   She walks to school with the lunch she packed Nobody knows what she's holdin' back Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday She hides the bruises with linen and lace  The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask It's hard to see the pain behind the mask Bearing the burden of a secret storm Sometimes she wishes she was never born  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  Somebody cries in the middle of the night The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate When morning comes it'll be too late  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel

      I have just started listening to country music this last week at work, and have already found a couple songs I really like:   Andy Griggs - "She's More"   I like blue eyes, hers are green. Not like the woman of my dreams. And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned.  Five foot three isn't tall. She's not the girl I pictured at all. In those paint by number fantasies I've had,  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  No it wasn't, at first sight, But the moment I looked twice. I saw the woman I was born to love.  Her laughter fills my soul, And when I hold her I don't wanna let go. When it comes to her I can't get enough.  So it took me by complete surprise. When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  More than I dreamed of, More than any man deserves. I couldn't ask for more than a love like hers.  So it took me by complete surprise, When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes. She's not at all what I was looking for. She's more.  (hehe... Gwen has green eyes.)   Was That My Life?  - Jo Dee Messina   Ooooh.  I don't want to be the one who's old before their time, And lose the wonder that I felt as a child. I can't run this race believing I might lose; There's still so much to see, and so much left to do. Yes, I'll fall before I fly, But no one can say I never tried.  Oh, we just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   I close my eyes and think how lucky I have been, To hold the ones I love and share my dreams with them. All those sunny days and all those starry skies: Good morning kisses and sweet goodnights. Oh, I can't tell them enough, Just how much that they are loved.  Oh, you just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: was that my life?   We just get one ride around the sun, In this dream of time. It goes so fast that one day we look back, And we ask: oh, was that my life? Ooh, was that my life rollin' on by? Oooh, rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin' on by. Was that my life? Ooooh, was that my life?

      This is something really insightful that a member of  urlLink Youthfire.com , named  urlLink Dave  posted in  urlLink this page :  Love and relationships are truly one of the most paradoxical aspects of being human. For it is in love that we find the greatest of strengths and the deepest of sorrows. Love can seem to be so fleeting and unachievable yet it remains well within our reach if we only learn how to embrace it's power. To experience true love, we must be willing to open ourselves up and sacrifice part of our heart and part of our soul. We must be willing to give of ourselves freely, and we must be willing to suffer. It is only when we expose our inner selves to the white hot flame of rejection, that love can burn so brightly as to join to souls, melding the two into one, creating a bond that joins forever. It is from this bond that we draw strength eternal and power ever lasting. It is in this thing that we call love that we find the means to achieve greatness, both in ourselves and in our lives. ~Author Unknown  ...love is a serious thing. Don't take it for granted. It's not a toy, or a game, or something you just pick up in the street. It's a gift straight from God, treasure it.

      Ok, here I am... posting... at school... again... There's been so much happening over the last two weeks and I cannot really sum it all up any way except by writing it all out (a task that I'm working on at home... still a few more days until a couple of massive posts that will cover that.  Several major points off the top of my head:  1. My small group (plus Steven and Sash.) went on an all-nighter two Fridays ago and TPed Ryan and Drew's (two youth leaders) houses. 2. I drove Wednesday and Thursday with Mr Weber (my Bible and Driver's Ed. teacher). 3. I attended my high school's graduation and recorded it for Gwen 4. I went to a really weird Grad. Party for my friend Christine 5. I went to Song on the Mountains (a really cool romance / comedy play by  urlLink Stages Theater ) with Gwen, Goody and Cam. 6. I went to Brady's Grad. Party and got really wet in a water fight (twas fun). 7. I met the people that I'm going to be working for this summer (more like having fun with). 8. School's out at 12:00 tomorrow!!!

      You know,  urlLink BlogThis!  seems almost too easy to use... I mean it's just sitting there waiting to be clicked, and If you're already logged in... What if some younger sibling or any other similarly incompetent person was to by chance click on it? You never really know what could end up on your site.  Hmmm... randomness

      Man, my dad just doesn't get it... We were talking on the way to work today (my room wasn't clean last night, so he won't let me drive myself anywhere) about his relationship with mom and whether or not he's being loving.  It's so frustrating trying to reason with him. As most of you know, He's from a Moslem background (having been born in Iran and all...) and the way his culture has taught him to think from birth is much different than most of us. We all use "linear reasoning" meaning that when we see a problem, we actively work our way logically to a solution. Example: If we are being kept awake at night by a faucet dripping, we all eventually have to come to the conclusion that the faucet is at fault. Once we have done this, we actively work toward a solution: getting up and turning the faucet all the way off. The way my dad thinks though, is something called circular reasoning where you see a problem and instead of working toward a solution you keep turning around and focusing on the problem. Example: Again we have ourselves almost asleep, but being kept awake by a dripping faucet. Instead of thinking about why the faucets dripping though, we start obsessing about the problem (the faucets dripping, the faucets dripping, the faucets dripping, THE FAUCETS DRIPPING!!!). As you can see the former way of thinking is more logical, but once someones been ingrained with the latter, its very hard to convince them that they are going about it wrong, Imagine if you will that there is not one person, but two people within hearing of the faucet, one equipped with linear reasoning and one with circular, and that the one with linear (whom we will call person A) cannot reach the faucet.   Person B: The faucets dripping. Person A: I can hear the faucets dripping. Person B: The faucets dripping.  Person A: Yes, weve established that the faucets dripping, why dont you just go take care of it? Person B: Because the faucets dripping. Person A: What? How does the faucets dripping keep you from fixing the faucets dripping? Person B: Because the faucets dripping. Person A: WHAT?? Whats wrong with you? Person B: Nothing. Person A: THEN GO FIX THE FAUCET!! Person B: But, the faucets dripping.  This is pretty much how I feel when talking to my dad. He listens to what you say, but he doesnt  listen  to what you say. Actually, its more like he cant comprehend what youre saying.   Anyway, specifically we were talking about what he would do if she got kicked out of (or rather stopped attending because theres no way she feels comfortable there, and what good is a church if its not a place of refuge?) the church that they are both going to. He said that theres no way he would leave I really honed in on that the entire drive to work. He seems convinced that the husband is called to be a hedge of protection around the family only when everyones obeying him to the letter. (By hedge of protection, which is a biblical term, I mean guarding us all from people or things that might oppress us or bring us down  like the stupid people in my moms (now former) church. A small portion of our conversation went something like this:  Me: So youre saying you would stay at Southwest Hills if mom left or was kicked out? Him: Yes Me: Why? Him: Why not? Me: Well, think about it this way: youre always talking about unity and wanting to be one with you wife well what do you think itll do to her, knowing that you still continue going to a church where everyone looks down on her? Him: That is my church. Me: Yes, but your church as a whole seems to be at odds with mom.  silence Me: What are husbands supposed to do for their wives? Him: Love them and provide for them and Me: Whoa, wait a second; the first thing you said is love right? Him: yes Me: how are you displaying you love for her right now? Him: I love her. Me: Thats not what I asked, I asked how youre displaying it. Him: What do you mean? Me: Well, youre supposed to be a protection against things like this that are going on, but instead do you realize what youve become? - The very thing that God designed a husband to protect his wife against! Him: Well, shes the one thats leaving Me: What? And that somehow negates the husbands responsibility to be a shield? Youre to love and protect you family, especially your wife, unconditionally: not just when you think shes deserving of it. Him: But she has left me shield when she disobeyed me. Me: You just dont get it do you? She cant leave; its ALWAYS supposed to be there. Him: Not if she leaves it...  (This went on like this pretty much all the way to work.)  Maybe now you can kinda see the relation to the faucet example in his way of thinking.

      Ok, lets talk girls. (LOL) First off, obviously is Gwen. Im really confused as to my position right now regarding her  Steven, I told you that I was over her and I thought I was, but now I realize that Im not. I still very much in love with her, but Im praying that if its Gods will, that He help me let her go. Her position is just a friend but Im having a hard time adjusting to the idea (yeah, and since we were never technically a couple, that really *ahem* makes sense, yeah...). Though, I only think that way when I think about her by myself; when Im with her, Im fine just being friends. Its not like Im depressed or down over it or anything, Im just really confused with myself right now, thats all I guess.   Second girl, Bwitty; to begin with, dont get me wrong - Im not attracted to her like that, but for some reason I just realized after talking to her today for the first time in... several months (and she lives three blocks below me, how stupid is that?) that I really care about her. I dont get it, I can just see her hurting from a ton of stuff and I get almost... I want to say protective of her, but thats not the right word. Its like I want to just pull her away from all of it. (And the weirdest thing is, I dont really know her that well.) By the way Bwitty, if you read this, please know that Im praying for you.  Third girl, Laurie (and out of you three, youre the only one that actually reads this... if Im thinking right I should have talked about you first... hmm... and the fact that I just said that before posting it makes me question my sanity, but oh well) LOL Ne way, its kinda the same way with you as it is with Bwitty, though I actually know some of the stuff in Bwittys life, and I really dont know too much about you except from your blog and when we talk. Again, though, I find myself really caring about you (though not so much in a protective sense). I guess its more that I can relate to your situation and feel for anyone going through it cause I know what its like. Hey, I got your phone # btw, email me and tell me when a good time to call is. :)  Ok, the fact that I actually wrote that is starting to weird me out, so Im gonna go and get some... sleep... yeah... sleep sounds real good right now...

      I'm going to take my camera to youth group tonight and take some random pictures with the intention of posting them later tonight.   I need to get working on that  urlLink lyrics / mp3 page  later. In about a week, Im going to be completely revamping my computer network at home and hopefully setting up an apache web server to host my site locally. I may just put off working on anything until then, or I may not.... depends on whether I get bored I guess :)   Oh, I'm applying to join a youth newsletter that  urlLink Laurie's  starting. I may post my "trial" article when I finish it later today or tomorrow.

      This is so true:    It's summer, but what happened to the carefree ones that I'd come to love? They're gone forever...lost in the background as the scene shifts to focus on the culmination of our "childhood."  ~ urlLink Michael's Blog

      On Thursday, I talked to Drew for a while regarding issues between the Lees and Rivas. He advised me to stay neutral in the whole thing so that I could better benefit everyone. If I draw over to one side, what good am I doing?  On Friday, I got off work early before lunch, and drove Trung and Loren (coworkers) around town, from PCC Sylvania all the way over to Wilsonville, and back to several other places. We kept taking back roads at Trungs direction and getting lost :). After several hours of this, I finally dropped them off at Tonys house and went back to mine to get ready for the mini-concert at our church later. I dropped by Gwens work on the way over to church and finally saw her after she got back from the trip. She didnt want to take a break, so she walked me out to my car, carrying my only purchased item, a 2-liter of Ginger Ale (lol).   I finally got to church slightly past 4:30 and helped with setup. The concert officially started at 6:00, but we bumped it back an hour total, to accommodate setting the sound system up more precisely. It was really fun - Freeborn, my friend Jos band played. We had ramps and rails for boarding and bmx, plus a bbq and some other stuff. Katie, Kat, Melissa and Adri came. I stayed after until past 11:40, tearing down and putting stuff away.  On Sat., I went to Goodys house for Davids surprise B-day party. Later, Goody and I got a ride to the MAX station where we met Trung, Josh, Loren, Tony, Jason, and two other people and went to the Lloyd Center to see Pirates of the Caribbean. (Thats an AWESOME movie!!! Johnny Depps performance was perfect, and the movie as a whole couldnt have been done better. If you havent seen it yet, see it!). We saw some rather interesting people every time we got on / off the MAX: one kid was just being an idiot, cussing at everyone he saw, including old ladies and stuff. Everyone on the car started talking about him in hushed tones when he got off. Another guy is a mime that Ive seen down at Waterfront Park before  he paints his entire body, hair, face... clothes, silver and sits motionless for hours at a time. Then there were the two... dysfunctional women... who got into a fight on the tracks at the Lloyd Center Station and stopped a train. Then, they seemed content with hurling both insults and physical objects at each other from across the station until another train arrived, and one got on. Then, the other woman would occasionally get up and start screaming and beating at unseen people seemingly following her around. ...Interesting night.  Sunday morning, COUNTRY FEST 2003!!! (well, actually it wasnt that good) basically Trung, Loren, Josh, Jason and I drove for 2 hours out to St. Helens in two cars and spent the day tanning under the sun, listening to mind-numbingly loud country music. We were stationed more than 800 feet from the stage, and the bass woofers still shook the ground... Thats a little too much power, methinks. Later, it only took us an hour and a half to get home because we took the roads that we had completely overlooked on the way there. I was depressed the entire day after I got home. Everyone was cranky and needed a nap or something (lol).  Monday morning, work... I was still really depressed until mid afternoon, when Trung and I washed my bosss house for two hours (lol). For some reason, it was then that I regained my vitality and joyful spirit and all. Later that evening, my parents attended a church-wide meeting at their church that would be the springboard for the church to vote whether of not to kick my mom out (In my very wise uncles words: I was at the stupid meeting last night. Wished I could have been somewhere else, but Im glad I was there to support your mom. Those people there are... CRAZY, for lack of a more demeaning term.)  Today, I got to work late since my room wasnt clean, and my parents new punishment to obsess with is not letting me drive anywhere. They are going to start using that as recklessly as they confiscated my Xbox back in Feb. They kept adding on and on time till I could have it back, until as of now, I am entitled to have it back sometime next Spring (though I just decided to go and take it out of their room two weeks ago, and either they havent noticed it yet, or theyre trying to act like they dont care.  My mom and I went out to lunch today (she picked me up from work), and we had a long talk about every topic ranging from Gwen, to work, to school next year, to the meeting last night at her church. I love my mom; shes so easy to talk to. :)  Today, I went up to Gwens house at about 8:15pm and didnt get back down until almost 10:20. While I was up there she made some random comment about how long my hair was, and within ten minutes she was giving me a haircut (lol). I need to take a picture of myself now, Im all buzzed. My foot's sore from kicking her punching bag for like, 20 minutes.   Tomorrow, Im letting Trung borrow my Xbox and Im borrowing his PS2 for ...a week I think.  Well, goodnight everyone, and may God watch over your sleep.

      Hey everyone, sup? I dunno what was wrong with me the last couple days... I was so unfailingly joyful for a couple weeks then I sunk into a huge depression. But now, through my own realization that God is in control of my life, coupled with the support of friends, I'm fine again.   This is a poem that  urlLink Laurie  wrote and emailed to me yesterday after reading my Mon Jul 21, 11:40:00 AM post. Thanks, Laurie, that meant alot to me:   I bled for you    Everything is fading away Everything but my pain There's nothing left in me I think I'm going insane  Truth or lie I feel like I'm falling away I'd rather die Than feel this way  Where is the love you promised Where is the peace you share Where is the golden rainbow Or do you even care?  My eyes are hollow holes I'm drowning in my hurt I reach out, reach up I'm falling to the dirt  There's a cavity inside me I'm falling down into the pit It has no bottom, I'm forever falling Something doused the candle that was lit  I'm falling, falling Falling away from you Something's pulling me down Holding onto me like glue  Tears keep falling down my face I am powerless to stop them This is my only release Until I hit rock bottom  I want to die Why am I alive The question echoes through me Cutting through me like a knife  I look at my heart Bloody, stained, broken Then my heart echoes With words softly spoken  "Did you know I bled for you?" The thought pierces my soul My God, my God, have you forsaken me? "No, my heart is full."  "I bled too, my son I know how you feel" You couldn't! I yell "But I have, it is the seal."  "My heart bleeds even now At your pain that seems so endless" Tears flow faster down my cheeks, At the memories of bliss  "Cry my son, Cry for the love Cry for the loss Cry for the blood."     Laurie, 2003

      I just wrote this ten minutes ago.   The End    My life, my comfort, my shell of hope, Creaked and groaned with every passing day But now its all finally come crashing down God help me,  I never thought it would end this way.  Alone in the darkness The dawn brings not hope, But despair and distress Challenge me to cope.  Im left in the ruins  Of all I can see Fathomless grief  Consuming me.  No one to run to,  Nowhere to hide, Nothing to live for,  No path by which to bide.  The fire which once Gave light to my heart Burns down to nothing; Shadow, Light depart.  As I wander this wasteland Over and over, Again and again, Memories of every kind Flood past me,  Thoughts of what could have been  Of what could have been.

        Drive - Incubus   Sometimes, I feel the fear of  Uncertainty stinging clear. And I cant help but ask myself How much Ill let the fear  Take the wheel and steer.  Its driven me before, and it seems to Have a vague, haunting mass appeal. But lately I am beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel.  Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there, Ill be there  So if I decide to waiver my chance to be one of The hive Will I choose water over wine and hold my own And drive?  Its driven me before and it seems to be the way That everyone else gets around. But lately Im beginning to find that When I drive myself My light is found.  Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there, Ill be there  (Would you kill the Queen to crush the hive?)  Would you choose Water over wine Hold the wheel And drive?  Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there With open arms and open eyes, yeah. Whatever tomorrow brings, Ill be there, Ill be there   That's all I can think of tonight folks... I'm way too burned out... I want to crawl into a dark hole and sleep for a week. Or maybe die, that sounds better. Hmm... scratch that... Dying in and of itself seems rather pointless, but the property of being dead... Oh God I wish I could just be gone from here.

      Oh man, I could listen to this song for an eternity... I love it, it's so beautiful.    Nina Gordon - Tonight and the rest of my life   Down to the earth I fell with dripping wings Heavy things wont fly And the sky might catch on fire And burn the axis of the world thats why I prefer a sunless sky To the glittering and stinging in my eyes  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life  Gleaming in the dark sea Im as light as air floating there breathlessly When the dream dissolves I open up my eyes I realize that Everything is shoreless sea A weightlessness is passing over me  And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life And I  Everything is waves and stars The universe is resting in my arms  I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life And I feel so light This is all i want to feel tonight And I feel so light Tonight and the rest of my life Tonight and the rest of my life   I'm going to sleep to this song tonight. :)

      My current favorite song:    JoDee Messina - I Wish   It's not easy saying this to you It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do But boy before you go I want you to know  I wish you strength When times are hard Oh I wish with all my heart you find what  you're looking for I wish you joy I wish you peace And that every star you see's within your reach And I wish you still loved me  I wish that things were different you know that But still I'm happy for the time we had You mean the world to me Baby please believe  I wish you strength When times are hard Oh I wish with all my heart you find what  you're looking for I wish you joy I wish you peace And that every star you see's within your reach And I wish you still loved me  Losing you is tearing me apart But a part of me will be with you no matter where you are  I wish you strength When times are hard Oh I wish with all my heart you find what  you're looking for I wish you joy I wish you peace And that every star you see's within your reach And I wish you still loved me  Oh, I wish you still loved me   Oh, btw, I got a car on Sunday!! I don't know why I didn't post about that before now... maybe I've been slightly preoccupied (lol)

      This post kinda incorporates a response to  urlLink Kevins  comment about my last post, in it.    that's too bad Armaan. at least you get to be friends. I have a friend that this (very similar) thing happened to recently. He was/is crushed. It's a bad thing that happens between people. I urge you to keep praying about it if you still have feelings for her. This may be God's way of preparing her for a good relationship with you? Who among us knows the mind of God? Anyway, my point is she can still change her mind in the future. ~Kevin    The sad thing is, I was planning to tell her everything about how I feel and how much she means to me the next time I talked to her, but now Im glad I didnt. I cant imagine how hard it would have been for her to tell me that if I had started out by telling her how I felt about her. She has a hard enough time as it is just telling me stuff that could potentially hurt me to begin with. (Shes such a sweet girl... she really doesnt want to hurt me, but at the same time, she doesnt want to lead me on. I really respect her for that.)  Anyway, yeah, I really dont want to loose her as a friend. I guess that I would venture to say that keeping a good friendship with her is more important than any type of romantic relationship, if it has the possibility of leaving us farther apart than when we started. Plus, the only way Ill be happy with the situation is if shes happy: We could be dating steadily, but if shes not happy, Im not happy. Same goes with another guy: If shes in a relationship with someone else, and isnt happy, Im not going to be happy, but if she is, then I most likely will be (or at least will try to be).  As far as where this relationship is going... Your guess is as good as mine (lol). I think Ill just have to sit back and trust God on that one. (Hey, what am I saying? I have to trust him for the entire thing.) Through all this though, my love for her is not even flickering... I pray that if its not Gods will that we never get back together, that He would take my love for her from me, but if we ever will, I pray that I never get involved with another girl between now and then... I want to be there for her if shes ever in a time of need.  Oh, btw, Im meeting Drew tomorrow to talk and pray about the... issue surrounding two families that I love, and want to have good relations restored between.

      Gwen called! (lol - ok... enough) She's back and had a great time. We talked for around an hour and ten minutes starting at 12:20 (late... yeah, but that is our custom).   You know, I was secretly afraid this was going to happen the entire time, but I guess I pretty well convinced myself that it wasn't, because if I'd thought about it for long enough, I would have been insanely depressed... and now that it actually has happened... exactly as I feared it would but never thought it would, I think I can handle it.  Well, maybe...  Hmm...  Only time will tell...   What on earth am I talking about you ask? Well, in the course of our conversation tonight (this morning - lol) Gwen told me that she had something that she wanted to talk to me about (Im thinking *oh no, here it comes*). She said she had been doing a lot of thinking about it over the three weeks she was away, and had decided that it would probably be better if we just remained friends... never to become anything greater. She went on to say that (*yup, I guessed it alright*) she had found someone that she was more interested in while on the trip. (Story of my life.) Immediately afterward though, she added that she wanted to continue being friends, and I heartily agreed.  After that our normal conversation resumed and we talked for another 45 minutes until her mom made us (well, me since she knows I have work early in the morning, and Gwen doesn't) get off.  o.O I just remembered that email I sent, that I know for certain she hasn't read yet... Hmmm... I wonder what effect that'll have...  Well, good night and happy landings and don't forget to check out the newest of my friend's blogs...  urlLink Andrew's

        the Ataris - In This Diary   Here in this diary, I write you visions of my summer. It was the best I ever had. There were choruses and sing-alongs, and not a spoken feeling. I'm knowing that right now is all that matters. All the nights we stayed up talking and listening to 80's songs; quoting lines from all those movies that we love. It still brings a smile to my face. I guess when it comes down to it...  Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart and eventually you'll finally get it right.  Breaking into hotel swimming pools, and wreaking havoc on our world. Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time. The black top's singing me to sleep. Lighting fireworks in parking lots, illuminate the blackest nights. Cherry cokes under this moonlight summer sky. 2015 Riverside, it's time to say, "goodbye." Get on the bus, it's time to go.  Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up: These are the best days of our lives. The only thing that matters is just following your heart, and eventually you'll finally get it right.

      Cameran wanted me to post this email, so I'm doing so;  Subject: Or you can put this on my blog   Hey Armaan, I have been thinking about all that has been going on non-stop.  and how tired I'm.   I have been weighing out everything, and what is good for me.  I also have been talking to my Mom about it all.  And here is my opinion, because I'm done with all this crap.  ---------------------------------------------------- I know if Brady really wanted to he could turn around. Brady Can't be helped, I wanted to help him, because he is a great guy.  the reason he can't be helped is because he won't help himself. why you ask? because He loves attention, that's why he continues to be in areas or subjects having to do with the rivas family or anything that gives attention to him.  And I'm sure that's not the only problem. ---------------------------------------------------- I'm not saying I'm perfect we all have problems,insecurities, and issues, I guess just one of mine is low tolerance.    My only friends that have helped me grow mentally are you armaan and andrew motimer.  ---------------------------------------------------- And the Rivas family in my opinion, not having to do with Brady or beth...just my own experience, are the type of people I hope to never be like.    They have everything wrong about me, even how they think they know me, If they really knew me they would hate me like they hate Brady, I'm sure. I'm also "VERY" tired of being bossed around by people who think they are better in every way, when they really aren't, because no man is above another we are all equally guilty.  and when you don't do as they say some tend to get physical or argue aloud. And I don't want to be around that anymore. I really have nothing good to say about the Rivas family,  and just one of the reasons I can't be a friend to the Rivas family is because in there minds they are perfect, and there is no helping the perfect. so I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- And going to Drew could help you, but most likely won't, and you know what? I hope I'm completely wrong about every single thing I have said so far and that I will say.     ----------------------------------------------------   I'm cutting myself off from this whole mess. I have a new screen name. I will no longer be answering the phone for these numbers/people and not because I hate the people I just hate the way, and well the retardedness at times.      [at this point he lists all phone numbers associated with the Lee and Rivas families]     Family's: Rivas Lee         And I have blocked certain e-mail addresses. I wonder if this is what you might call a mental break down of some kind. O and tell the rivas family not to bother coming to my house, because like I have said I'm done. ---------------------------------------------------- Here is some advise to the rivas family in the matter of Brady and ect:    This is love: To love people as we find them, and if they have weaknesses, to accept them with a heart filled with love.   "Love never fails." 1 Cor. 13:8   A friend is someone that will except you the way he or she found you, And if she or he has weaknesses, to accept him or her with a heart filled with love and to help them no matter the matter because that is just one of the many things friend are for.   1 Corinthians 13:1-13  I may speak in the tongues of men, even angels; but if I lack love, I have become merely blaring brass or a cymbal clanging.  I may have the gift of prophecy, I may fathom all mysteries, know all things, have all faith-enough to move mountains; but if I lack love, I am nothing.  I may give away everything that I own, I may even hand over my body to be burned; but if I lack love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient and kind, not jealous, not boastful, not proud, rude or selfish, not easily angered, and it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not gloat over other peoples sins  But takes its delight in the truth. Love always bears up, always trusts, always hopes, always endures.  Love never ends; but prophecies will pass, tongues will cease, knowledge will pass. For our knowledge is partial, and our prophecy partial; but when the perfect comes, he partial will pass.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, argued like a child; now that I have become a man, I have finished with childish ways.   For now we see obscurely in a mirror, but then it will be face to face. Now I know partly; then I will know fully, just as God has fully known me.  But for now, three things last- Trust, Hope, Love; And the greatest of these is Love.   -----------------------------------------------------    Our "group"  (circle of friendship)  is a place of warmth and caring  (but for me its been cold because of serious competition in the area of play or "games", and caring which is fake if acted out)  Where people come together  (now there is a rift in-between the Lee family and the Rivas family which complicates and complicates over and over.)  for listening and sharing. ( which can be hard at times because of the rift but other wise is easy for me and you) A place of kindness and trust. ( it used to be, and if there still is its decaying) of tears and laughter too; ( tears of joy? I don't think so at the moment, laughter seems a bit scares but I could be wrong.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Armaan, I know I suck as a friend too. I'm very sorry about everything. if you could you might want to put this on your blog. but you might wanna edit out the phone #. I'm sure I'll talk to you soon, but I will see you later dude.   Sincerely,  Cameran Renata Heckenlaible      p.s. I'm done  .....Hiding in my hole, like andrew.

      Ok, yesterday morning I got up at 5:15 (not 4:00 like Id planned) and ran to finish packing before 6:00 when Laurie would get to my house... Im glad I did rush since, even with her dad getting lost for 15 minutes, (lol) I was still a little late getting out to the car.   Once I finally got out, my mom drove us an hour-an-a-half down to OSU (Oregon State) in Corvallis. We were they that day and today for the Mid-Summer Conference - part of our apprenticeships through ASE (Apprenticeships in Science and Engineering), and division of Saturday Academy. We got down there, signed in, ate a continental breakfast and hung out for a while, all before the orientation session at 9 oclock. After that, all 150 of us apprentices there split up into groups of about 15 and played some really random get-to-know-you games together for a while. Then, we had the first of several lectures that day (we picked the ones we wanted to attend beforehand), ate lunch, and had a couple more lectures and a hands-on workshop. Dinner was fun - the caf that we ate in was sweet.   After dinner, we split up into 20 groups at the MU Quad and set about defying gravity by building 2 meter tall towers out of nothing but newspaper, a tiny bit of tape and a predetermined random object. The tower had to support itself in the wind, suspending a marble from it, for a minimum of ten seconds. Awards were given to the two teams who built the most complex tower, and the cheapest tower. My group won the first title and Lauries won the second (lol)  Later that night, my little group of friends (Laurie, and some random people we had just met from Lakeview  Wade and Kate, and other people) went swimming. The pools at OSU are sweet. :)  They consisted of a huge diving pool, Olympic-size relay pool and a mammoth hot tub. Twas quite fun. After I got out, I spent like ten minutes in a frikin hot sauna drying off. As we were walking back, Wade and some random girl decided to run through some random sprinklers for a while, and while they were doing so, others informed me about some really funny senior pranks they pull at their school. (This was almost 9:45 at night, and it had finally cooled down from 85 to around 75.)   Once I got back to the dorm, I changed and walked back down to the MU (the under-story of which is a pool hall / bowling alley / mini theater place. I left shortly thereafter, because of the heat. (I met Laurie walking back from it as I walked to it and she warned me that it was hot in there, but did I listen? ... no  lol) Later, close to 10:45 or 11:00 I grabbed a couple pop tarts and watched part of Monty Python and the Holy Grail before getting back up to my room. My roommates and I didnt get to sleep for what must have been a couple hours, partly because of the heat, and partly because of random logic and word problems we kept giving each other... like: whats the only word in the English language whos pronunciation and meaning are both changed by capitalizing the first letter? polish >> Polish (interesting, huh?).  Ne way, I got up this morning around 7:00 instead of 6:00 and decided to forgo a shower for the day. I packed all my luggage and turned in my room key (but not my food card, which I needed for dinner the night before and breakfast later that morning). I had cereal for breakfast...yum.   Right after breakfast, we took group pictures on the steps of the MU (We were commenting that we all felt like a combination of a junior MENSA, FFA and some major communist party, 150 of us intellectual teenagers, walking down the streets of a major college, all wearing the same light blue shirt. We took several pictures, and I realized later that photographer in front of us didnt have the only camera trained on us: Theres a live webcam on the building the Quad from us that was recording a time-lapse video that I dled, and am working on extracting an image from. Once I do so, Ill post it.   The next lecture was the only one Laurie and I had in common. Sooo... um... *how to say?* boring. The next one for me was worse, actually, but the last hands-on one was SO fun. It was so random; was on automatic data storage and collection. At one point, one of the students needed a hand-held barcode scanner, across the room, so an instructor picked one up and threw it to him. I though that was strange and asked him, Umm... how much are those worth? He replied calmly Oh, about 55 hundred a piece. Later, when I asked him why he was just throwing 5 grand pieces of equipment around haphazardly, he responded by picking up another one, and throwing across the room. Turns out the scanners are the best on the market... insured for up to a 12 foot drop onto concrete (lol).  We had lunch on the Quad (like the yesterday) and I called Bwitty, and actually got a hold of her for the first time in months! (An accomplishment, I feel.) Laurie ended up talking to her for like, twenty times longer than I did.   Anyway, later there was a final meeting, during which my mom showed up and told me to step outside quickly and call my dad since he was putting a down payment on what was going to be my new car. *yay* Later, we drove back home, Laurie got picked up at my house, and I drove the van for the first time, by myself, to the theater to see LXG (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  Man, I spent so much time with Laurie over the last two days. Every break, every meal, we were together, talking or something. Shes a cool girl and Id never really gotten to know her that well. Altogether, the Conference was an awesome time.

      Today was fun. Two things of interest happened:  (In order of priority) 1. Gwen called again!  2. I got my drivers license!  I got up late, and found the address for the DMV on the way there... (lol), waited in lines for a while and finally got assigned an examiner. You know how they always tell you not to engage in small talk with the examiner while taking the test... itll only distract you? Apparently they werent thinking of me and my instructor. We were chatting the entire time... Topics ranged from to the weather, our jobs, buildings being demolished on the side of the road, and even random rodents running across the road at odd times (in the middle of a city...). LOL. After that I went back inside, waited in more lines and finally took the test on the computer, got my picture taken and received my license.   I drove back home, got stuff for work and headed over to work, arriving at 11:15 (I usually get there at 8:00). I worked for an hour, talked on the phone with Gwens mom for another hour while programming PIC chips and starting my lunch break (lol), took another half hour for the rest of my lunch break, and got back to work. Stuff was going smoothly until a technical rescue vehicle, followed by an ambulance pulled into view. (As my other posts say, it turned out that my bosss wife has a major insulin reaction. He blood sugar level was 239ish around lunch, and dropped to 29 in three hours. Anyway, they gave her an IV and she was fully conscious within a few minutes.  I got off work at 5:00, went home, chatted on IRC chat.christianlinks.com #youthfire for an hour or so, ate dinner, and headed over to Mid-Week. (I was going to drive over to Cams house, but I thought Steven might need a ride back from Mid-Week, so I had my dad take me there and back  I cant drive anyone under 20, outside of my family for 6 months, with Oregon driving rules). The funny thing is, Steven and I didnt even end up seeing each other and didnt know the other was even there until we talked about it later on the same chat room listed above.  Then, at 9:22, Gwen called! (lol) I was beginning to suspect Id have to wait for her to get back to talk to her next, but no, she was sweet and called again :)  My dad and I ate at Carls Jr., and he told me about a walk hed had with my mom earlier. Thats cool  twas the first time theyve done that in... a long while.  Oh, btw, Im gonna have to leave youth group really early tomorrow night, since I have to get up at 4 the nest morning. (Loris coming over at 6, and we need to be checked into the ASE Mid-Summer Conference by 8:30 in Corvallis). My moms prolly going to end up spending the night down there, since its easier to do that than to some back up then go back down and back up again on Sat.   Well, see yah all on the flipside (and I fear for  urlLink Ddee  and her platinum hair.... *shudders* - lol)

      o.O Uh oh, an ambulance just drove up... I'd better go check and see what's going on...  ***half-an-hour later***  Ok, it was just my boss's wife having an insulen reaction ("just"... yeah i know). She doesn't remember calling 911. Strange...

      ok, I emailed Gwen last night, but forgot to post the email before I got off, so here you go:    Subject: Thinking about you...  Hey Gwen, howre you doing? I know that youll not be reading this until after you get back (possibly way after, knowing your email checking habits - lol) but Ill write it like I am writing to you right now, not you a week from now.   ...If you understood that, Ill be happy cause I barely do reading through it again, tired as I am.   Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I miss you and Im praying for you. A couple days after I got that letter asking for prayer for the trip, I tacked it up on my wall to remind me to do just that. Initially, it helped a lot, Id see it as I was going to bed, and pray for you for a while every night. Even several weeks before you left, it got so ingrained in my mind, that I was praying for the trip more than a couple times a day. (In fact, I dont know really why I still have the letter up maybe just sentimental reasons). Now, youre one of the biggest things on my mind, day by day. I almost laughed when you asked me to be praying for everyones health to stay strong, in spite of lack of sleep, when you called last Tuesday. That was one of the major things God had pressed upon my heart since the day I found out you were going on the trip. Oh, and its not just me several of my friends around the world are praying for the trip (and specifically you) too. They know nothing really about you other than youre a friend of mine thats going on a mission trip for around three weeks, and that I knew that youd be appreciative if they were praying for it and for you.   On a slightly more personal note: I really do miss you. Im gonna be so happy when I see your pretty face again, or even hear your voice. :)  (Do me a favor: dont go somewhere far away for college right after you graduate. Thats really going to get to me, having to spend my senior year not really seeing you at all. Hmm I guess Ill just have to trust God about that one. Oh, by the way, speaking of God, I have to praise Him: all this week, more and more stuff has been happening to my family, but through it all, Ive been amazingly happy. I just cant get over this joyful spirit, and I thank the Lord for it (and I thank you for caring enough to tell me out right to stay happy last time we talked).    Oh well, my contacts are starting to annoy my eyes and I have to get up  an hour early tomorrow for work, so Id better wrap this up and send it.   With love, in Christ,   ~Armaan

      Ok, this post is a reply to Steven's latest post on  urlLink his blog . In fact, I would be writing this in his comments section, but it's just way too long.  The following is part of his 7/8/2003 01:51:36 PM post:    Why the heck did God give me the life he did? Why couldn't I have the life of so many other people... they are happy. Why was I given this life to live? I'm supposed to learn from it? I'd rather not; I'd rather that I had a life like other people. Mine is freaking messed up.    Yeah, I kinda know how you're feeling right now (kinda cause my situation at home is slightly different from yours... but not by much). I've been going through this whole emotional Ferris wheel too. One minute, things will be fine with my dad, then the next it's a hurricane. I think so often, "God, why oh why did I even have to be born to live this life? Why did you pick me? Is there something I'm supposed to get out of it; is there something you're preparing me for? I don't want to go through this to become closer to You, I want to be close NOW, Lord... Why couldn't you have picked someone else to live through this hell, someone better suited for it? I just want to get out... want to get out.... want. to. get. out.  Steven, like you, right now I can't really offer many answers, only more questions. But one thing I do know (though I think many times that I'm mistaken, but always realize I was right after all, after a time): No matter how hard it is to see it now (and in some cases, even impossible), God does have a plan for our lives; He loves us and knows what's best for us. Though oh, so many times I wish God would just take me from this earth, or better yet, cause me to never have been born. All this having been said, I'm forced to wonder why he picked me (why he picked us). If God had not been with us all this time, helping us through it, I truly believe we would have cracked far before now.   Whatever... if I say anything else, it'll just be rambling on and on about what I just said, so I'll leave it at that.

      I just got back from my Goody, David and Sara's house, where we had a short HALO LAN party. In attendance were Goody, David, Cam, Caleb, Dallas, Ryan, Ben, Sara and me. I brought a large tv and my XBOX.  We (Goody, David, Cam and me) creamed everyone else royally. 'Twas fun. :)  Earlier this morning, I went to my orthodontist to get a permanent retainer re-bonded. Took like, 5 minutes, but I missed the first hour-and-a-half of work for it. Oh well, I'll just come in a half-hour early, tomorrow through Thursday.  Steven and I were going to go to a youth counseling thing tomorrow night called Teens Helping Teens, but my mom was at the facility today and found out that they had a recent schedule change - same time, but Mondays, not Tuesdays. I hope well both be able to make it to it now that its a different day.  Ok, I just cant post this without mentioning Gwen. (lol) Im really starting to miss her now, and its only been like 10 days. I cant imagine what its going to be like if she goes far off someplace to college for a year while Im still a senior in high school. Hmm thinking about that just depresses me, so instead Ill think about seeing her again when she gets back. I might write her an email or two for her to read when she gets back, but I know she never checks her email... so it might be pointless. Nah, I'll do it anyway.  Listening to  John Tesh -  Goodnight Moon .   Close your eyes and drift away... Touch the stars in the sky on the way...   (the singer sings the rest so softly that it's hard to pick out some of her words, so I'll juss leave it at that.  Goodnight world. Sleep well. (Be safe, those of you north of the border... come home soon.)

      People that need prayer:  1. Gwen (man, I miss her) > For her mission trip, that everything will continue to go well, that people will continue to function with lack of sleep and that they would all be protected from any diseases that might be going around (and bugs and stuff). 2. My mom > She's been under constant emotional attack lately, not only from my dad and sister, but also from the majority of her church, who have sided with my dad. 2. My sister > She's kinda heading down the wrong path, siding with my dad in all the new issues. She's becoming harder and harder to live with and I want that to change. 3. Bwitty > She's going through a tough time in her life right now. I don't really know any details, if you read  urlLink her blog , you'll be about as informed as I. 4. Josiah, Jesh and Jalon's family. > Apparently they just lost a grandpa. 5. People like me, Steven and Laurie (a friend from  urlLink YouthFire.com  - check out  urlLink her blog ), who live in situations involving an abusive, or at least, over domineering parent.  Goodnight fellow firework-toting patriots and others, alike. Go with God.

      [Music Mood]: A Few Questions - Clay Walker  We got the organ today :) It's tight. My dad wants to keep it in the garage untill we get it cleaned up, but then I hope to move it to the main area in the basement. (There's a slight possibility that it won't fit into the basement door, so we may have to put it on the main floor.) :D  btw, I posted a new song to my blog last post, but forgot to post the lyics *gasp* Soooo, here they are:   Lifehouse - Hanging by a Moment   Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  Forgetting all I'm lacking Completely and complete I'll take your invitation You take all of me  Now, I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  There's nothing left to lose Nothing left to fly There is nothing in the world that can change my mind There is nothing else There is nothing else  Desperate for changing Starving for truth Closer where I started Chasing after you  I'm falling even more in love with you Letting go of all I've held onto I'm standing here until you make me move I'm hanging by a moment here with you  I'm living for the only thing I know I'm running and not quite sure where to go I don't know what I'm diving into Just hanging by a moment here with you  Just hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment Hanging by a moment here with you

      [Music Mood]: Lifehouse  Hanging by a Moment  Gwen called again today! :) I was so happy so hear her voice again (lol).   I'm constructing some massive fireworks (some for the 4th, some for... other purposes). Were prolly going to the Jeshs house on the fourth and I might light some off there.   Tomorrow were getting an electric organ. :) For free :)  Thursday night, Adrie, Melissa, Rachael and Josh are all coming to my youth group for a welcome home thingy for the newly-arrived-back Mexico team. Should be fun.

      My new fav. country song:    Lonestar -  My Front Porch Looking In   Oh yeah Yeah oh yeah  The only ground I ever owned was sticking to my shoes Now I look at my front porch and this panoramic view I can sit and watch the fields fill up With rays of glowing sun Or watch the moon lay on the fences Like that's where it was hung My blessings are in front of me It's not about the land I'll never beat the view From my front porch looking in  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them And the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in, yeah  I've traveled here and everywhere Following my job I've seen the paintings from the air Brushed by the hand of God The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea But I can't wait to get back home To the one he made for me It's anywhere I'll ever go and everywhere I've been Nothing takes my breath away Like my front porch looking in  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them Yeah the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in  I see what beautiful is about When I'm looking in  Not when I'm looking out  There's a carrot top who can barely walk With a sippy cup of milk A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong 'Cause she likes to dress herself And the most beautiful girl holding both of them Yeah the view I love the most  Oh, the view I love the most Is my front porch looking in Yeah Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk (From my front porch looking in) A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah And the most beautiful girl (Beautiful girl From my front porch looking in) Holding both of them Oh, yeah

      Anyway, recap: my dad was being an idiot and harrassing my mom for a while on the 1st floor, but i had no idea since I was up here in my room (3rd floor), online. My grandma called me and told me that she was on another phone with my mom, who was on another phone with the police. I had my sister (the younger one) lock herself in her room since I didn't know really what was going on, or how serious it was, and went downstairs to the room my mom was currently in. She was visibly shaken and I could tell my dad had really scared her. We waited a few minutes for the police to arrive and my dad, naturally came down and accosted the door of the room we were in for a bit before going up to the front door and answering it. Once we heard the front door open, my mom was fine with going up, so we did and then I went back up to my room for a bit while the police talked to my parents alone and kinda calmed the situation down. Later, my dad wanted to talk to me about why he had walked out on my presentation yesterday, but only succeded in making me all the more angry with him. He can be such a jerk when he wants to be... And we're all going to have to spend the next week with him up in Canada... joy...  Anyway, situation's passed, standby for more outbreaks of rage...

Sorry for the confusion if anyone saw that ...  btw, this was at about 9:00 here:  Hey, can everyone be praying for my family? We're in the middle of something kinda big right now involving my dad and we've got police over.  Thanks,  ~Armaan

           find out more at  urlLink jimmyeat.meetup.com    That's an awesome idea. :) I'm actually considering going to that.  Ddee, Andrew, Cam, Steven... wanna come with? (lol) I really don't have any idea if i'm even doing anything that day yet or not. ;)  This is an amazing J.E.W. song: it's written to Jimmy's girlfriend who died in a tragic car accident way before J.E.W. ever became a band. (At least that's the more popular of the two stories of how the song same to be, and it makes sense.)    Jimmy Eat World - Hear You Me     There's no one in town I know. You gave us some place to go. I never said thank you for that. I thought I might have one more chance. What would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that, Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead yo in.  So what would you think of me now... So lucky, So strong, So proud? I never said thank you for that. Now I'll never have a chance.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleeplss go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.  And if you were with me tonight. I'd sing to you just one more time. A song for a heart so big, God couldn't let it live.  May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in. Hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads, The sleepless go. May angels lead you in. May angels lead you in.    One of the many thing that's awesome about this band is their dedication to their fans and to their music, not to the money - This is an actual Q&A I got from  urlLink http://www.jimmyeatworld.net/history/faq.html , a division of the official site.   Q.  How does the band feel about mp3s / bootlegs / napster / ebay / file sharing?   A.  I can't give an actual quote from the band, but I will tell you this. The band gave away all their songs for free on their website before Self-Titled (Bleed American) was even released (and they are still there!) . The band seems to not have a problem with sites that offer live mp3s to fans for free. On the other hand, the band said they hate when people sell their stuff on ebay. So I guess you could say that the band is cool if you are trading stuff between music fans, but they do not want you selling anything. Hopefully people can be trusted to purchase the CDs that contain the songs they download, if they are available.   Goodnight my beloveds, may God watch over your sleep, and when you're awake, may God direct your life.

      Ok, important things first: (lol) I had a great conversation with Gwen on Sunday night. I had called her house a couple times before 10:00 or so, but it was busy so I got online and she got on around 11:30. I asked if she would mind calling me when she got off, and she did later. We talked for a total of almost an hour (she called twice) and in that time I basically explained to her how I'd been feeling all this time and everything (mainly that I am in love with her) and that seemed to take her by shock. As far as calling her, she doesn't want me to stop, but maybe do it slightly less frequently. Oh, btw, I did inform her that I was perfectly content with being 'just friends' and she seemed relieved by that. I want her to be happy, and she is, so I am too. :)  The same night my friend Danie (short for Danielle, not Daniel) introduced me to a couple of her friends named Becky and Mandy. (... well more like they started talking under the false pretence of being her - lol). That Beckys the one that confused SSs Becky with her comment on the message board (lol).  I'm under some level of stress concerning a huge presentation I have to have to give on Sat. for my apprenticeship. Please be parying that I'll get everything done well and on time. Oh, btw, I very much doubt that I'll be online much, much less blog between now and then. And... I'm gonna be gone all of next week, so don't expect to see me online for a while. Ddee, I will be back before the 30th, but most likely I'm already attending a key signing party at Mikminamen's on the waterfront. Linus Torvald (however you spell his last name) might be there! I'm excited. :) :)

      Ok, heres the post about Sat. that I told people, on Sat. that Id be posting, but procrastinated  as is my nature. (lol)  I woke up at 10:15 from a phone call from Andrew who had just woken up too. (We were both planning on getting up somewhere in the area of 9, and we did, but we both went back to sleep again - LOL). I got ready as quickly as possible, but right as I was heading out the door, I was stopped by my dad who declared that I wasnt going anywhere until I cleaned my room, vacuumed the house and washed the dishes. I weaseled my way out of that, but it still seemed to set me back about half an hour more Andrew just eventually met me at a McDonalds by his house. We at brunch there and headed off to the mall (illegally, yes in Oregon you have to have your license for 6 months before you can even drive one person under 20, outside of your family.  dumb law, I think, but I guess there are enough stupid kids my age here to warrant passing more laws to restrict them.)    urlLink   Andrew at McDonalds.    Once we got to the mall, we met up with Ddee and Kristy and headed over to the bus stop. Little did we know that would be the start of the first many, many loooooong waits at bus stops all day (but its all good, thats when we would talk the most  waiting for busses)    urlLink   Ddee and Kristy waiting for us at the mall      urlLink   part of a wall of mirrors that always reflect straight back at you  I was a ditz and used the flash.      Once the bus finally got there (like  an hour later), we rode it to a transit center in downtown Portland, but before we got off, we met an interesting couple that seemed rather... high. We (the four of us) had been talking about fire and explosives, specifically my friend and his dad blowing up a microwave in some random field on part of their property. These two college students who had just boarded the buss set about trying to convince us not to become Unabombers, but if we were going to, to become artistic Unabombers. The guy started going off on how the world needed more art and culture and less hate, while then girl started letting phrases she must have heard from a stoned professor somewhere fall out of her mouth like, positive aura less negativity means a better life and peace not war, love not hate. She was doing this is perfect combination with the rather elaborate movements her arms kept making at random intervals. HAHAHA We all burst out laughing for a full 30 seconds or so, as we drove away from the stop at which they had exited.  After waiting for another ten or so minutes downtown, we boarded another bus which took us to the Oregon City Transit Center. In this bus we met another quirky, if not quite so amusing fellow who seemed to take a little too fond a liking to Ddee and Kristy. O, btw, he was drunk too. We were sitting at a right angle along the side and back of the bus, with Andrew one seat ahead of the guy, Ddee and Kristy two seats behind him and me two seats to their left. I was seriously thinking about just getting up and sitting between the guy and them since he was seriously making me nervous, but Andrew beat me to it by moving our stuff out of that seat and sitting between them and me. The guy procceded to give us a rather lengthy life story about how he was too rich and too smart to work, and how he grew the best pot in the state, right in his own backyard. I think we got him to think he wanted to get off at a sooner stop than he would have by how many times we asked him which stop was his, but who knows maybe he did live there?  Once we got to the Oregon City Transit Center, we waited for another half hour or more for the next and final bus to arrive that would take us to what we have now dubbed as the POC (Piece Of Crap) Fair.  While we were waiting, Ddee and Kristy pretended to fight for at least 20 minutes. I took what would have been some better pictures of them doing that, but my camera SUCKS so none of them looked anywhere near good.    urlLink   I think Ddee just kicked Kristy, but Im not sure.       urlLink   Kristy rushing Ddee.      urlLink   This thing is seriously attached to his head. (lol)    Once we got to the destination, we quickly realized it wasnt as  [insert gratifying adverb here] as it was made out to be. We thought at first we should name it the kiddy fair, but we liked the other name better. I had a headache, so I just acted as coathanger while the other three went on the grand total of two rides (the only ones that werent geared toward the 4 foot and under crowd). I got some  fairly good pics of them on the first ride.    urlLink        urlLink        urlLink      (Ok, so one fairly decent pic of them, two fairly good pics of the ride  lol)  We spent a whole half hour of quality fun time at the fair and then proceeded back to the bus stop, where we waited for... over an hour for the next bus. The stop happened to be next to a building which had an overhanging roof over a porch. This was good for poor Ddee who was far too hot in a sweatshirt, in the blazing (relatively) sun.     urlLink   Andrew looks like hes got the whole ape thing goin on, but dont worry, hes just on his cell.      urlLink   If this isnt Hickville, then I dont know what...      urlLink    My question is how to get the vehicle up there to begin with. Who knows, maybe YEEHAAs 4x4 enough (man enough in the truck world)    After the bus finally got there, we had to share it with four rather intoxicated 20-some-odd year old guys who didnt seem to have a problem spreading the news that yes, you will get drunk in the beer garden.  After we got back to Portland, we ate dinner in the lower food court of Pioneer Place 2. (I wish Id gotten some pictures of that place, the fountains make it look sweet. :)  We had an uneventful bus ride back to the Washington Square (mall that we started at), and decided to browse around for a while, in search of a game for Andrews friend whos b-day party I was taking him to.    urlLink   Andrew and me in the WS Summit bathrooms... see Ddee, this has nothing to do with showers ;)    HAHAHA, somehow I lost my key to my car at the fair (at least I think I lost it at the fair), so I had to call my parents and have them come give me a spare key. Once they left, I took everyone home, well everyone but Andrew who I took to a restaurant which preceded a sleepover he was going to. He had KrispyKreme for breakfast the next day (lucky dawg).     urlLink   Is she yawning?? I cant tell.

      I didn't talk to her tonight. Well, actually it was last night, and I did talk to her, just not about that.   I got home from a *fun* day with  urlLink d'Dee ... (ok fine, Ddee) , her sister  urlLink Kristy  and  urlLink Andrew M. . Will post a TON more on that L8r, complete with some pics :)   Anyway, about Gwen: I got home from a *fun* da.... I just said that... ok moving on... Once I got home, I called her and asked if I could bring some DVDs and stuff that I had borrowed, up and she answered yes, but she seemed really tired. I drove them up and borrowed another DVD that my mom wanted (A Walk To Remember), but Gwen seemed so tired that I changed my previous plan of going back home and calling her to talk, to calling her tomorrow night.  btw, I got a messageboard up! :) Untill I set up my home-base webserver and translate my blog to that, I think this will do the job nicely. Though when I do start hosting from home, I'll get a little more elaborate.

      Listening to:  Andrew W. K. - Got To Do It   I had a long and meaningfull talk with my mom last night through this morning (Sorry Andrew, that's why I kept calling you back every half hour saying I was going to be longer - lol), and I'm feeling much better for it. She's great to talk too; it's amazing how much of this she understands. Anyway, I'm thinking (this was kinda her advice too) that I need to pull back from Gwen for a while, while this new relationship starts and give her some room to breath. I'm probably going to call her tomorrow night (well, tonight) and tell her that I know she's in a relationship with another guy now and I think I need to pull back and just let them figure each other out without my interaction as a hinderance. I'll probably finally say straight up that I'm in love with her and would be quite willing to have a closer relationship again should she so choose, but for the moment we need to tone down on how much we're communicating (i.e. I'm not going to call her every night and stay up for hours on end, talking anymore). I know that she wants to still keep our friendship alive, but I question whether our current interaction is really within the bounds of 'just a friendship'.  Feedback is more than welcome on this.

      *GRRRRAAAAAAAAAH!!!* to Comcast... my isp  (no not dialup). It cut out five minutes after I posted that last post, right when I need someone to talk too... Oh well, I just went to bed listening to  Sense Field - Save Yourself :  My self esteem, it's been low, go ahead and count it's been lower than low. / I know the feeling of it stealing life out from under me. / I want to learn, can you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you? / So many times we just give it away to someone who, couldn't even remember your name / Could you save yourself for someone who, loves you for you, loves me for me? / Give it away to someone who, someone who will cherish your name.   Hmm... speaking of music, I think I'll post some songs that I've been listening to / sing / humming / mumbling all day.  1.  AFI - This Time Imperfect    I cannot leave here.  I cannot stay. Forever haunted, more than afraid. Asphyxiate on words I would say. I'm drawn to a blackened sky as I turn blue.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me.  I cannot stay here.  I cannot leave. Just like all I loved, I'm make-believe. Imagined heart, I disappear. Seems no one will appear here and make me real.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak.   I'd share with you, could I speak, just how much this hurts me. I'd tell you how it haunts me.   Cuts through my day and sinks into my dreams. You don't care that it haunts me.  There are no flowers, no, not this time. There will be no angels gracing the lines, just these stark words I find. I'd show a smile but I'm too weak. I'd share with you, could I only speak, just how much this hurts me... just how much this hurts me...  just how much you...   2. the second half of  Drive Emerson - Only God (Could Stop Me Loving You)  (the beginning has some raunchy stuff in it)   Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to He sent you from heaven Just to make my dreams come true When he opened the door That you came walking through Only God could stop me loving you  There ain't no girl In the whole wide world Could tear us apart And there ain't no man Could steal your hand And tear us apart  But there is one God, In heaven above who gave me love strong enough, to calm my heart  Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you Only God could tell me not to Only God could stop me loving you   3. This one I heard on the radio three times today... kinda spoke to me, but I don't believe it in this case :|  Brooks Garth - Unanswered Prayers    Just the other night a hometown football game My wife and I ran into my old high school flame And as I introduced them the past came back to me And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  She was the one that I'd wanted for all times And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then I'd never ask for anything again  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams And I could tell that time had changed me In her eyes too it seemed We tried to talk about the old days There wasn't much we could recall I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  And as she walked away and I looked at my wife And then and there I thanked the good Lord For the gifts in my life  Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs That just because he may not answer doesn't mean he don't care Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered... Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

      Feeling: umm... there's too much emotion rolling through me to allow me to 'feel' anything for a while...  Gwen and I just conversed (how or why... it doesn't matter anymore) and in the course of our brief conversation, she told me a name: Richard. I guessed and got it right; her new boyfriend.  I think it's time to blow the dust off the old stack of emo music and wallow for a while.  "This goes out to the one I love..."  ok, while's up...  *sniff*

      wow... long time no post. I promised Laurie that I'd post something tonight (well, this morning now...) but I also just promised Gwen that I would get to bed very soon, and you know how it is with girls - just can't turn them down (well.... for most things). So, I shall be brief.  Several of my computers are up and running including my main (soon to be sub-main) Windows box, which I am currently on.  I successfully reformatted it and installed the new OS, but dling all the new drivers and patches... well that's still taking some time. I just took then case apart again today to replace the old drab green and yellow LEDS with red and blue Super-brights. Man, what a difference... those things are powerful!  I talked to Laurie on IRC earlier today for the first time in... hmm almost a week.  We agreed that I would call her at 8 my time, 9 her's, tonight but, I FORGOT MY PHONE when I went to church!!! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr* to all things regrading my memory (lol).  I'm going to the beach tomorrow, kinda against my wishes... I had thought that the trip was planned for next week, but got canceled because of VBS... oh well.   I called Gwen around 10:30 tonight and got her dad. He told me that she would call me back shortly, so I waited for... well it turned out to be 45 minutes... not untill she called me back, but untill I started thinking and realized that my phone was back in the car again!!! (after I had gotten it out of the house, after I  had forgotten it when I wanted to call Laurie... lol). I went out and checked, and sure enough, she left a voicemail 25 minutes earlier. I called her back and evidently woke up her dad, but she said it didn't matter so whatever. At one point we were talking about the terrible amount of sleep I get and she kept trying to think of ways to get me to go to bed earlier. (lol) She wanted to talk to my mom, so I gave the phone to her and they conspired (I could hear the entire conversation, and contributed to it) to set a bedtime for me and how on earth to enfoce it. My mom suggested tying me to my bed every night for several weeks untill it became habit to get to bed that early, but I thought clorephorm (spelling?) would work better. (LOL) Eventually my mom gave the phone back to me, and Gwen and I continued talking, with my mom randomly grabing the phone from me now and then and interjecting comments like, "Well, we used to tell him when he was younger that 'If he weren't so cute, he'd be in a whole lotta' trouble by now'" (HAHAHAHA) My mom's great. Gwen was laughing about that for a while. 'Ne way, I did tell her I'd get to bed soon, so I should stop talking about us talking about me getting to bed soon, and get to bed soon :)   Sleep well, my beloved ones. Sleep well.

      I think I'll post about what's been happening (not much) over the last couple days, a little later today, though I will give this free piece of adivece: Sitting infont of two computers for 10 hours straight, burning backup cds so you can format them is INCREDIBLY boring.   Another great country song:     What The World Needs - Wynonna Judd    I look around at all the faces and I see All the lonely people looking back at me Rich,poor don't matter we're all the same Everybody's hungry in a different way We're clawing and climbing and kicking and screaming And fighting but really  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  La da la da da  Sometimes all it takes is just a smile To change somebody's weather chase the clouds out of the sky Sometimes you got to give and not receive Sometimes you got to live what you believe Open your arm's 'cause that's where it starts Right here with you and me  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around That's what the world needs now  Nobody likes the cold We all need someone to hold No one wants to be alone  What the world needs now is love Love and only love A little help from up above A way to make a better day Let's come together lay our difference down Spread it all around (That's what the world needs now)  What the world needs now (What the world needs now is love) (Love and only love) Love and only love (A little help from up above) (A way to make a better day) Let's come together lay our prejudices down

                  HAHAHAHAHA, this is so great :) I was cruising the web earlier today and ran across  urlLink this site  on a link from another blog,  urlLink SuperfastComputer.com . It's dedicated to hosting a video growing ever more famous, called " urlLink Star Wars Kid ". The following is a quote from it:   Ghyslain, whose parents requested that his last name be withheld, is the so-called Star Wars Kid featured in a hilarious but oddly poignant video that has been downloaded more than a million times since its release to the Web in late April. In the clip, Ghyslain brandishes a golf ball retriever that serves as a double-bladed light saber, enthusiastically re-enacting a series of battle maneuvers inspired by the feats of evildoer Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace. When a group of schoolmates discovered the videotape, they put it on the Internet, and within days it was a cause celebr.  The Ghyslain clip soon caught the attention of Web bloggers Andy Baio and Jish Mukerji, who posted it to their respective sites. Its obvious comedic appeal aside, Baio recognized in Ghyslain a kindred spirit. I'm a computer programmer, and I was unpopular in high school, except for some like-minded, geeky friends, Baio said. Yes, he looks silly and awkward. But at the second level, you just identify so much.  Visitors to Baio's site, www.waxy.org, began posting comments on the video  not all of them civil.  Some of the comments were really positive. People were writing things like, I was like him in high school, Baio said. But a lot of them  a disturbing number  were incredibly mean-spirited. It made me mad. All of these people calling him fat-ass or loser, and it's completely hypocritical  I mean, all the traffic was coming from technology sites, videogame sites, and Star Wars and Star Trek sites.  So I turned off the comment function, deleted the negative comments and posted a message to the effect that You're trashing one of your own, and all you geeks and nerds and dorks need to evaluate how you're behaving.  When one of Ghyslain's schoolmates guilty of posting the video contacted Baio and mailed him the teen's contact information, Baio and Mukerji called Quebec. [Ghyslain's] initial and understandable reaction was that he was unsure of my intentions, Mukerji said. But he opened up quickly. He's an intelligent young man. He was very guarded, but by the end of the conversation, he was very jovial.  Baio and Mukerji didn't stop there. They established a Web fundraiser with the stated aim of collecting enough money to buy Ghyslain an iPod, and the response has far exceeded their expectations  as of May 19, they had amassed more than $1000, and thanks to an anonymous $500 donation, Baio expected the tally to top $2000 by the end of the day. The plan is to now buy Ghyslain his own iBook.  The video was going to spread around the Web anyway  hopefully this will help, and if nothing else, he has an iBook to keep him company, Baio said. And he also learned that geeks look out for each other.     urlLink  Sign the petition to get Ghyslain into Star Wars Episode III!

      Ok, stuff about last week that I havent yet told you: Gwens family was in California from Sunday till well, the next other Sunday. (lol)  I was taking care of her dog Rascal (a beautiful white, Golden Retriever) all week while they were away (cept the last two days when her brother whos in college was back in town). Two weeks ago, next Tuesday, I was at her house for a couple hours while they were showing me everything I needed to do. (btw, that was the day that she gave me a haircut)  For some reason they wanted to take the entire ride down to the Los Angels area (16 hour drive) in one day, so they planned to start out at 2 am. I called her at 1:30 to wake her if she wasnt already up, but she had woken a couple minutes before I called.   I went to sleep and woke up around 8, before church Rascal seemed fine so I didnt worry about her until later. After church, I went with Goodys family over to a park near their house for a family reunion thingy (no Im not part of their family technically  lol). It was so stinking hotI left their after an hour or so and went to the other side of town to another park where my dads small group (formerly also my moms) was having a picnic. Josh M, Jesh, Josiah and Emily were there, and we talked for a while. I got the opportunity to try out phones new AIM compatibility  its ok, but IT WONT SIGN OFF WHEN YOU WANT IT TO!!!  Annoying since it seems to interfere with calls and other operations. Josh, Jesh, Josiah and I stayed a while after everyone else left then went to Joshs house. On the way to Joshs I stopped at Gwens house to take care of Rascal for a while and was rather stunned to see her (Rascal, not Gwen) hanging around outside the front door At first I thought that Id been extremely negligent and not locked the gate (which I know I check before I left), so I put her back into the yard and started the other direction to go check the mail. When Rascal suddenly appeared beside me again, I decided that I could not have been stupid enough to mistake the gate being locked twice, so I started to think about it for a minute and almost immediately I noticed the sizable hole in the fence and the corresponding hole that she dug in the ground under it. After much phone conversation, we determined that I shouldnt board up the fence, only fill up the hole and that I should leave Rascal in the house during the day, not outside in the back yard. Because of this, I spent around an hour extra with her every evening just to keep her company.  Remember back in my June 22nd post, when I talked about how much of an impact Gwen has had on my life, and that Ive never told her? Well I was planning to spend a considerable amount of time every day that she was gone, writing a letter which I would leave for her, explaining all of it. I had set it as a pretty high priority in my mind - thats why I think it was by Gods hand that I did not write it It was so important to me that I do, but whenever I would sit down and start to write, I would get sidetracked or not be able to concentrate or something. Weird. Oh well, I guess Ill just have to trust Him and see what He will work through all this.  O, I wrote Gwen that email back when she was on the Canada trip (my July 8th post), and I was right (haha), she didnt check her email for almost two months. :-D Ne way, heres her reply:    armaan, you were right about my e-mail habits. i thank you for the prayer and tell your  friends thank you for me too. tell them to keep praying that what happened on  the trip would have a lasting affect on their lives. stay happy gwen   So people who were praying, be ye thanked. :)  Oh, another thing, I sent her a backward survey a long time ago and she just sent it back to me. One of the questions was do you love me? she answered as a friend and a brother in Christ. When I sent it back to her, I thought about it for a while and wrote I care about you in a way, not necessarily romantic, but still special. It made sense to me at the time, but now as I look back on it, I find myself more leaning toward the word romantic as a describer again. Hmm I dunno

        urlLink     umm...... ok..... moving on.....  Man, I've been running non-stop all week doing various things (most if not all of them fun), but have been getting very little sleep and am starting to lag behind on things that I had previously set as priorities.  On Wednesday night, our Senior Pastor was out of town, so  urlLink Pastor Bill Ritchie  from  urlLink Crossroads Community Church  came and gave a wonderful message. Man, that guy is funny. :) Probably one of the funniest this he did was call TBN the 'big hair channel'. (I'll post an audio clip of that later...) :-D He's really hard to record though; quite animated - constantly walking around the stage.  Chatting on Youthfire yesterday morning was interesting... Everyone was talking about butts from the time that I got on till a couple hours later... specifically Chelsea gawking about a pic of Phil's butt that Sam took... umm... yeah... next subject.  Youth group last night was cool, the majority of the Junior High was (is still) on an all-week campout, so it was just the 40-or-so of us Senior Highers. Everything was really impromptu. Steven and I randomly got up and led worship with Andrew (who played the guitar) then Ryan finished a series on a book title The Case For Christ. Was a pretty good book to read and study through. I'd recommend it to anyone.  Later after youth group was finished - about 9, I called Laurie again and talked to her for around ten minutes. It's kinda funny; I was running all over the place trying to help set up sound stuff for some people (Steven, Matt, Jeremy, Adam and Kelly) while talking to her. She had limited time to talk, so I handed her over to Steven after about ten minutes then they talked for... four or five minutes then he gave her back to me and we said goodbye. Haha, it was nice talking to her for more than 40 seconds this time. :)  Great "All-American" country song:    Keith Urban - Where The Blacktop Ends lyrics    Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  I'm lookin' down the barrel of Friday night Ridin' on a river of freeway lights Goodbye city I'm country bound 'Til Monday rolls around  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Workin' in the grind is an uphill road Punchin' that clock and carryin' that load I bust it all week and then I'm free The weekend belongs to me  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Give me some fresh air give me that farm Give me some time with you in my arms Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul, you betcha  Gonna kick off my shoes And run in bare feet Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends Where the blacktop ends

      Man Friday night was funny. Cameran came over and we and my sister and her friend (who also spent the night) burned and melted stuff outside for like two hours. We started creating 'pyro art' or something in the air with WD40 by catching the flame with it and moving the stream all over the place then passing the flame back and forth from person to person. Hey, did you know that melting plastic bags make a really cool 'ziiiiiiiing' sound when they drip? O, or did you know that glowsticks explode when you toss them in a fire? (LOL)  Come Saturday, Cam and I went over to the Gadeholt's house from when 'Uncle' Greg, 'Auntie' Irene, Timy and we went to Multnomah Falls (3rd highest in N. America) and climbed 8 miles from the base up to Larch Mountain. The entire assent was something like a 4,900 foot increase in elevation. The average grade of the trail we followed was 13.75%. After the fourth hour or so, Cam, Timy and I discovered that it was actually easier to run up certain parts of the trail than to walk up. :) The scenery was spectacular though - myriads of little waterfalls running down the stream on either side of the trail. At one point, we spent a good 20 minutes hurtling boulders into part of the stream... When I stopped for a moment and asked the cliff face (the direction that I was looking) why we were doing it, Uncle Greg responded "Because it's there". HAHA   Man school's backing up and I've got even more h/w than usual... have no idea why I'm even taking time to write this (lol) Goodnight.

      Man,  Lonestar - Not a Day Goes By  is such good (i.e. sad) song....   Got a picture of you I carry in my heart Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark Got a memory of you I carry in my soul I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by  I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark Wishin' you were next to me, your head against my heart If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by  Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way  Not a day goes by that I don't think of you After all this time you're still with me it's true Somehow you remain locked so deep inside Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

      Ok, well I'm still up and Ddee wanted me to post, so I think I will. Mind you though that it'll be tiny cause I'm tired and want to get to bed.  I just got back from my school's annual Fall retreat to Winema, a Christian campground on the beach. This Winema was one of many firsts for me: It was the first one I've been to as a junior. it was the first time I've been there and not climbed on, or even seen for that matter, the 60 foot tall rock on the shoreline that everyone loves. It's the first time I've felt God lead me not to get into the worship, it's the first time I've hung out with... almost every group of people for an extended period of time. It's the first time I've felt unwanted by the class above me (if only for a short while) and it's also the first time I've ever missed someone so much who was there with us the entire time.  Sometimes firsts are good, and other times...  Goodnight ... may we all die restfully in our sleep that we may escape this world and all its grief.

      No, I'm not dead, I'm still very much alive and running :) ... and actually that's exactly the problem... oh, no not the alive part, I'm refering to the running part. You see, this school year and the weeks leading up to it have proven to be the busiest I've ever had. With all the homework and other activities I have going, this is the first time I've even gotten on the web recreationally, in... 5 days... yeah that sounds about right. The only reason I'm posting is I may not have time to email Laurie back, replying to her voicemail(s) ~lol~ earlier and I wanted to get through to her that I had gotten them, if for some unforseen reason I could not call her back tomorrow. Incidently, those voicemails only became voicemails because my STUPID PHONE DECIDED TO DIE ON ME EARLIER TODAY!!! (Don't worry it's better now, but the battery still has issues.) Anyway, I have no idea how frequently I will be able to keep posting for a while, but let me assure you that I haven't forgotten about all ya`   I miss yah all you Youthfire'ers, hopefully will chat again soon!  ~Armaan_running

      CAM'S NOT MOVING!!! The company his dad applied for already found someone for the job! :) Sweetness.  This Friday, Andrew and I are prolly staying over night at Cam's then we're all going back over to Andrew's ... not sure what we're gonna do to fill the time but it should be interesting.   I'm really sucking at school right now... Calc. and Spanish are still Fs and Sign's starting to head down that way too... I have had so many phreaking 1st period tardies that every time I'm tardy do, I get ISS (LOL). Thankfully it's only once a week, but still ... crazy. I keep missing key days in Chemistry so I'm behind in that right now too... not sure what I'm going to do... My uncle's thinking it might be best to drop Calc. do preCalc for another year, but that would seriously screw with my class lineup... not something I'm hoping for.   Anyway, I've got a paper that's worth 16 grades due in Senior English tomorrow, so I'd better get going... not sure if I'm gonna be on tonight, but whatever...  O, btw I'm going to a opera on Nov. 6th with a group that Rachaels' (am I spelling your name correctly?) conveniently a part of (thankyouthankyou now Im not going to be stuck with just 9 middle schoolers - nothing against them as a whole... just this particular bunch can be sometimes rather ... annoying). I've invited Cam and Ddee too, and I might even be able to get Josh to go along, but so far only Cam and Ddee are showing interest. (Andrew, wanna get some culture? WELL THEN STAY AT HOME WHILE THE REST OF US GO TO THE OPERA!!! ... jk jk, but I really doubt that would be your 'cup of tea')

      Man, I'm dying daily untill Friday.... This is going to suck soooo bad if Cam's moving. God...   to all the people who don't already know: Cam's dad's all excited about a potential job offer that would relocate his family to Texas... They were originally going to know today whether he got it or not, but the date's been moved to Friday. His mind seems to be made up: he gets the position and they're moving. It'll prolly take like two months to get ready and stuff, but then again there's no guarantee that they'll even be here for Thanksgiving.  holy crap, this is going to suck...

      I'm tired and ned to do some homework, clean my room and practice piano, but I'm going to Ddee's office in a minute for a bible study so I guess that'll all have to wait until I get back.   I'm reather unhappy about some of the scores I've been getting in subjects at school, particularly Spanish and AP Calc. I got flippin' 48% on my last Spanish test! 'Course it doesn't help that I didn't study anywhere near enough for it (lol). Oh, and I've already gotten ISS (In School Suspension) for tardies this early into the year. I drop my sister off at her school before I get to mine almost every morning, but her school's really weird about their closed campus policies. They won't even let her get out of the car until one of the staff opens the door for her. It's sooo stupid and it's costing my my GPA (ISS means less time in the class, which means less time learning).   Oh well, I'd better head over to Portline. See yah'all later~

      Grrr.... annoyance of annoyances - I'm borrowing Brady's iPod, uploading a ton of music on it, and copying it all onto Andrew H's computer, but things are being temperamental... First, the iPod was formatted using the newer Mac filing system which is all well and good when listening to music or syncing to a Mac, but I happen to be an all-pc guy (hope to change that soon) and so does Andrew H. It seemed that the only thing to do was to reformat the iPod with a FAT32 filing system and reload the OS. I was reluctant to do that because I wanted to upload some of Brady's music onto my computer as well, and reformatting it obviously erases all the data, so that wouldn't work. I started experimenting with random pc-based apps that allow communication with Mac formatted media. Finding little to no success in this, I was about to give up until I found Xplay, the app that made iPods for pc uses possible when the only format you could encode an iPod in was Mac. I installed that, but unfortunately, there was a data transfer problem in which the entire computer would lockup and eventually bluescreen. I retried this approach twice, but decided to discard since I was getting nowhere fast. I downloaded iPod OS 2.1 and used the installed to reformat the iPod. This took substantially less time that I had expected and I figured I was home free from this point on. Not so. My firewire port was evidently messed up, more often than not, it would only allow a small portion of a song to transfer before giving me some type of error message. I eventually gave up on that and decided to switch to usb, but that had its own complications: first, the high-speed (usb 2.0) controller wasnt loaded, so the connection was heinously slow. Second, the usb port does not power the iPod, but the firewire does, so I had to concoct an elaborate set of steps in order to reconnect the iPod whenever I wanted to transfer something: plug in the firewire, take five minutes (because the comp. kept freezing during this time) to disable it, and then plug in the usb and hope that everything worked. If not, I would have to restart the iPod and sometimes manually power down the entire computer and restart it.

      LOL, this is funny:  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=thefirebreathes.blogspot.com  (it may take a while to render though...)  you can browse almost any site like this, simple add  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  before the rest of the ULR. For instance, if you wanted to browse www.yahoo.com in ... color ... (lol), you'd take the  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=  and add  yahoo.com  to form  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=yahoo.com   This seems to work for all html-based websites exept for a few notible ones (like  http://www.malfunction.org/fulifier/nph-fulify.cgi?URL=google.com ) that happen to have a different default language than http://www.malfunction.org/ 's and display the page in German among other things.

       http://www.patchdayreview.com/   (Info on Microsoft patches) When checking on the latest patches from Microsoft, I sometimes feel like I spend too much time translating the gibberish to see if I need the patch or not. Yes, even I have trouble understanding some of its contents. Bad, eh? PatchDayReview aims to explain Microsoft's patches in English. Plus, it has a thermometer next to each patch identifying the urgency (critical, important, moderate, or low) needed to implement the patch. The site uses mild bad language. Refer to the category list to find patches for specific software programs. With patches coming out far too regularly, rely on the Patch Guy instead of the updater. -Merl  This brief article is from  Windows Fanatics

      I added something new to my blog, it's called  Web Fire Escape . Its an interesting concept: imagine you're checking someone's blog at school or at work and your teacher / manager / any person you don't want to see the site walks up. With this tool you can simply click a link and immediately go to a website or application of your choice. The link  urlLink    is customizable, via a cookie that you can obtain from Gary (the creator)'s  site . My and Steven's redirection site of choice is  this .

      Listening to:  Offspring - Something To Believe In  Feeling: cheerful, happy  LOL My friend in English got a text message from his girlfriend at Jesuit that it was snowing, and the entire school was in an uproar in under an hour... a big group of people were going on a leadership retreat to the coast and if it's snowing down here it's bad news for a bus full of people crossing the Cascades. They were going to leave after school, but they decided to leave at noon to try and make it through the pass before they were snowed in.   Attendance has been down since Monday on account of random illnesses. In Calc today, we had three people. (lol) I love that class even though I currently suck at it. I've been thinking that I need to be tutored in order to get out of the rut that I'm in in that class, but the more I contemplate it, I realize that I just need to take it more seriously. If I spent half the time on hw for it that I did on this computer... dang.  Btw, I'm going to try to start posting more regularly now: every day, and prolly will start using this for more of a personal itinerary blog and journal than a diary. Most of my old posts were me pouring my heart out and everything, but I've got way too many people checking this thing now to be safe using it for that LOL  'Ne wayz, Ben's coming over in a few, so I need to go give my room some attention.

      Now that we've all had a day to think about it, and had some second opinions from a mechanic and such, it's starting to look like the entire accident wasn't my fault. First of all, the damage to my car shows that the max speed I could have been going was 5 mph. Also, in an intersection (like that one) that has no markings (stop signs etc...) the right of way always goes to the person on the right.  I was on the right.

      Ok, so I'm driving from the far side of Movies on TV (a theater, whose name is a spoof on the highway it borders - Tualatin Valley, or TV Highway) parking lot, toward one of three entrances, intent on exiting the property, when ahead of me, from my left, a Camry drives into view behind a blind corner (blind, only by the cars parked at it, not by nature of the corner itself). We are quite close to each other, each of us moving at a fairly rapid pace for a parking lot, but I do have just enough distance to stop and clear them if I slam on the brakes. Now, my brakes are of an odd sort - to begin with they're in a '92 Corolla, so anti-lock is not a possibility (or at least, not much of one). Second, even though they are quite powerful (I have come to a dead stop, decelerating from 55 mph in under 3 seconds on at least one occasion), the position of the petal is rather obscure. The accelerator, in perspective to the brake, is recessed almost two (maybe more, not quite sure now actually) inches. Furthermore, the width of clearance between the brake and the wall or sorts to the right of the gas is almost identical to that of my shoes. Ok, now back to the story: Bearing all of this is mind, its easier to understand how, when I try to rapidly transition from gas to brake, my foot becomes stuck underneath the brake petal and when I floor what I think is the brake, Im actually swiftly accelerating. Now, Im sure the outcome of this petal orientation issue is readily apparent, so it goes almost without saying that I strike the Camry, even while attempting to swerve out of the way. What is not readily apparent though is that the damage that occurs to my left, front wheel upon impact jams it into a hard-right turn and sends me careening straight at a parked month-old Lancer. Thankfully, there is a small curb and sidewalk between my still accelerating car (foot stuck behind brake petal, remember?) and the shiny new, well-into-the-five-digit costing vehicle in front of me, that manages to catch my right wheel (the only one at this point free to steer) and allows me to narrowly miss totaling the Lancer, and instead simply remove the right rear tail light. By the time I am nearly passing the object which turned this into a three car accident, I have managed to disentangle my foot and sharply apply my brake little good that it did with my left wheel banking sharply against the other three though.   All in all, the entire left side of my car is heavily marred, the driver door is bent, the left front wheel's hydraulics are destroyed (estimated $400 repair), and the right front bumper is imploded. The Camry got most of the body in front of the engine removed, and the top of the right wheel well is pretty much gone too. The Lancer had the most minimal damage, but possibly the most costly, seeing as it's less than a frigin' month old.

      HAHAHA, let's all thank Ddee for this ... interesting email:   In Japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft Error messages with Haiku poetry messages. Haiku poetry has strict construction rules. Each poem has only three lines, 17 syllables: five syllables in the first line, seven in the second, five in the third.   Haikus are used to communicate a timeless message often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight through extreme brevity  the essence of Zen:   Your file was so big.  It might be very useful.  But now it is gone.   The Web site you seek  Cannot be located, but  Countless more exist.   Chaos reigns within.  Reflect, repent, and reboot.  Order shall return.   Program aborting:  Close all that you have worked on.  You ask far too much.   Windows NT crashed.  I am the Blue Screen of Death.  No one hears your screams.   Yesterday it worked.  Today it is not working.  Windows is like that.   First snow, then silence.  This thousand-dollar screen dies  So beautifully.   With searching comes loss  And the presence of absence:  "My Novel" not found.   The Tao that is seen  Is not the true Tao-until  You bring fresh toner.   Stay the patient course.  Of little worth is your ire.  The network is down.   A crash reduces  Your expensive computer  To a simple stone.   Three things are certain:  Death, taxes and lost data.  Guess which has occurred.   You step in the stream,  But the water has moved on.  This page is not here.   Out of memory.  We wish to hold the whole sky,  But we never will.   Having been erased,  The document you're seeking  Must now be retyped.   Serious error.  All shortcuts have disappeared.  Screen. Mind. Both are blank.

      On the  Matrix, Revolutions : (a portion of a  review from MSNBC.com ) "theres still too much dialogue that comes from the wherever you go, there you are school of circuitous profundity."   Ever since the disappointment of Reloaded, theres been some question as to whether it was a good idea to spring another Matrix installment on moviegoers within the same calendar year. Remember what happened to Back to the Future 3, released just a few months after Back to the Future 2? It faded so quickly that most fans of the original didnt even realize the series had switched genres, from time-travel fantasy to full-scale Western.  Nevertheless, the third installment in the Matrix trilogy is already here, and there is no genre-switching. Alas. Once more, Neo the potential messiah (Keanu Reeves) is joined by his main squeeze Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and the fatherly Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to do battle with a software-created world and the shape-shifting malevolence of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).     Once more there are multiple Smiths (and Weavings), and theyve taken over the body of Neos schizzy shipmate, Bane (Ian Bliss). The reluctant Frenchman Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) is persuaded to help out, while The Oracle, chain-smoking dispenser of cookies and fortune-cookie wisdom, turns up in the shape of Mary Alice. (The late Gloria Foster played her in the first two films, and the change is cutely acknowledged.)  Unlike Reloaded, this new Matrix doesnt leave the audience hanging in mid-narrative. Producer Joel Silver claims this really is the end, even if the finale does hint at more installments to come. But Revolutions still makes most of the same mistakes as Reloaded.   The Wachowskis, Andy and Larry, replace clever plotting with furious action, then substitute massive sets and special effects for character development. And theres still too much dialogue that comes from the wherever you go, there you are school of circuitous profundity.   Under the circumstances, the actors can do little but stay out of the way of the heavy machinery  which includes a ferocious drill that breaks through Neos pals defenses and threatens to wipe out the human race. Theres a Star Trek cheesiness about too many of the performances; the romantic chemistry between Reeves and Moss has never been harder to buy.  A few touches surprise: an impromptu trip through a packed disco, the brutal exit of one major character, and a subway stop that operates on principles similar to Harry Potters train station. Neo finds himself stranded in this purgatory, punished by a grotesque creature who thinks hes God and wont let him leave.  OK, you got yourself in here, says Neo to himself. You can get yourself out. The way Reeves says it, he might be thinking about his career.

Word of Advice: I have no advice so Ill keep Stevens >>   The years fly by faster and faster as you get older (or so it seems). Take a step back and realize that the pain and suffering you might be feeling at the moment will pass, and the year will pass. Enjoy your young carefree years while you still have them, they are slowly shrinking, at the same time, don't be afraid to take responsibility

      I don't know how this is going to work... I get too attached to things and its sooo hard to let go. Whats happening now is that theres a very high possibility that Im going to be switching schools within the coming weeks. I cant function at mine right now; its becoming more and more apparent the more research we do, that Ive got a rather severe form of ADD thats really effecting my ability to learn at Faith. Im really saddened by the prospect because Ive got some wonderful friends there, and not to say that Ill be losing those friends automatically when I leave, its just going to be a huge amount harder There is one bright side to all this though the school that I might be transferring to is Beaverton High, Stevens school.

      Listening to: The Ataris  Boys of Summer  Saturday, I was really depressed all day long and for some reason, didnt sleep at all that night. I read Stevens blog at something like 5am and in it he said that he was prolly pulling an all-nighter, and sure enough, he was on aim, so we talked for a couple hours. He bailed though and slept through church (lol). I got back home and slept from 2pm till past 7:30pm. At something like 8:30, someone knocked at my door, and assuming it was my sister (who was currently being hyper with three equally hyper friends), I opened it. It turned out to be Adri who was returning my overcoat that I had left at her house last week. Eventually we (Melissa too, who was with Adri) went over to Joshs house from some reason, picked him up and went to the Gadeholts. We stayed there for a bit then visited Christine the restaurant where she works, visited Joshs brother at his work, and went to Starbucks. We went back to Adris house with our drinks and ice cream (obtained from the restaurant) in tow, but left again because we didnt want to wake up her parents with all our noise. We went back to the Gadeholts house (Christine was off work by this time) and ate our ice cream and such Since it was approaching midnight, we decided to get back to our houses, and on the way back to mine, we noticed that the snow that had been falling all night was finally sticking :) (lol - awesomeness). Once Adri and Melissa (who was staying at Adris) got back home, they called me and we talked for 3 hours and 20-something minutes (lol).   I woke up just before noon today and got ready to go out to lunch with my grandparents. Before we got there though, we stopped at a couple random parking lots Southridge etc and did some power-driving on the slick roadways. Man, thats a nice VW that they have :). We went out for lunch, went back to house, and Ralph and I took off to go get me some experience driving a manual transmission on slick roads. Turns out that Im too big for the drivers seat of his truck (lol  annoying non-moving steering column).

      Listening to:  Foggy  Your Eyes  (great techno)   In your eyes I see the sun shine.  It's so bright that I can't see.  And this wall is so much stronger, Than everything that I've seen before.   In your eyes, I see flowers and trees.  In your eyes, I see beautiful things I can't believe.  Cause in your eyes I see the love that shine on me.  In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes.  I see the blue skies bring some rain I feel the blood rush in my veins I never want to see you cry. Recently you said good night, Did not believe it for a while But you really meant goodbye.  In your eyes I see the sun shine.  It's so bright that I can't see.  And this wall is so much stronger,  Than everything that I've seen before.   Well, have a Merry Christmas and such! Im off to hear my moms concert and then to my grandmas house to have a little family get-together.

      Well, I guess I should write a bit about the last few days, so here goes:  On Friday, before I even left school, Cam, Xbox in tow, got to my house. I joined him shortly (lol) and he gave me a pair of gay, see-through, Santa Claus boxers (LOL). Andrew arrived with his Xbox and TV around 7 that night and we set about setting the three consoles up, interconnected via my home network. We did random stuff including watching several movies until Andrew and I finally bedded down close to 6am (Cam had taken shelter and fallen asleep in our large unfinished basement / storage area adjacent to my room back at 3am.  Cam woke up at 8 and finally got me up at 10:30. We both then dragged Andrew out of the storage area, into my room where he refused to actually get up till past 11 (lol). Ddee, Kristy, and Brady got to my house just past noon and we all waited with baited breath (er, no) for everyone else to arrive at 1:30. In all, the attendees were Cam, Andrew, Brady, Kristy, Ddee, Vlad, both Katies, Kelli, Steven, Brandon, Josh, Jennifer, Adri, Melissa, Kat, Becky, Mandy, Danie, Lisa, Young Hee, my family and me. We did so many random things over the course of the afternoon that I can barely remember specifics. When my parents finally got home (a couple hours late) with the pizzas etc, we started planning how we were going to get over to Zoo Lights. Eventually, everyone who was coming had a ride figured out, and it ended up that Steven, Adri and I were all riding with Brady.   We had fun at Zoo Lights. We rode the train, admired the lights shining through the mist ( fog whatever), group hugged random people dressed up as animals you know, same ol, same ol. Most of us stopped for Coffee at Starbucks on the way back Adri and Steven got into some type of signing war, er, I dont know what was going on (lol). Anyway, once we got back home, almost everyone had left, save Steven and Brady (who were staying the night) and Adri, Melissa and Katie. Adri stayed a while after even after Katie and Melissa left  that was cool, we all talked for a while. Right after she left (past 12) we went down to Stevens house and grabbed his computer paraphernalia. Later, Steven Brady and I pulled one of the servers out of the garage, and worked for a few hours, but got almost nothing accomplished except for downloading a few drivers onto my computer. We went to sleep close to 3:30 (or at least I did)  [Um Its like what? 1:22am, and Brent just called me and asked if I had my car. Im like Nooo why?, and hes all Ok, talk to you later then, bye.  strange kid (LOL)]   Anyway, We woke up the next morning somewhere between 10am and 1pm (dont remember) and spent all the time working on the server and copying files back and for between Stevens and my computer. We called and told Adri that wed be at her part like an hour and a half early, but we sorta lagged behind and got there within 15 minutes of 5, the official start. We brought my Xbox but didnt set it up until an hour later when Brady, Steven and I went back to my house and grabbed a TV. Later, Melissa and I went out to exchange the dvd that Adri had rented (the Ring) because it was horribly scratched. That was annoying because they didnt have another dvd edition in stock, so we had to settle for a vhs. I heard that Brady kinda made a fool out of himself while I was gone, and I kinda noticed it a bit when I got back too. He just gets too [Insert lengthy, complete silence as all who know, contemplate how to describe it] ...in a big group of people. WhateverOh, incidentally, Gwen was there and brought Richard, who I finally got to meet (well see is the more appropriate word there was no meeting involved). Once they left, I was like, holy crap, now I can act normal again.  Steven stayed the next night again and came with us to a dinner at Madison House, a division of Good Samaritan ministries. We found a ton of Linux stuff on the fourth floor and a collection of something like a thousand Star Trek movies (and episodes on tape) in a movie room on the first floor.

      At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industry with the auto industry and stated: "If GM had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-five dollar cars that got 1000 miles to the gallon." In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued a press release stating the following.  If GM had developed technology like Microsoft, we would all be driving cars with the following characteristics:  1. For no reason whatsoever your car would crash twice a day.  2. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buy a new car.  3.  Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and you would just accept this, restart, and drive on.  4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn, would cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case you would have to re-install the engine.  5. Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought "Car95" or "CarNT". But, then you would have to buy more seats.  6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but would only run on five per cent of the roads.  7. The oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single "general car fault" warning light.  8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.  9. The airbag system would say "Are you sure?" before going off.  10. Occasionally for no reason whatsoever, your car would lock you out and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door handle, turned the key, and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.  11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe set of Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even though they neither need them nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately cause the car's performance to diminish by 50 percent or more. Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation by the Justice Dept.  12. Every time GM introduced a new model car buyers would have to learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls would operate in the same manner as the old car.  13. You'd press the "Start" button to shut off the engine.   found at  http://www.people.vcu.edu/~gasaunde/if_gm_built_cars___.htm

      Steven and I are working on those servers currently. We found we're lacking something called a Smart Start CD for configureing the SCSI arrays... we might be able to find an iso that works but itls highly doubtful.... We may have to shell out $22 for buying it off the Compaq site.

      I got this in an email from ddee. It can be found at  http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/physics.asp  I'm currently printing multiple copies of it and plan on handing them out tomorrow at school. (LOL)   The Physics of Santa and His Reindeer  No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are 300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified, and while most of these are insects and germs, this does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer which only Santa has ever seen.   There are two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. BUT since Santa doesn't appear to handle the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish and Buddhist children, that reduces the workload to 15% of the total  378 million according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's 91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one good child in each.   Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second.   This is to say that for each Christian household with good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park, hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false but for the purposes of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75 million miles, not counting stops to do what most of us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding and etc.   This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second - a conventional reindeer can run, tops, 15 miles per hour.   If every one of the 91.8 million homes with good children were to put out a single chocolate chip cookie and an 8 ounce glass of 2% milk, the total calories (needless to say other vitamins and minerals) would be approximately 225 calories (100 for the cookie, give or take, and 125 for the milk, give or take). Multiplying the number of calories per house by the number of homes (225 x 91.8 x 1000000), we get the total number of calories Santa consumes that night, which is 20,655,000,000 calories. To break it down further, 1 pound is equal to 3500 calories. Dividing our total number of calories by the number of calories in a pound (20655000000/3500) and we get the number of pounds Santa gains, 5901428.6, which is 2950.7 tons.   The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium-sized lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer" (see above) could pull TEN TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight, or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases the payload (not even counting the weight of the sleigh) - to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison - this is four times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth. 353,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this will heat the reindeer up in the same fashion as spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb 14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each.   In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second. Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces 17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.   In conclusion: If Santa ever DID deliver presents on Christmas Eve, he's dead now.

      Yesterday evening, I went to my school's Christmas program and stayed for the full 90 or so minutes of it. That was pretty cool... there was one part where all the lights were turned off except a powerful black light in the middle of the stage, and people signed a song wearing black clothes with white gloves, so all you could really see were their hands.   Afterward, Adrie and I went to my youth group (there was still a half-hour or something left). It was the first time I've been there in over a month. Steven (not Sus, a youth leader) was talking about how we can still honor God in Christmas celebration by making the whole thing about Him, even though almost every symbol of the holiday and the holiday itself has pagan roots. Later Melissa and Gwen came for some reason... that was um... awkward... yeah  Anyway, Adrie, Steven and I eventually went back with Ben to his house for a bit to see his newly painted room. It's really cool - the wall that his organ sits against has a red sun painted on it such that the organ's in the center of the sun and rays of red shoot out across a yellow and orange sky. It looks really cool.

      Music Mood:  the Offspring - Denial, Revisited   So, yeah my dad surprised me with a new car a couple days ago... that was really nice of him. (New means new to me, not actually new.) It's a '95 Toyota Camry LE. It's the newer body style (a plus over the other one), it's got like, one tiny scratch, it drives great and it's just all around a wonderful car... Except for one fatal flaw... It stinks of cig smoke. Yeah, it sux bad... that stuff doesn't come out ever, oh you can clean the interior as well as you want, but leave it out in the sun long on a hot day and that smell will come seeping out of the metal in the roof and make the car reek again. Trouble is that among my dad's slowly failing senses, he's partially lost his sense of smell so he doesnt know how bad it really is. Plus the fact that he's the type of guy that won't believe that there's a hole in the middle of the road ahead of him until he slides right into it himself, so we can tell him all we want that the smell's not coming out and he's gonna try to get it out anyway. I feel really bad about pressing the issue because whenever I talked about the other car, I was almost always complaining (And very justifiably, that car had a butt load of problems), but he spent like, 5 hours at the dealer's auction just to get this car for me and I want to show my appreciation for that. But then again as Andrew aptly said, I "won't ever have to smoke, just keep the car for two years and it'll do the same thing."  Ah the problems of life...

      What I meant in my rather abrupt post earlier is that people around me for some reason try and find something wrong with someone, create a bandwagon, try to drag as many people onto it as they can, then set out to run over the person. It happens all too frequently... First the thing with Brady and the Rivas' .... I DON'T CARE WHO'S ****ING FAULT IT IS... GET OVER IT. (I know almost everyone has by now, but there are the lingering few). And then the stint with Cameran right after that... so he decides to try and get from all the emotional politics for a bit... big deal.   But what really honestly ticks me off is all the little bickering and nitpicking that goes on between people WHO'VE NEVER EVEN MET FACE TO FACE.... for God's sake... I mean, get a life... there are better issues to get bent out of shape about than your suddenly loosing your 73rd online friend because your 21st IMed them behind your proverbial back and they both decided they didn't like you.   Becky, you're right about people (including me) not helping at all by posting demeaning things or leaving demeaning comments on other's blogs, but I still think you could've been a little more tactful with the posting of your little altered poem there. You're right about it being your journal, diary, whatever, but it's also been transformed into a means of communication to other people simply by virtue of its being accessible to essentially all humanity.

      Current Music:  Nina Gordon - Tonight and the Rest of My Life   Well, here I am nearly at 2:00am... on a school night... again... I've been finding myself doing this a lot lately and I think I've finally figured out why I deprive myself of sleep so often: I don't want to think. When I go to bed, I simply lie there, sometimes for hours, and over analyze every situation from my past or possibilities in the future that I can think of. I'll critique myself over and over again, sometimes focusing for days at a time on the same random event in my past that for some reason has been brought to mind. It's maddening to say the least. I feel like I'm slowly... every so slowly, going insane.  In related news, it would seem that my attention issues are getting steadily worse. I'm prolly going to have to forgo OMTA syllabus this year since I can't get my act together and practice regularly. This saying nothing about my completely failing my junior year... yeah, ain't life jolly?  Oh, one major point of happiness at the moment is that my school's Winter Banquette got cancelled because of the ice, so... I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER ALL!!!! *dances around*  ...We really should get a band of people together and rent a limo...  O, and there was one other thing that had me pretty happy today but I won't go into it.  And rest assured that I'm working hard to get the hundred or so pics from Vegas up, but it's turning out to be an undertaking of some proportion trying to find the names of all the different $20,000 - $160,000 speakers that I took pics of.  Pics that I've uploaded so far can be found  here .  Appendum: I just read Steven's latest post about not being motivated to do anything, even stuff that he wants to do, so I decided to add this to mine as well: I think that's also a major issue (dang I need a calculator to count all my issues now...) that I'm facing... I'll come home from school and simply sit around, not doing anything... no coding, no reading (I used to LOOOOOOVE reading), no random computer stuff.. I don't really even want to get into bed... I just sorta lose my will to do anything at all and just sit there... and sit there...   God I need help...

      Well, we drove through 160 miles of fog so dense, visibility was limited at times to less than 50 feet We hit a freak patch of ice, spun around more than two times while sailing over 100 feet across the freeway, hit a snow bank going backwards and ricocheted around before coming to a stop. Total damage to vehicle: Were still trying to find the damage we cant see any. Then, we drove another 30+ miles over icy roads and finally got back home. Oh, and that was all just this morning between 1 and 4 am.

      Good God, I hesitate to even post this, but... it must be done...  Gene Ray, a (to quote  urlLink Waxy.org ) "highly entertaining nutcase", says that there are four different simultaneous days within a single rotation of earth, and if you laugh at this, "you're stupid and evil and deserve to be spit on publicly." Before reading on, let me caution you by saying that anything within your reach while reading this article, is not safe: uncontrollable urges to destroy your monitor may follow.... That having been said, let me introduce his profound () ideology by quoting the first sentence on his site:     Creation of 4 simultaneous 24 hour days, within a single rotation of Earth, empowers me above all 1-day gods and educated stupid scientists. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.   He continues with another onslaught of wordy blather that, when sifted through, leaves him calling himself schizophrenic (which he misspells) and youthful, claiming to be above the "Wise Men" because of his establishing a "Chair of Wisdom", and goes on to curse Tom Green of all people, claiming him to be evil...  And that's just the next three sentences...  From  urlLink here  you can download his  urlLink interview  on TechTV, and if you really insist on torturing yourself, his homepage is  urlLink here   O, and I think he's watched a bit too much Peter Pan:  "Unless the children organize into a powerful force to stop the adult ramsacking of Nature, they must now prepare for the coming adult inflicted hell on Earth. "

      Enter   urlLink Earthstation 5 . You remember them don't you? The peer-to-peer software developer, hosted in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, that  declared war  on the entertainment industry and told them to "f*** off"? Well, seems they've grown a bit... In the occupied Palestinian territories, says Steve Taylor, a spokesman, Earth Station 5 is safe from the music and film industries' campaign to stop people sharing content for free. At any one time, claims Mr Taylor, almost 19m people are using Earth Station 5, most in non-English-speaking countries. If true, that would make it the most popular peer-to-peer file-sharing portal in the world. At the moment, everything is free on the platform, and it has no advertising. According to Mr Taylor, its backers are spending $2million a month with little if any revenue coming in. Eventually, their plan is to make money from online gambling, sports betting and ads. Well, maybe. But almost everything about Earth Station 5 may be fiction. Perhaps the only certain thing is that, at least for  urlLink The Economist , "it works."  portions of this post taken from  urlLink The Economist    In other news, even Iraqis like Counterstrike  (pictures from LAN cafes in Iraq)

      What to say about the last week... well, let's start with the physical: it's been snowy... and icy... and snowy... and icy....  yeah that's about it... school closures all around, though the roads are still somewhat drivable (I was out all day yesterday, cutting cookies in parking lots and driving up insanely steep, long hills (Im talking 500 foot elevation changes and 13.5% grade)  4-wheel drive is useful at times  In related news, all flights to and from PDX (Portland International Airport) have been grounded throughout the day, so the possibility of us getting in the air on time tomorrow is pretty grim. We were considering driving, but my dads against that. (Apparently hes not like Jon Marks family who drove 5 hours to a relatives, house I think grandparents, stayed a couple hours, and drove all the way back in the first day of Winter Break  lol)  *edit* he just called the airline and found out that our flight's still scheduled for tomorrow... so that shouldn't be a problem.  Friday  Saturday I had my big slumber LAN party thing. Half of the people thought it was a b-day party and half didnt so we got a cake and called it a sorta b-day party. Twas funny. Goody, David, Cam and Matt R. couldnt come I was kinda bummed about that. Cam didnt come cause he didnt have a ride, Matt didnt come because he was sick, and Im still not sure why Goody and David didnt come. Somehow or other, Goody heard about the party I had for friends from school and stuff and the surrounding three (LOL) sleepovers and I think was bummed that he wasnt invited. Looking back on it, I really should have invited him, but I was trying to keep the amount of people down at the party, and I was afraid that if I invited even one more person from Calvary, that I was going to have to invite everyone and that would have been something like 60 people from both school and church. Ah well, whats done is done.  Anyway, the party was great my tv gave up the ghost a few days ahead of time *stupid piece a ....*. Amidst the gaming consoles and general nerd-dom, we had boxing, wrestling, fast paced games of Cranium (wait, were heading back into the nerdness, arent we) lol

       urlLink www.naplesnews.com   Royal Phil's concert marked by conductor's solo encore  By PEG GOLDBERG LONGSTRETH, Special to the Daily News  February 13, 2004    Wednesday evening's standing-room-only concert at the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, turned out to be notable, not for the concert, featuring the world renowned Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but for the encore performance of its highly touted young conductor.   Daniele Gatti, the Royal Philharmonic's music director since 1996 and also the music director at the Teatro Communale in Bologna, returned to the stage following a standing ovation at the conclusion of Beethoven's "Eroica" Symphony to - I thought mistakenly - acknowledge the accolades of the audience.   Instead, this incredibly rude, ill-mannered, churlish, boorish young conductor, tripped over his enormous ego and, in the process, managed to insult and alienate an entire, enthusiastic, respectful audience who had paid nearly $100 a ticket for the evening.  He returned to lecture the audience.   In so doing he confirmed my growing suspicions of his conduct during the evening: Maestro Gatti is a graduate of the Bobby Knight School of Social Diplomacy.   That's right. Gatti, without benefit of a microphone and with a heavy Italian accent, let everyone in the hall know ... know what, exactly? I am going to paraphrase his comments, but I believe he essentially said the following, since others, including Myra Daniels, the president and CEO of the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, with whom I spoke Thursday morning, have confirmed my interpretation of Gatti's comments:  The Royal Philharmonic is an important, world-class orchestra. They have performed all over the world. For the past two weeks they have played nonstop performances. They have never played under such trying circumstances.   Gatti went on:  The Phil's acoustics suck. The stage sucks. The placement of his orchestra on stage sucked.  While trying to make out his comments, I glanced up at Daniels' box, fully expecting to see her stand and fall over the balcony in shock.   I am certain any number of pacemakers in the decidedly older audience  went into overdrive, as person after person reacted with shock.  A number of persons in the audience made the mistake of tittering, not certain what he was saying or why smoke was coming from his ears. He stopped the laughter dead in its tracks, said, "This is no joke. I am very serious," and a hush came over the audience.   His tirade over, he exited, as did, finally, the members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra who, prior to last evening, had performed here on three other occasions since Gatti's appointment in 1996.   People who had heard right were shocked and outraged. A number of them sought out the ushers to voice their outrage over Gatti's conduct. People stopped me and were calling Thursday morning to ask if I had ever seen anything like that.   One woman called Daniels to comment: "We honored him with applause and a standing ovation, and he told us we were idiots."   Many asked, rightly so, if there were a problem with the acoustics or the stage, what the audience was supposed to do about it?   Indeed.   Reflecting back, I should have known it was going to be a strange evening. There were hints - a portent, as it turns out, of things to come: Gatti failed to utter a simple sentence at the beginning of the concert, informing concertgoers the order of presentation was being switched, which left more than half the audience sitting through the entire first number (which was supposed to be Saint Saen's Cello Concerto) wondering where the cellist was.   In fact, the first hint Gatti was not a happy camper occurred when, at the conclusion of the first movement of the first number, many people in the audience committed a mortal sin: They applauded.   Let's face it. Applause between movements is considered a sign of ignorance and poor breeding by many music snobs. There is nothing unique about music audiences in Naples applauding, as opposed to the rest of the world. They do it everywhere. Even in New York.   OK, so it would be preferable if they hired someone to come out with an applause card, to eliminate any uncertainty about when it is all right to express enthusiasm at a classical concert.   But in the greater scheme of things, given so little to applaud in today's world, is this really worth getting your dander up? Wouldn't you rather they applaud at an inopportune moment rather than boo?   But that wasn't bad enough in Gatti's eyes: At the same time, at the conclusion of that movement, in accordance with the Phil's policy, an usher quietly seated six adults on the far right side of the auditorium. They created no disturbance whatsoever, nor is there anything unusual about such a seating policy.   Gatti chose that precise moment to turn toward them, fix them with his best Bobby Knight stare - you know the look: the one where the general faces you with his best stare, utters not a single word and, in the process, strikes terror in your heart - and waited until they had been seated to proceed with the second movement.   By now, everyone in the hall had turned to see what the "problem" was, when their seating otherwise would not have been noticed by 95 percent of the auditorium.   Believe me, no one applauded during the remainder of movements in the evening's three numbers. Gatti, without ever saying a word or turning to acknowledge the existence of the audience, anticipated the possible applause and shushed them with a hand movement behind his back.   In the midst of all these by now cumulative little signs the maestro was having a bad hair day of monumental proportions, he briefly stopped the performance of Beethoven's "Eroica," turned toward the concertmistress, glowered, and the entire violin section got up and physically closed ranks, moving so close to the edge of the stage, the hapless fifth violinist had to grab his chair as it toppled off the stage.   That said, I am going to sum up the concert by saying it was very good. I am going to tell you the audience was attentive, polite and enthusiastic following the conclusion of each number. I am going to tell you Silvia Chiesa, a passionate young cellist with whom I frankly was unfamiliar, gave a solid performance during the Saint-Saens piece, and I hope we have the opportunity to hear her perform again under less stressful circumstances.   Then I am going to tell you, since so many people have called to ask if I have ever seen anything like what happened last evening, that I have not.   I have seen many gaffes and disasters on stage or during performances in my lifetime:  I have seen children wet themselves during their student recital; a graduate student in voice (whom I was accompanying) suddenly vomit all over everything during her doctoral recital; an organ short out and go totally silent during the procession of an ultra-socialite's wedding. I have seen parts break or fall off instruments. Reeds split. Strings break. Professionals forget their parts and flee the stage. I have seen musicians topple off stage; chairs break; batons suddenly take leave and fly through the air.   But until Wednesday, I have never seen a highly touted, internationally much heralded conductor blow his stack, come back on stage following a standing ovation and berate the audience. Gatti could not be reached for comment on Thursday. In the midst of all this post-concert shock and outrage, I had a sudden epiphany: In the five-plus years since my husband and I relocated to Naples, we always continued to think of Indiana and its musical venues as home.   Wednesday night I became a full-fledged Neapolitan, proud of the wonderful Philharmonic Center for the Arts, proud of the tremendous growth its orchestra has exhibited since we moved here. Thrilled with many of its world-class guest performers, of all the musical riches this community offers. And in the process, I was ready to do battle with this  pretentious, angry little twit who ruined a wonderful evening of music for many of the  concertgoers.   He was unhappy with the setting? It was beneath him?   I don't think he will have to fret about those problems anymore. I doubt there is a snowball's chance in Hell he will ever be invited back.

      The Hoop-A-Thon was interesting... I went, watched Space Jam and ate food. lol  My dad just got my mom a replacement for her aging van - exact same car as mine, down to the year and the color. LOL Buuuut... she's got aluminum rims :) :) I'm stealing those... Oh, and her's might be a V6 rather than a V4, in that case we'd prolly just switch cars... teenagers like acceleration and she drives more than I do and would enjoy the fuel economy.  I'm currently obsessing with  Jimmy Eat World - the Authority Song  and    the Offspring - Amazed    Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown Cause everyone around's so hollow I'm alone Sometimes I think I'm going down But no one makes a sound They follow And I'm alone Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed Just to find tomorrow One more day and I'd be amazed Just to see it waiting And if I make it I'm still alone No more hope for better days But if I could change Then I'd really be amazed And when you know you can't relate To one more shiny face Your heart breaks No one cares And when you know you can't go on Cause everything is wrong Your heart breaks But no one's there

      Listening to:  The Authority Song    It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? The DJ never has it, J A M C Automatic. If those were Roy's headphones, you bet he'd play "What Goes On".  Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I? Oh I'm here, that means something doesn't it? Oh won't you dance with me a little bit? Oh you don't notice, I guess the music's too loud. It's how the hustle goes, see what the jukebox knows. Put my last quarter on, I play "Authority Song". Honesty or mystery? Tell me I'm not scared anymore. Say anything you want already I'm not scared anymore. Honesty or mystery? Want something else? Just tell me I'm not scared anymore. I got no secret purpose, I don't seem obvious do I? I don't seem obvious do I?   Yesterday, Cam and Andrew left for Vegas. They're going to be gone until the 7th of next month. This sux, I'm gonna be so bored. Ah well I have a ton of h/w to keep me occupied. I'm going to my school tonight for the annual 'Hoop-a-Thon'.. Speaking of which, I'd better get off and take a shower.

      Today was weird... I got up at 6:50, decided to fool myself into thinking I had enough time to take a shower, which I took. then got ready from school, rushed out the door, got my sister to her school just barely on time, and amazingly got to school... no, wait, I was late. School was normal funny weird *blahness* until 1:00 when David Kelly, AT, Zooha, Lenny, Tyler and I all randomly left class early, spent 20 minutes trying to figure out which car(s) everyone was going in, and got on the road, heading toward a Engineering expo / banquet downtown. Holy crap, that ride was crazy... David Kelly drove his own car and everyone else piled into mine. We had decided ahead of time that we were going to be following Kelly, but judging by his driving, that was the last thing he wanted (LOL). Everyone in my car kept screaming and yelling and being generally distracting. The ambient noise levels in my car increased exponentially in parallel with the level of irrationality of David Kelly's driving techniques. In any event, we got there safely.   Apon arrival at the Double Tree Hotel (accross from the Lloyd Center), we discovered that the event was reschedualled to start at 2:45 instead of 2:00 (Darn it, we could have taken the MAX like we wanted to to begin with.) Anyway, after having fun in the glass elevators jacking multiple snack bags from the stash, Lenny and Tyler boarded one bus to go tour Freightliner, and the rest of us boarded the other to go to PSU.   Once we go there, the 60 or so of us all broke off into smaller groups. Zooha and I were fortunate enough to get into the group with like, 7 people. The first place we stopped at was the  STAR Siesmic Lab , the centerpiece of which is a 10' x 10'  Seismic Shake Table . Now this table has got to be one of the sweetest things I've seen in a very long time... it weighs 6? tons, can handle loads of well over 10 tons, and is powered by twin 60 gpm hydralic pumps which give it 3 Gs of acceleration over its travel range of 6 inches. It's amazing (and a little unsettling) looking down into the lab and watching a 13 thousand pound table suddely vibrate 6 inches either direction, more than 5 times a second. Saying you can feel the entire building shake would be an understatment.   The next lab we went to showcased an inverted pendulum, a computer operated device that balances a pendulum upside-down. It was pretty cool; the only method it has to balance it is using a motor to move a cart back and forth along a horizontal track, much like how an inkjet printer works, only a huge amount more precise. Its interesting, if you knock the pendulum off balance or spin it around, the cart spans back and forth, constantly adjusting until its back up, balanced again. Its so precise in fact, that it never stopped moving while we were in the room. The professor that was displaying it said that sometimes when he was in the room alone with the door closed, the pendulum would come to a point where it wasnt moving at all, but then the only thing he had to do was blowing softly at it from across the room to knock it ever so slightly off balance and start it back up again.  After that we toured the spatial design / rapid prototyping labs and finally went outside to check out the  mini baja car  that four graduates had built for their senior project and had entered into a national competition and won first place with. Finally, past 5:00 everyone got back into the bus and headed back to the Double Tree. Once we got back, we perused around the expo for a while. A lot of northwestern engineering colleges were there: OSU (go Beaves!), OIT, PSU, and many others. I talked to someone at length about an experiment involving micro-gravity that was going to taken up to be studied by way of NASA. (We saw this and head a bit about it back at PSU too). Oh, PSU currently has two other student experiments being tested on the international space station.  AT and David knew ahead of time who their hosts were, so they sat with them for the banquet, but the rest of us didnt know we needed to know beforehand, so we got adopted into another group (all but Zoo, who went with David). One of the engineers whom we were sitting with does accident reconstruction and a TON of other things. He makes about $250 an hour doing reconstruction work. o.O The other one was an engineer at Freightliner who told us some interesting storied about test-driving though Minnesota (I think) earlier this year to catch the -20 degree weather.   Dinner was good, but not as good as the to-die-for potatoes and steak at last weeks banquet (or at least thats what Lenny said). After dinner they introduced the head table and started into the presentations, most of which were about renewable energy etc. The last one was incredibly boring for the first half hour, but then the speaker played a sweet movie about an array of 80 staggeringly  huge  windmills (Im talking 300 tall towers, 240 diameter blade radius) off the coast of Norway (I think...).   Anyway, once that was over, it was getting close to 9:20 and we needed to leave, so by use of ASL, we all communicated to each other across the banquet hall that we were all thinking the same thing and made a hasty exit while they were answering question. (I feel bad, in our rush to get out quickly, Lenny, Tyler and I forgot to thank / say goodbye to our host.)   Holy crap, the drive home was CRAZY. First, it was raining like never before and the vast majority of the time I couldnt see any type of lane makings. Second, everyone was making massive amounts of noise, and third, my brakes werent working properly (Im getting them replaced tomorrow... *checks his watch* make that later today.) Once we hit Canyon road again, we started blasting techno and everyone in the backseat lost their sanity. I wish I had a video camera with me AT was making up his own beats and random odd sounds, Tyler was trying to rock the car with his erratic motions and Zoo started screaming and doing other things. ... Yeah that was prolly the best part of the trip. :)  Once I dropped everyone off at their cars at the high school (at 10:10) I came home (carefully, bad brakes remember?) and here I am now, typing this.

      Listening to:  Verve - Bittersweet Symphony ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers - Breaking the Girl ,  Jimmy Eat World - If You Don't, Don't  Talking to: Olivia  I have many topics to cover in this post, and I got something like 1 hours of sleep last night... on my floor, so forgive me if portions don't make much sense.  With that preclude, I'll start with a run-by-run of yesterday and today. After I finished school ( an hour after my last post) I took Melissa home and headed home myself, intent on swiftly cleaning my room and getting ready for that night. In reality, I got sidetracked, and didn't really start cleaning my room until almost two hours later. Close to 3:00 I started removing some stuff from my old car that I wanted to keep so that my dad could get rid of it later that day (it never actually happened, he's now debating doing something else with it). Anyway, that took a while and then I had to go back inside and mess with my annoying DHCP server to get the office computer (and then later Penguin, my Linux box) back on the net. My mom suddenly came in and informed me that I had under half-an-hour until the Beaverton Florist closed, so I got in the car and made my way over the get the corsage. On my way back I was going to stop at Blockbuster on Nimbus and rent the Hudsucker Proxy for the after-party, but at the intersection before it I realized that it would take me an extra 10 minutes minimum to get it, adding in traffic time, so I turned around and headed back home. Before I got in the shower I called Andrew and told him that I would be picking him up at 5:45 instead of 5:30 like originally planned (since it was like, 5:20 right then and I wasn't even home yet. I got home, jumped in the shower, grabbed the fastest car and flew over to his house... then we took like 20 minutes to get back out the door again. I got back to my house at 6:20 (Cam and Kelli got there at 6:10), ran around the house simultaneously changing into my suit, finding invitations and directions and eating a quick snack. Then we all got in the van and went to Adri's house where we picked her and Melissa up, but not without first stopping for pictures etc.   By this time it was about 7:00, and after some minor confusion about names of highways (it's highway 26 to I217 to the 405 to I5, no wait, it's I217 to highway 26 to, no wait...) we were on our way. Once we got downtown, we passed a parking structure and I was thinking about turning in, but then I decided that it would be safe to keep going and see if it was actually the Hilton the next block (I thought it was, but I wasn't sure). Then we got stuck in the valet parking line (which we should have used... it was $6, not upwards of $30 like we'd been told before. finally I got sick of waiting behind parked (literally) cars and cut into the bus lane momentarily. After that we circled around and ended up parking the place that I was going to park in to begin with, but didn't (lol). Oh, I can't go on without mention the weird on a streetcorner a few blocks from the Hilton, we were stopped at a stoplight and all just kinda watching him... he had stopped a couple in the middle of the sidewalk and kept getting in their way as they tried to pass. We couldn't hear what he was saying, but judging by his elaborate gestures and body movements, he was trying to ask them form something. Then as the light turned green and we drove through the interestection, he randomly ran over the the nearest wall and did a backflip off it. The couple took this opportunity to head off the other direction. (lol)  We got in and checked the time... 7:25 - amazing considering traffic and all the other delays. Exploring we went... looking for ways took kill the half-hour+ until the doors opened. We discovered the 23rd floor has a sweet viewing area, and a couple other people (Emily, Rachael T and others) discovered that there was some type of high class ball in the ballrooms (by crashing it... well, just taking the elevators down and walking through the middle of it, but they called it crashing it :) ). Turned out that we were in the first 10 or so people to arrive.   The doors finally opened at I-don't-know-when and we got out raffle tickets etc. and went in. It was really nice, all elegant and stuff, and a 12 (I think...) person jazz band played. We spent the next almost-2 hours sitting, taking pictures, eating and really really wanting to dance. Oh, in regards to dancing, our school's faculty (um, no, just our Principle ... the teacher wanted to dance too) won't allow it because we "have to be allowing of all denominations" or something... I wondering what group of people outside of the Amish still consider dancing something to be looked down on... It's sooo stupid. /tangent    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Once we were done sitting, we... stood. and stood some more. Actually we all went perusing the hotel some more and got our official pictures taken. Close to 11:15, my mom arrived from her concert at *I'll ask her where she was playing, later*.     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      After some confusing about who was taking which car, taking Josh, picking up Steven and getting the movie, my mom left in my car (which she had driven, so knew where it was parked) with Cam, Kelli and Andrew and I left (in her van again, blasting Country music) with Adri, Josh and Melissa. While they were getting the movie, we picked up Steven and we all convened at my house at 11:45. Andrew went downstairs and obsessed with Ninja Guiden and the rest of us started watching the Hudsucker Proxy. Cam and Kelli had to leave at 12-something and Josh left a bit afterward. Andrew came up eventually and finished watching the movie with us. Then, after waking Adri up (lol), Steven, Andrew and I took Adri and Melissa back to Adri's house (at 1:30). I'm not sure of exact times but I thing I fell asleep on my floor at 4:00, woke up again at just before 5, removed my contacts, and drifted in and out of sleep until 9 or 10.   After breakfast, I took Andrew home then went to an eye doctor appointment (with Steven still with me), came back home, made a tiny pizza, took Steven home, and here I am now, typing this.   ____________________________________________________   I approached the thought of the banquette with the idea that the best way to get through it happily was to ignore (i.e. to not think about; pay attention to, not shunning or something) Gwen and Richard, but that had already become impossible before we had even entered the building. Get this: Without my ever having seen his car before, out of all the 1000+ parking spaces in all the garages and all the streets around the Hilton, I managed to park  right beside  them. Heck, if the elevators weren't so small, we'd have prolly taken the same one down. And then I managed to pick one of the one tables directly behind then so any time I looked up at the band (or speakers etc.) I was looking right at them. I realized when I got home that they're also in the background of quite a few of my pictures. Grrr... I just can't get away from it. *feels like... *realizes that he can't 'feel'** Mixed emotions bring me sorrow, to put it lightly.   ____________________________________________________   School is troubling me... It's looking like I'm going to have to scrap my SOS Spanish class 'cause it's getting increasingly difficult to work with (stupid things like giving me a picture of a hideous woman and asking if i think she's beautiful (granted, in Spanish) I answer no and it grades me wrong... and how on earth are you supposed to tell someone's eye color when you can barely tell the color of their hair?? (Yeah I got both of those wrong too). I'm still wondering whether or not I'll be able to go to Vegas too... Even if Char says yes, I'm wondering if it's a good idea to skip an entire week of school.    ____________________________________________________   My family situation's still quite messed up too. Twice in one week has my dad absolutely blown up at my mom again, and once again have the police visited our house. Oh, and now it seems that he finally wants to leave his church because he's fed up with their continued harrassment of my mom (er... go figure...), but he's under the oppinion that he can arbitrarily decided on a new church home and that my mom will want to follow him to it. It's looking a bit more like he's going to give her new one a chance, but I'm not sure. LOL at this point our five person family is divided amoung four different church bodies.  I have a headache... I want wine. (LOL)

      Last week I spent the night at Cam's house... we mostly just sat around, built a huge fire, put it out (LOL), and watched 8 Mile (... still trying to find the plot... there's got to be one...).  Yesterday Bwitty stopped by - lol I didn't reconize her for a second. We talked for five minutes or so and I invited her to my after-party tonight (which I don't really think will be much of a party at all, but oh well.)  Speaking of tonight, tonight's finally WINTER BANQUETTE!! *yay* That should be interesting. I'm picking up Andrew at 5:30, Cam and Kelli are getting to my house at 6:00 and we're picking up Adri and Melissa at 6:15ish. The banquette starts at 8:00 and we'll prolly be ready to head out at 10:00, though actually it might be much later than that... I invited Steven to come over afterward if he wants... have no idea when 'afterward' will be though. The girls have to clear out at 12:30 (which also means Cam since he's going with Kelli) and *... thinks* Andrew, Josh and Steven might stay over night.  I'm getting out of school at 11:30 :) that's a plus right there too.

      Man, I'm having trouble finding time to sit down and get my linux box and affiliated webpage, email, etc. up and running. Heck, I'm having trouble finding time to do anything lately... I need to buckle down and get like, a week's worth of schoolwork done ahead of time too, before the 26th when I'm *hopefully* going to Vegas with Cam and Andrew for 10 days. ... That will be soooo fun if only it would work... My parents are fine with it, but Cam's sister Char (whose house we're going to be staying in, and whose kid Cam's going to be babysitting while we're there) is acting badly about it. I'm kinda confused cause she's fine with another person coming with Cam (Andrew already got the ticket like, two weeks ago), but she seems to be baulking at two people. Kinda annoying since I thought up the idea in the first place. (lol) Whatever...  Winter Banquette's this week... I wonder how that will go... I think I'm having a small party at my house afterward. (Well, I know I am having a party, the only thing about it that I don't know is how 'small' it'll be.

      I went and visited my mom's church,  Beaverton Christian Church  this morning. Last month they handed out 17  thousand  dollars in $10 bills, one to every person in the building. It was a parody of the parable of the talents, everyone was supposed to invest the ten dollars in whatever way they could think of and then turn in the proceeds in three weeks (last week). All the money gained on top of the $17,000 would go to help AIDs victims in Africa. People were very creative, ideas carried out ranged from selling flowers on freeway onramps to opening a sushi bar at school to making collector's mailboxes out of model trains. As of the final count yesterday, they had received $39,395 back, and there's much more coming in. I'm thinking that I might start attending BCC on a regular basis; I'll pray about it and see where God leads...  Oh, btw, this church is by no means small... they can fit more people on their  stage  than Calvary has ever had in their entire auditorium... (LOL)

      You may have noticed that for the last day and a half or so, I've been using  Sideblog  and like it for what it is, which isn't much... There's almost no perceivable user support base, and the free version only allows you to post five posts with no archiving, worse, without informing you, it deletes the oldest post to make way for the newest. Because of this, I lost 7 links without realizing it. Here are the ones left and I'm removing my Sideblog account:   The largest diamond ever discovered  (10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 carats)  Just in time for Valentine's day:  'The science of love'  (Are we "literally addicted to love" or is that just the prairie voles?)

      I can't believe I forgot to write about this yesterday (lol). We had a sex chapel (let's guess... yup) yesterday, and *will insert name when I remember it* from *will insert name of ministry when I remember it* came and spoke. It was ... yeah it just "was" LOL close to the end of the hour and a half, he asked us several questions along the lines on "Show of hands, who here wants to have great sex eventually" or, "Who wants to have sex lots?" LOL it was sooooo funny watching people kinda start to put their hand up then stop, then hold it up again... Don't worry, the entire thing was from a biblical standpoint (um, duh, it's a Christian school...) and it was all geared toward waiting to get married and stuff. ...But it was pretty funny :)

      Well today was good I think... I'm not a very accurate judge anymore. School got out at 1:30 so all the student body and faculty were free to attend a Funeral for Brandon's (a senior) mom. It was really neat, his dad's one of the worship leaders at Harvest (their church), and led worship for the service.  Brandon got up and spoke for a bit; it's amazing how well he's taking it all. He's much stronger than, well, almost anyone I know'd be in his situation.  Afterward, several seniors and I went out to Red Robin for linner ... or dunch... (Why isn't there a word for lunch/dinner, but there's brunch?) They're such a great group of people... wish I could spend more time with them.

      This was given to me by someone who wants to keep his anonymity:   A preacher wanted to raise money for his church and on being told that there was a fortune in horse-racing, decided to purchase one and enter it in the races. However, at the local auction, the going price for a horse was so high that he ended up buying a donkey instead. He figured that since he had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races. To his surprise, the donkey came in third! The next day, the local paper carried this headline: PREACHER'S ASS SHOWS  The preacher was so pleased with the donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won. The paper read: PREACHER'S ASS OUT IN FRONT  The bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity that he ordered the preacher not to enter the donkey in another race. The paper headlines read: BISHOP SCRATCHES PREACHER'S ASS  This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the preacher to get rid of the donkey. The preacher decided to give it to a nun in a nearby convent. The paper headline the next day read: NUN HAS BEST ASS IN TOWN.  The bishop fainted. He informed the nun that she would have to get rid of the donkey, so she sold it to a farmer for ten dollars. The next day the paper read: NUN SELLS ASS FOR $10.00  This was too much for the bishop, so he ordered the nun to buy back the donkey and lead it to the plains where it could run wild. The next day the headlines read: NUN ANNOUNCES HER ASS IS WILD AND FREE.  The bishop was buried the next day.

      Listening to:  Joe Satriani - Summer Song  Thinking: How times have changed...  I remember probably the happiest period of time in my life - the start of my 6th grade year and my all the new things it brought. I was so happy my first day of youth group (well, actually I as several other would be 6th graders had been attending for some time, but this was the first day we met at the then-new building, TVJA, and the first time I was technically part of the group. As time went on, I started developing my little nitch there - my friends (of whom Goody was my best), my role (sound guy)... and everything just fit together so happily. Life was pretty much care free back then, sure I had all the issues at home, in some ways better in many ways worse than now, but I didn't pay attention to them, they were just an annoyance that was gradually, without my seeing it, wearing me down.   Now though, everything's different, the only place I feel like I truly belong anymore is school, and not even so much there anymore... now that I'm like a 1.2 GPA student with a learning disability that seems to get me into trouble a lot. My core group of friends has changed to Cameran, Andrew, Steven, d'Dee (lol), Kristy, and assorted others. I've been through a short lived romantic relationship that has its definite plusses and minuses... I go to school again. (LOL, um yeah, I was home schooled for most of my life) I have a car, the lingering need to get a job, all the cares and worries of a teenager (plus some that hopefully the vast majority of us don't have to face), and I'm just generally having trouble coping with life. I have a rather irrational emotional complex that can change on a dime, but never allow me to show it.   I think really the first thing that needs changing to get my out of this rut of depression that I keep falling back into again is a spirit of thankfulness and trust that God is good and looking out for me even when I can't see it. This is tough however, when at times I'm finding myself doubting the very basis of faith that my hope rests on... Does God really exist? Is this all just something we make up to help us get through life, or is it real? These are questions that I struggle with fairly frequently and I really (no matter what it appears on the outside) don't think I've ever answered myself.  Pray for me will yah' guys? I need it, I really have no idea where my life's going right now and it scares me.

      I just ran across an interesting blog called  Hot Abercrombie Chick!  ... um... yeah, despite the name, it belongs to a college freshman (girl), a "probable" philosophy major. In her Feb. 3rd post she has an overview of the whole pro life / choice issue from what seems to be an unbiased standpoint. I haven't read much of her stuff (indeed, not even all of the abortion write up), but what I've seen I like. Most of the people that comment on her site are far left liberals, but I like some of what she herself has to say. Go check it out and tell me what you think.

       The Farewell Dossier  (the world's largest non-nuclear explosion ever to be seen from space was caused by a software trojan)  I copied the article incase anyone reading this doesn't have a  New York Times  subscription   By WILLIAM SAFIRE Published: February 2, 2004  Wahington Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of "the Farewell dossier": how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia  all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss  helped us win the cold war.  Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president  dtente notwithstanding  to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the U.S.S.R.  Seven years later, we learned how the K.G.B. responded. I was writing a series of hard-line columns denouncing the financial backing being given Moscow by Germany and Britain for a major natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy supplies to the Communists, as well as generate $8 billion a year to support Soviet computer and satellite research.  President Franois Mitterrand of France also opposed the gas pipeline. He took President Reagan aside at a conference in Ottawa on July 19, 1981, to reveal that France had recruited a key K.G.B. officer in Moscow Center.   Col. Vladimir Vetrov provided what French intelligence called the Farewell dossier. It contained documents from the K.G.B. Technology Directorate showing how the Soviets were systematically stealing  or secretly buying through third parties  the radar, machine tools and semiconductors to keep the Russians nearly competitive with U.S. military-industrial strength through the 70's. In effect, the U.S. was in an arms race with itself.  Reagan passed this on to William J. Casey, his director of central intelligence, now remembered only for the Iran-contra fiasco. Casey called in Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration in the U.S. and Japan, Weiss counseled against deportation.   Instead, according to Reed  a former Air Force secretary whose fascinating cold war book, "At the Abyss," will be published by Random House next month  Weiss said: "Why not help the Soviets with their shopping? Now that we know what they want, we can help them get it." The catch: computer chips would be designed to pass Soviet quality tests and then to fail in operation.   In our complex disinformation scheme, deliberately flawed designs for stealth technology and space defense sent Russian scientists down paths that wasted time and money.   The technology topping the Soviets' wish list was for computer control systems to automate the operation of the new trans-Siberian gas pipeline. When we turned down their overt purchase order, the K.G.B. sent a covert agent into a Canadian company to steal the software; tipped off by Farewell, we added what geeks call a "Trojan Horse" to the pirated product.   "The pipeline software that was to run the pumps, turbines and valves was programmed to go haywire," writes Reed, "to reset pump speeds and valve settings to produce pressures far beyond those acceptable to the pipeline joints and welds. The result was the most monumental non-nuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space."   Our Norad monitors feared a nuclear detonation, but satellites that would have picked up its electromagnetic pulse were silent. That mystified many in the White House, but "Gus Weiss came down the hall to tell his fellow NSC staffers not to worry. It took him another twenty years to tell me why."   Farewell stayed secret because the blast in June 1982, estimated at three kilotons, took place in the Siberian wilderness, with no casualties known. Nor was the red-faced K.G.B. about to complain publicly about being tricked by bogus technology. But all the software it had stolen for years was suddenly suspect, which stopped or delayed the work of thousands of worried Russian technicians and scientists.   Vetrov was caught and executed in 1983. A year later, Bill Casey ordered the K.G.B. collection network rolled up, closing the Farewell dossier. Gus Weiss died from a fall a few months ago. Now is a time to remember that sometimes our spooks get it right in a big way.

      In computers and the Internet, a geek is a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with technology to the point of sometimes not appearing to be normal. As computer technology becomes less frightening to larger numbers of people, society seems to be developing a more tolerant, even benevolent view of the geek. In some circles, it is considered a compliment to be called a geek because the term implies a high level of capability with technology. The term  hacker  used to connote competence more strongly than the term geek, but since media almost always uses the term hacker to mean someone who attempts to break into computer systems (see  cracker ), geek has become a more desirable label. Historically, a geek was a circus person in the sideshow who performed some bizarre feat.   this article was found  here

      02/02/2004 23:05.43 Inferno0777: presently   adv.   In a short time; soon: She will arrive presently.    Usage Problem. At this time or period; now: He is presently staying with us.    Archaic. At once; immediately.    Usage Note: An original meaning of presently was at the present time; currently. That sense is said to have disappeared from the literary language in the 17th century, but it has survived in popular usage and is widely found nowadays in literate speech and writing. Still, there is a lingering prejudice against this use. The sentence General Walters is... presently the United States Ambassador to the United Nations was acceptable to only 50 percent of the Usage Panel in the late 1980s.    02/02/2004 23:05.43 *** Auto-response sent to Inferno0777: I'm currently rather engrosed in homework... will be back presently, but I seem to have no idea what presently means... 02/02/2004 23:06.11 Inferno0777: Hope that helps

      Music mood:  the Ataris - In This Diary   When I woke up this morning I was so full of emotion... I wanted to write pages to this blog, but now all that's left of my thoughts are a few scattered memories.   School seems so bittersweet now... It's like I don't care at all about grades anymore, prolly because I feel helpless and incompetent. I'll never be good enough, I'll never be good enough. - Thats what I keep telling myself about both my schoolwork and pathetic, lovesick musings. Truth is though, with the new ADD / Dyslexia program that I'm on and support from my parents and most of my teachers, I probably can overcome the schoolwork issues and pull my GPA up from something like 1.1 now to at least a 3.0. Even after that though, the other problem still remains and in truth, for that I really don't think I'll ever be good enough.  Why oh why does this world have to be so cruel? Why do I have to keep torturing myself with all these emotional politics?  Holy crap, I need Cameran there at the banquette with me so I'll have a little support to fall back on... Hope he can come.

      btw, an update on my living conditions at home... I have successfully retrieved the charger for my cell, but I'm keeping it off most of the time so my parents aren't suspisious. I've also completely circumvented the lock on the office door, and have gotten the serial numbers of the keys for both locks so I'll be able to make copies whenever I need to. I've left myself a route of access into my supposedly locked room though I may or may not need to use it as I've convinced my parentals to allow my computer outside of the room, though it remains un-networked, and as such, not connected to the web. I have a plan for circumventing that too, two plans actually, both of which are already starting to go into affect. All I really need right now is a bit of luck and a half hour with the house to myself. I also still have keys to every car except my mom's new one even though my mom thinks I don't have any of them.

      Well, today was interesting... NOT! Nothing happened at all... 'cept for my mom getting mad at my sister for taking a walk with her friend Nicky. They couldn't find her to ask her, so they told me to tell mom where they were if I saw her, which I did when she asked several minutes after they left. When I told her she went to the front door and started yelling my sister's name out it really loudly. Annoyed, she came back inside (they were out of earshot) and when they got home no more than ten mintues later, she pulled my sister downstairs to talk to her,  and when they got done talking, my mom left to a recital (or something) and dragged Nicky along with her to it. I have no idea what that was about... not sure how she has the right to punish SOMEONE ELSE'S CHILD... But hey, I wouldn't be one to understand my mom. (LOL)   Mi madre es loco.

      Yesterday, the long version...   I snuck out of the house around noon and Adri and Steven came and picked me up. We stopped for gas and Adri's mom called (file that information away for later) and then were on our way again. We got to Becky's house a bit afterward (prolly something like 1:00), stayed there for a while, then got a ride to the closest MAX station. We rode that to the zoo, but there Adri's mom called and got mad at her for not calling and telling her when we were leaving Becky's house. Because of this, Adri's mom came and picked her up (go  here  to read Adri's oppinion about that - lol). My mom had gotten home before this, discovered I was gone, and had begun a day-long endevor to call as many people as possible and trash-talk me as much as possible in hopes that it would bring me home faster (F*** you, mom...) Anyway, she had gotten around to Adri's mom, and Adri's mom had kindly offered me a ride home, but I refused it saying that I hadn't come this far just to go back home when my mom told me to (...again).   Anyway, long story short, Becky, Steven and I had a great time at the zoo, though it was close to closing time and I don't think we saw  every single  exibit, but yeah, we had a great time. Afterward, we went further downtown (without paying MAX fare since we were only three stops from Fareless Square - o.O) and ate linner / dunch at Pioneer Place.  We finally headed back to Hillsboro on the MAx and arrived at the end of the line around 7:00. Becky's dad came to pick us up, but informed me that my mom had called and instructed him not to, under any circumstances, give me a ride anywere... That was odd, but whatever. Yeah... anyway, Steven and I just ran the -1 miles to another MAX stop, got on, went to the Fair Grounds, got off, ran another 1000+ feet and met up with them at the Burgerville (lol... I'm still not sure why we went there... oh well, whatever). Anyway, we said goodbye to them and decided to head back. On the way back to Beaverton Transit on the MAX, two random college girls came up to us and started majorly hitting on us... The conversation went something like this:  Them: So, what'cha doing later tonight? Us: Um... going home... Them: Aw come on, it's Saturday night, night before break, let's go have some fun! Us: Um... all last week has been break. Them: Yeah, wait, wha...? how old are you? Us: 17... Them: Serious, no way! (to eachother: ooo, ooo, jail babe!) *We kinda just look at eachother right about now, wonder when they're going to go away* Them: (to eachother again: Well, they're kinda cute anyhow)  This kept going on for a bit, but you get the gist of it...  When we finally got to Beaverton Transit, we boarded a bus heading for my house, had an interesting discussion about the controversial restraunt  Hoooters  with a complete stranger, and finally arrived at the bus stop just over a mile from my house. Steven called him mom, who came and picked him up once we got to my door, and I went inside and greeted... my sisters. Turns out that my mom was gone to a bridal shower and my dad was gone to... something or other else.  Anyway, once my mom and dad both got home, they sat me down and mom listed her punishments for me (My dad had no punishments because in his view, I really didn't do much wrong... just needed some time to get away for a while.)  Punishments are as follows: 1. The doors to my bedroom and the office have locks installed on them, I am not allowed access to them for two weeks, which, in theory, negates the possibility of internet usage. 2. I am not allowed to drive for two weeks, though mom did return my car itself. 3. No activities whatsoever outside of school (this includes extra Calculus help after school...)

      Well, I'm royaly screwed... Long story short, I snuck out of the house today with Steven and Adri and went to Becky's house then the zoo.   My parents changed the locks on my room and the office so I can't use a computer or do anything else normal. They're gone right now and I have no idea what else they have in store for me...  I'll prolly not be posting for a while outside of school, so, as KT says, tootles.  Oh, btw Mandy, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I wasn't even thinking about prom and all that when all this happened... This was all just too spur-of-the-moment. I probably killed our plans about going, and again, I'm really sorry.

      Crap, my mom is being a huge b*tch. Tomorrow I'm spending the day on the town, going to the zoo among other things with Becky, Mandy, Adri and Steven. This is all well and good except for a counseling appointment that my mom had made a while back (without telling me) for 4:00 tomorrow. When she brought it to my attention, I immediately knew that it was going to need to cancel it since it simply would not fit into the schedule for tomorrow, but when I asked her to do it (since she made the appointment herself) she wouldn't hear of it. So, I did the responsible thing and called my counselor and canceled the appointment myself. We were both fine with it but... about half an hour ago, mom asked me if I'd skewed my schedule to make room for the appointment yet, and I was about to lie to her just to get out of having to explain it all over to her, but I didn't and told her that I'd canceled it myself. She was furious and decided to punish me by giving me FOUR F***ING HOURS OF HOMEWORK to do before I go tomorrow morning... AFTER SHE SAID THAT NO MATTER WHAT, I WOULD GET ALL DAY OFF TOMORROW!  Oh my gosh, she's sooo....  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!.....  *restrains himself from blowing up or shooting something*  But wait, there's more... She originally wanted me to meet her at Costco tomorrow morning at 10 to pick up my glasses then go with her to the library to get some books for my English term paper (why she has to be there for me to do that, I don't know...), but then we decided that I would just park my car at the grocery store across from Steven's house so we wouldn't have to take both vehicles all over... I'm realizing that that's a very bad thing now because she's now going to try to check my work to make sure it's done, and won't let me go if it's not...  As I said to Steven moments ago: "well, one way I get literally no sleep, another way we start out at like, 3pm instead of 11am (and Adri has to be back home by 5), and another way, the day goes fine, 'cept for my parents harassing me by calling me constantly, and I wouldn't but it past them to come to the zoo since they already know I'm going to be there... then life'll be hell for a while at home... LOL Screw my mom and her stupid control issues."

      If you don't already have this song, get it. I love it, it's beautiful.    Incubus - I Miss You    To see you when I wake up, is a gift I didn't think could be real. To know that you feel the same, as I do, is a Three-fold utopian dream. You do something to me  That I can't explain.  So would I be out of line, if I said  I miss you? I see your picture; I smell your skin on, the empty pillow next to mine. You have only been gone ten days, but already I am wasting away. I know I'll see you again  Whether far or soon. But I need you to know, that I care  And I miss you.

Update (Thursday, March 25th): I just recieved a voicemail from her from last night saying they're keeping Rascal a bit longer.  *happyness* :)

      Ok, about last week... *goes back and finally edits the Sunday March 14, 9:06:05 AM post*  Concerning the last three days:  *after typing this, he got a call that the salmon that his dad's been BBQing was ready, so he ran upstairs, ate it, and came back down to finish this*  Friday was like any other day really except that we were on EOD (End Of Day) schedule for a talent show.  The talent show lineup (as best can be remembered by Armaan): 1. Josh R playing piano 2. Alex sticking his hand in his mouth, putting both legs behind his head, making himself sneeze with a Q-tip  up his nose  and licking his elbow (holy crap) 3. Carissa (spl?) playing piano 4. Megan, Patrick and Brandon playing / singing *doesn't remember* 5. Jen, Gwen and Adri singing  Into the West by Annie Lennox  (all looking cute and sounding wonderful, I might add) 6. Derek and Joel tearing up the stage with a sweet sweet sweet bass / drum duet (they are so friggin' good) 8. Megan and Ali singing  Goodbye to You by Michelle Branch  9. Andrew and David singing an ode to the word "sick"  After this, I said goodbye to everyone for spring break and went back home to collect my computer etc. to set up at Jon-Mark's house for the big all-night LAN party. Now that party was fun... total geeks hanging around each other, having a good time. In attendance were Jon-Mark, Deren (duh and duh), Ryan, Ryan, Brian, Zoo, *someone else that had to leave early, and consequently, I didn't catch his name* and myself. StarCraft all around... I brought food... Wired, Henry Winehard's Cream Soda, chips, and  3 pounds  of Reese's Pieces (lol) Man, we need to have another of those really soon, I wanna hang around those guys more often... so funny :) LOL, One of the Ryans can bend so far backward that he can remove his glasses with his feet! It's great.   I took some video with my camera... will put it up on the web as soon as I pull it off... I'll prolly pull some pics off it too... Speaking of pics, I have a background changer that changes my background picture every so often, and it happened to be on this really cute picture of Gwen and Danie from the banquette. One of the guys saw it and was like "Oh my gosh, they're hot" so I turned off the background changer and it's still my desktop right now (LOL)  Zoo is soo crazy at Starcraft... he creamed every single one of us even when the remaining four (after several had been annihilated) allied and worked against him.  LOLOL We actually had so much load on the lines that we killed the power to most of the lower floor of his house around 10am Sat... We never did figure out what the problem was though we're thinking it might be a GFI somewhere that we couldn't find. Hope they get that fixed.  Anyway, I finally left at 12:40 on Saturday and Steven & Becky called me as soon as I got in the car... Looking back on that I'm quite glad they did... kept me from falling asleep on the way home. LOL, I wonder how that conversation went... I was so tired I don't remember any of it, and I doubt I made much sense to them either. :)  Later that night, after I got 3 or so hours of sleep, I picked up Steven, drove Beaverton Transit Station and we took the MAX out to Portland where the Columbia Symphony was having a concert. There were only two pieces, a symphony and a masse, but they were each about an hour long. I don't get how my mom can play for two hours straight... Id' get so tired (lol). The masse was cool. Aside from the orchestra, it involved a 200 person (it looked like that many, maybe I'm remembering wrong...) choir, four soloists, and the pipe organ in the sanctuary that it was performed in (which is actually two pipe organs, one on the back wall, and one on the front).  Afterward, we all went to a really nice bar for a while that a lot of the orchestra members go to afterwards and finally succeeded in getting a hold of Becky (wed been trying to call her but the line was busy, then we got on aim from my phone but she wasnt on, so we just waited and called a couple more times). We left and went back to my car because the restaurant section of the bar was too expensive (go figure). After driving around for another hour trying to find some place that was open (it was past 11), Steven and I went to a local Sherris and had dinner.   After I took him back home and got back home myself, I tried to get to bed and get to sleep but I was too restless to do so I finally got to sleep after 7am (LOL) and woke up today at 5:30pm (wow, my body clock is going to be messed up because of all this) and Im meeting my uncle to do something tomorrow at 10am so I need to get to bed at a decent time tonight erk

      I'm sure everything's heading downhill from here, but at the moment I feel quite good. Maybe it's cause I'm all warm and comfy in a bathrode - Wikiki day at school so I'm wearing swim trunks, a hawaii shirt, sandals and a towel. Understandably, I'm bringing a change of clothes though since it's predicted that it'll be cloudy and cold all day. Whatever...  My hand's starting to heal up... I drove myself yesterday. Speaking of driving, it's funny how many people from school I meet on the road on the way to school... at the intersection of 229th and TV highway yesterday, Gwen and her dad were the first stopped (in his spiffy new X5), then Rachael Z. and her mom, then me, then Brent freezing his butt off cause his mom had said that it would be a nice day... He took that to mean that the morning would be nice too so he lowered the top on his Wrangler (lol).

      I have a  massive  headache and my hand and srm still hurt... life sux, though today's comfortable day at school so i'm wearing a soft jogging suit and bathrobe. That sorta helps cheer life up. O, and I drove my car home from Melissa's house yesterday after helping her and Danie with a movie for spanish. ...That was a mistake. Er, no, not helping them, driving... My hand was all messed up again afterward, so today I got a ride with Adri. May be a couple days yet before I can drive again.

      Hey I did finally end up going to Melissa and YoungHee's party, but while there I had an encounter with a rose bush that left my right arm / hand useless for the time being. Because of this I'm not going to write the long and envolved post about it that I was going to, but'll save it for later.   Wow, I type so much slower with just my left hand (LOL)  *added Sunday March 21st*  Yeah about that party... I did more schoolwork in the 24 hours before it that I'd ever thought possible because my mom wouldn't let me go unless a certain amount of back work was done. ...That was crazy... well, so was how much I drove in the hour before the party: It started at three and I left the house at 1:55... 'Drove to the Beaverton/Tigard border, bought gifts, drove to Steven's house a bit deeper into Beaverton, drove all the way around inot greater Beaverton (Farmington area and such) to avoid a huge traffic jam that I'd seen before... drove  all  the way into Hillsboro to pick up Cam, stayed a bit the wrap presents and watch part of a movie (?!? lol) then brove back to Aloha to arive at Melissa's house at just after 3:10.  Certain parties whose names I will not mention made the whole thing more of a pain than it already was by continously cracking sick jokes and egging eachother on... That was really annoying. Cam, Melissa, Jen and I finally went outside to get away from it, and finally locked ourselves (minus Jen, I think) in my car. That sorta backfired because the people we were trying to get away from followed us outside but we decided to to protest because now they weren't inside and everyone could go back to watching to movie or whatever it was they were trying to do...  Finally after a while, we succeded in getting just Cam, Melissa, *will insert name of Melissa's friend when I ask Melissa what it is later...* and I in the car by ourselves and drove off for a while.  A bit after that, I turned my car around so the back was facing the basketball hoop and started playing music... That was fun, we just hung out outside doing whatever for a while.  Then, after the sickness had finally died down, I went back inside to watch everyone play Dance Dance Revolution on someone's Playstation2. That was pretty funny.  After all this came my expirience with the rosebush... that was when almost everyone was leaving so I didn't miss out on much because of it (lol) You know, looking back on it from over a week later, I'm realizing that that was the only reason Gwen talked to me that night so I guess I should be thankful for it in some weird was... (LOL)  Speaking of Gwen, let's talk about social networking at the party and such: First and formost, YoungHee's bro. apparently goes to TVJA and from that YoungHee knows Jeff, whom she brought over to do some magic tricks... Now, Cam, Andrew (who wasn't there, but has been at almost every other activity) and I had always been somehow led to believe that Jeff was someone to shy away from and because of such, never relaly talked to him. But now, in the closer envirionment of the party, he seemed like someone interesting to get to know. The second person whom I know almost nothing about is Richard: When we came, Jen, Gwen and Adri were hunkered away in Melissa's room practicing a song that they sang on Friday, so I got a chance to talk to Richard a bit, not long mind you though because the girls got out of the room almost immediately after we got there... From then on, Richard and Gwen were pretty seclusive, mostly cuddling and spending time in rooms apart from where everyone else was... I think that's in part the fault of the two people that were annoying everyone else that I talked about earlier. Oh well, I don't know what to make of it. Sux for me (LOL) but that's life.

      Current mood: sad / depressed / whatever  It doesn't look like I'm going to be able to go to Melissa and YoungHee's party on Sat, and, in consequnece, not going be able to provide rides for Steven and Cam to it. GRRRRRR..... I've got such a mountain of continually backed up schoolwork that keeps gettign added to every day. I can't cope with this... I feel like just taking a break from sanity for a while. Anyone wanna come with me? (lol)  In other news, it's about 2,614 steps from Josh M's front door to my front door. I know this because I was bored, so I ran to his house and back earlier tonight. Took a bit, but was refreshing.  HBOK my life pisses me off... actually, my life depresses me, what pisses me off is my lack of ability to do anything about my life slowly deteriorating before my eyes.

      Well, I'm at school now, so I guess this is 'further notice' (lol). My parents and I met with the very understanding school board last night, who gave me a 20 demerit extention.  In other news, I've collected such a huge amount of detention / suspensioin slips this year that I'm building one or even two REG devices (you all remember what those are, right?) out of them. My Chem. teacher laughed when I told him.

      Listening to:  Kenny G. - Titanic (Instrumental)   Well, I had a good day today... I've been suspended until further notice (which will hopefully be deliberated tonight) for having 100 demerits. My school uses a system of demerits where you get five for a minor offence (every time you get a detention you get a minimum of five demerits). I accumulated a massive amount of detentions to the first semester simply for being tardy because it takes so long to drop off my sister before school. Tardies reset every quarter, and when they do you get two free ones and 4 possibilities to be excused by parents. Every tardy after that is a detention of increasing length and finally at the sixth tardy you get ISS (In-School-Suspension). At the third one you're automatically up for expulsion from the school. Btw, there are two different running tallies of tardies, one for first period and one for all the rest of the periods, so it's different being late for school than being late in between classes.  First semester we (the faculty and I) realized there was a problem when I'd accumulated 16 first-period tardies... that's on top of the ... 10 or so that had been excused. LOL  In any event, I came into this quarter with a ton of demerits and only made that worse by being tardy many times again and by forgetting to serve detentions (an extra detention and 20 demerits). So, yeah... In any event, The school board's holding a special meeting tonight to discuss what to do about me since by our school's bylaws the principle has to recommend to the board, dismissal of anyone that gets 100 demerits. I'm not sure what's going to happen but I do know that the only one who seems outright against me is the principle... everyone one else has an attitude of 'how can the school help you?'  Whatever... that's what's going on in my life right now.  Oh, I maintain that today was good :) pretty carefree, everyone was gone so I had the entire day to be lazy, sleep in and do some work around the house. ... The first non-stressful day in a good while.

      For the first time in a quite a while, I went to youthgroup tonight. 'Brought Adri with me too. Man, I was so down the whole night... A couple times I was almost crying. I don't know really what it was... No, I take that back, I know exactly what it was... Standing there singing, sitting there listening to the message, I couldn't quite keep my attention on what was happening around me. Mind wandering, thoughts drifting, faded memories coming back again to haunt my mind: I'm starting to think I really don't have a place anymore... Everything at church seems so vague, so foreign now, everything at school seems like wishful memories or weeping past, everything at home seems well, horrible. Everywhere I turn I'm reminded of something I'm trying to let go of, was trying to let go of. Then I begin to retrace my steps and realize that I shouldn't be trying to let go of it at all... Or should I? It's been almost eight months now and I still can't figure it out.  What's best for her?  What's best for me?  ...  God, why can't I just tell her how much I'm in love with her?  *cries himself to sleep*

      I'm pissed at my parents... On Monday my mom had told me to get to bed at 10:30, which I did. I couldn't sleep because I'm not used to trying to that early, and close to 11:45 I got up to get a drink. She arrived home, accused me of disobeying her (what the he... such a huge offence...) and then accused me of lying to her when I tried to convince her otherwise. Whatever... I just went back to bed and forgot about it, but then the next night she was out again, and sometime around 9:50 my dad was like, "Why aren't you in bed?" I just kinda  stared blankly at him and was like "wha...?!?" I learned that apparently as a punishment for not being in bed 'on time' on Monday I was supposed to go to be at the hideous time of 9:30 on Tuesday. My mom thought that my dad had told me and my dad had thought that my mom had. It gets even better though... My stupid stupid mom didn't care that it was infact my dad's fault, she decided to punish me for the 'offence'  again  on Wednesday by making me go to bed again at 9:30.  Now on Wed. I don't normally even get home untill past 6:30 and yesterday, my dad had to run a couple errands so I didn't get home untill past 7. I flat out told her that I wouldn't have enough time no matter how she sliced it and that I was not going to go to bed at 9:30. Oh, by the way, we're having a blood drive today at school and I signed up for it assuming my parents would be perfectly fine with it. I mentioned it to my dad, who didn't care, and again to my mom when I got home, right before I told her that I wasn't going to be able to get to bed on time. She mentioned that she had some concern about me being constantly fatigued and that it might make it worse if I were to give blood, but then had to run out the door to catch a movie with some friends.  I called her sometime after 9:30 to address the concerns that she had because I was getting ready for bed, but she steered the conversation to why I wasn't already in bed, not some health issues she might have with me donating blood. I was really hurt by that because it says to me that she cares more about her rules that she impetuously lays down than for me, her son's health. We ended up in an argument which consisted of me almost pleading with her to hear me out, but finally after she cut me off the umpteenth time and said no, I hung up on her. I know, I know, that was a bad thing to do and I already appologized to her. Regaining my composure in a matter of seconds, I kept from crying and went upstairs to my dad's room and right as I knocked on his door, my mom called him. She started telling him her side of the story and before I could get a word in edge-wise, he started doing to her what she had just before been doing to me: abruptly steering the conversation to another topic and blaming it all on her. He started on his whole partyline about how she was a horrible wife and mother and she should be home helping us kids with homework and such (btw, she pours countless hours into doing stuff like that, he just never takes the time to think through his name-calling, yelling tantrums) Anyway, he ended up hanging up on her too, but for a much different reason than I did.   Now would be a good time to clarify that my family's disfunctional.   Anyway, this morning I talked to my mom for a good twenty minutes about the blood donation thing, and she still is stubbornly sticking to punishing me for something that I didn't do and then wasn't informed that I 'did' by not letting me help save a life. Brilliant mom, just brilliant.

         Pictures will take a long time to load, please be patient     Today was awesome! I'll append this post with a fairly long approximation of the day, but it'll take a bit to write, so sit tight.  In the mean time, pictures have been uploaded to  http://members.lycos.co.uk/ccbyg    Painting etc...   On the way over to the Cornelius Community Baptist, I called Cam who had just woken up and invited him to come with me, but he unfortunately he couldn't. Once I got there, I checked the first room (which will become the worship room, but I didn't know that yet), then had a bit of trouble getting into the second room - one of the doors was locked and the other was blocked closed ... I called Mary who didn't answer then it dawned on me to knock. (lol) I did, the door opened and in the room painting were Mary, Jamie, Danie, Jon, Lenny and Alex.  Right after I got there, we switched back to the other room because we'd ran out of red paint for the moment and Over the next hour or so I learned why we were getting the rooms ready to be used - Mary and Lenny have basically taken it upon themselves to start a youth group. I'm pretty excited about it, we've already gotten a lot of it planned out and we're working on the rest - pretty good for an idea that was though up last week. (lol)  At some point Lenny, Jamie and I went out to get some more red paint and met Melissa coming in as we were leaving to go to Ace Hardware. She had her camera with us and all the pictures I'm going to post were taken by it. Speaking of pictures, a while after we got back, Lenny went out and got pizza, and we took a break to eat and take these pictures: (hover your mouse over all the pictures in the post for title)                             btw, the piece of wood that Lenny's hanging off of in "the Lenny Scale" is a broken tire swing. - This happens to currently be my background.    We went back inside and continued painting. Lenny could have almost been on a first-name basis with the employees of Ace for the number of times he had to go back there, but we finally got the rooms looking perhaps not we had planned, but good anyways. Here are some pics of us painting the to-be Game Room:                                        We were originally going to paint these three sides of this room red and one side light green (color of the other room) and then use the green to make the red a plaid, but we eventually decided to go with that blue for one wall and continue using red for the other three. The last paint trip Lenny took, Ace got the shade of red a bit off, so after we touched up the wall, we realized that we could clearly see the difference between the old red and the new. We decided to use handprints to draw attention away from the errors on the wall and it worked out quite nicely. The last picture here is the Worship Room and some stuff that's been donated to our fledgling youth group.               After we were finally done for the day, we sorta lounged around while Abby and Jamie washed all the stuff off. Our excuse was that there was only one sink, but in reality, we did do almost as much work as them, cleaning up upstairs, we were just done faster. (lol)               For some reason Abby and Jamie started running around outside, pretending to fight and Lenny ran after snapping pictures. It went on for like ten minutes - was pretty funny.               Once we had locked up, we went back around the front, signed each others already-painted shirts and took a group picture.             We left and went to Izzy's where Mary's dad was treating us to dinner... On the way there Becky called me and I invited her to come to the youth group when we start it. At one point I noticed Lenny's car ahead of me and to the left, signaling and people waving at me from inside. Eventually I figured out that they wanted me to fall into the lane behind then, and puzzled, I did so knowing full well that both out lanes were turning ahead and that the one I was in would have been faster. I was on the phone though and didn't feel like making a mistake and having to turn around if for some reason I was remembering the road wrong. (lol)  Once we got to Izzy's we were pretty loud and obnoxious. (I think anyway - lol) Oh, and we were REALLY slap-happy - made for a strange time.                                   Yeah, that was a really fun day...

      You know, there are words in geekdom, like in any other area that are taken from their original meaning and changed slightly to better facilitate release into the populous.  Words in question: Gigabyte and Hacker  LOL, I have no idea why I'm posting about this, but here goes...  First, gigabyte... having a little background on the root of the word helps to understand the problem: Computers are at the very basic, a huge, huge compilation of switches that can either be on or off, we call this base 2 (because there are only two positions that they can be in) or binary. In binary a 1 is on and a 0 is off. That's how a computer stores information, in a sequence of 1s and 0s. One space that can be occupied by either a 1 or a 0 is called a bit. A sequence of eight of these is called a byte. For reasons I won't go into here, eight just happens to be the 'magic number' of 1s and 0s that we use to communicate a standard sequence of information (like a number or letter... capital A is 01000001 in binary, lowercase a is 01100001).   The problem lies in societies' grasp of numbers, just as ancient societies used base 6 in mathematics (that's where 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour and other things like 360 degrees in a circle came from - all multiples of 6), so does our society use a base 10 system - all our mathematics are rooted in multiples of 10. Not so with binary, which we've already established, is base 2. Everything involving information storage in computers is figured in multiples of 2 - 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc. As computers advance, more and more storage space is needed bigger and bigger numbers are need to describe that larger space... First bit, then byte, which is eight bits, the a Kilobyte, which is 1024 bytes, then a Megabyte, which is 1024 Kilobytes, then Gigabyte, which is 1024 Megabytes. Now, let's stop and think about this for a minute... A Gigabyte is 8 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 bits... that's 8,589,934,592 ones and zeros... pretty impressive huh?  Now again, back to the problem... societies' changing of a word from its orrignal meaning to something that's better understood by the populous. Our culture is based upon everything conforming to us, us sitting back and just letting it all fall into place. Case in point: tech people are starting to realize that the average non-tech person (who I call the layman)  for some reason can't figure out that a standard like Gigabyte  can  mean exaclty 1024 smaller units, not just simply 1000. Because of this, they've adopted to calling 1000 Megabytes a Gigabyte, not 1024. This is apparent in everything from gmail (check the screenshot from the last post) to labels on hard drives. Now in the case of gmail, this doesn't seem that big, superficially it's only a loss of 201326592 bits (translates to 24 Megabytes), but consider the 200 Gigabyte hard drive that one of my friends bought a few months ago... Imagine if the makers had employed this "layman's gigabyte" but instead counted  every  multiple as simply 1000 not 1024... *grabs his calculator*   Now,  8 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 200 = 1717986918400 8 x 1000 x 1000 x 1000 x 200 = 1600000000000  The former subtracted by the latter is 117986918400 bits That divided by 8 is 14748364800 bytes That divided by 1024 is 14402700 kilobytes That divided by 1024 is 14065.13671875 megabyes That divided by 1024 is 13.735485076904296875 gigabytes  So what have we seen here? Societies' stuborn inability to grasp even slightly foreign concepts has cheated my friend out of   over 13 Gigabytes  .  Secondly, the word hacker... *looks at the clock* ... I'll append this post later.

       Saturday: Prom Night   I dont remember what time I actually got out of bed on Sat. but I think it was just past noon. My sister was at an all-nighter with her youth group and got back home around 2, by this time Id already showered and gotten my suit and everything basically ready. My sister needed a ride to my school at 3 for a fair so I took her over and stuck around for a bit to make sure some of her friends were there, then came back home.   I had eaten (my first meal of the day  lol) and gotten ready to go pick up Steven at 4pm, but Mahdi randomly showed up at our door. Now, a little background on Mahdi: We met him at the ethnic excuse-for-a church we attended almost all my life (well, actually we helped start it) until a couple years ago. Hes got some mental issues going on and my dads been trying to help him but Mahdis been getting into a lot of trouble with the police and other people lately. Like a week or so ago he randomly left his van in our driveway, with a brief note written to my dad, stuck on our door that said that his roommate had been giving him trouble. That was all. (Btw, he still has studs on his tires, several weeks after the latest date he can legally have them on.) Yeah, so anyway, he randomly showed up on our doorstep and started knocking on the door for something like six to ten minutes straight. I was the only one home and just ignored him; didnt let him know I was there. I was sitting in the kitchen eating and a thought occurred to me Hes persistent enough; he might come up on the deck. I though for sure that he wouldnt but there still was a possibility, and I needed to do something in my room anyway, so I took my food (leftovers from Wus Open Kitchen) and went down to my room to finish eating it. Almost the second I walked into my room, I heard Mahdi walking up the steps to the second story deck, right where I was moments ago. I called my dad and asked him if hed told Mahdi that he could come over and he told me just the opposite that he had told him specifically  not  to come. Yeah, I waited like twenty minutes and went back upstairs again (with a gun on my belt) and saw that he had gone and taken his van, but he left a 20 thousand dollar silk Persian rug on top of our cathouse outside Yeah whatever, odd fellow.  Anyway, because of this I was close to half an hour late picking up Steven. On the way to Beckys we picked up a camera from Cams house because my dad had mine and I hadnt seen my parents in two days so I couldnt get it from him. (Weird schedules where everyones asleep when I get home and everyones gone when I wake  lol)  We finally arrived at Beckys at 5:30 instead of 5:00 like we had planned, but twas all good cause Danie and Jon arrived just after us too. Mary and Mandy were busy doing Beckys hair so Danie, Jon, Steven, Edwin and I picked prolly the oddest of the  several hundred or so VHSs there  Yomega Yo Zone lol, It was a yo-yo infomercial type thing that we guessed and later confirmed, came with a yo-yo. Then came hanging around waiting for food to cook, eating and changing. (lol) I forgot a belt so I had to borrow one from Beckys mom. After that were couple and group pictures and driving to the random ballroom in Portland: Steven, Becky, Edwin and Mary in Beckys moms car, and Danie, Jon, Mandy and I in Mandys moms.  Once we got there just after it started at 8, one of the first things I noticed was the candy buffet on several huge tables in the first room, there were massive (Im talking like two cubic feet+) bowls of Skittles, M&Ms and other things. When we got to the dance floor we hung back for a bit for some reason and then decided to start right as the slow songs started. (lol) Slow dancing was kinda scary but fun  sorta weird to do it with someone whos just a friend, but yeah, twas fun. Then the at the first fast song, Baby Got Back, Steven and I were like Uh, were not dancing to this which was all good cause our dates picked that moments to run off with each other, so we went back to our table (LOL). The rest of the next hour or two was spent dancing again, but up in the back of the higher of the two-tiered stage. Cotton Eye Joe came on and all 70 or so of us up there started a massive line dance. So great haha. But yeah, I think eventually the six of us in our group that were up there got tired of the ear-shattering loudness and the heat, even though there was an industrial fan blowing on stage (girls randomly lifting their dressed in front of it or maybe by it whatever) and went back to our table. More walking and picture taking for half an hour and then we finally organized everyone and got group and couple shots. The group shot was interesting, the photographer was trying to fit four of us on a really tiny bench, and eventually just had Mandy and Becky sit on Stevens and my leg. Seemed really uncomfortable for the poor girls, they were almost falling off (lol, but the picture turned out good, so *yay*).  Around 11:30, when it officially ended, we all walked outside and waited for the moms to walk back from wherever it was that they were. They ended up needing to use the restroom so we waited some more, and while we were, some self-proclaimed pervert walked up and started asking us to all pose for a picture. (lol) He kept commenting about Beckys hair then after her took the picture some random lady with him started asking us what our addresses were and if we wanted copies of the picture. Were all like Um, you said youre a perv, go away then once the moms got back down we went next door to the parking garage and some random college guys started hitting on the girls and walked around a corner out of sight. When our elevator opened, we realized it was glass and they were hanging around the outside. To bad for them, all the girls dressed were floor-length, though Edwin was going to moon them (LOL)   Sunday: The after-party, Cams house, and hearing Mr. Weber preach   We made it to Sherri's ordered our food, ate, and tried many different inventive ways of asking for the check when we realized that it was past 2am, more than two hours from when wed arrived (LOL) - They were way understaffed. Poor waitress though, she was running around like mad.  When we arrived back at Beckys house, Steven and I went inside and grabbed our stuff and everyone else took off to take other people home.   *sigh* That was a really fun night despite the hotness and cramped-ness of the ballroom. For the record, I think my date (Mandy) looked beautiful and am really happy she invited me.  Side not: I saw a friend Hannah that I hadn't seen in... prolly more than 7 years... she got a picture with me but I forgot to get ond with her... should somehow get in touch with her and have her email it to me or something... Speaking of pictures, I'm prolly going to wait till I have some better pics (prolly scan of other people's and scans of the professional pics) before I post any... I don't have the camera with me and I didn't like the pictures I took.  I spent the next hour or so on the road taking Steven home, going home myself to get a belt (lol) and arriving at Cams house past 3:30am.  The first thing I noticed when I got to Cams house was the silhouette of someone with an AEG automatic weapon aimed out his window at my car, and the second thing I noticed was the automatic weapon firing rounds at my car  with very very good aim (or bad aim, depending on what he was aiming for Im assuming he was trying to hit  near  my car, but not actually  hit  my car. My only means of defense was my  million candle power spotlight, so a standoff was reached; every time theyd shoot at me, Id blind them and every time I blinded them, theyd shoot at me (LOL) This only ended when Andrew called me and I told him to send Cam out to help my carry my bags up (lol).  We didnt really do much, just talked till 5am then fell asleep. Cam woke me up at 9:45 but I didnt actually get up until 10:15, right as Adri called me to see if I was coming to a tiny Baptist church three blocks from Beckys house where Mr. Weber was preaching. He had told us last week that he was going to preach there and had tried to get as many people to come with him because the church was full of old people (LOL). So, we did and we highschoolers outnumbered the regulars two to one. When Weber was done preaching he called the 60+ year old Frank No-So-Hotra (LOL!!) up to give an announcement. Everyone applauded in hilarious agreement though when Weber proclaimed that Frank actually was hot. Man that guys so funny.  Later, I went back to Beckys house to return her moms belt. (lol) Before I knocked or rang the doorbell Becky opened it and our entire converstation went as follows:  Her: Dont *muffled, but it sounded close to ring the doorbell*. Me: Dont ring the doorbell? Her: Yeah my moms sleeping. Me: Ok, see yah. Her: Bye.

      Woot, I'm finally posting from my spiffy laptop hidden away in some remote corner of my house (My parents don't even know I have it ;) ). Yeah, anyway, the last couple days have been dandy for me...   Note:  All that stuff that I said about my mom, well I'm leaving it... I kinda have a policy here on my blog that once I post something, it stays 'cause that's how I felt when I wrote it and the whole purpose of a blog is kinda destroyed once one goes back and starts editing previous posts to conform them to their current frame of mind. Anyway, with that said and with the assurance that my mom and I are back on friendly terms again (We've fully discussed the incident(s) and have come to the conclusion that if given the chance to re-live them, we'd have done stuff differently), I'll go back to the part about the last couple days being dandy...   I got to drive my car again for the first time on Sunday! *Woot again!* I kinda ...erm, left early and went to Goodwill where I was extremely happy to find a connector for this laptop, the only part infact that has been preventing me from getting it on the web. Btw, I forget the processor speed, but it has 12Mb of RAM, a 154Mb HD, and a 640x480 display running at 256 colors. LOLOL Beastie machine huh? I can't believe it actually runs Trillian... and IE at the same time! Anyway, I finally got over to Calvary, stayed a while, saw Bwitty (that's always cool - she's fun to hang around), and finally saw Cam after almost two weeks... Man I was going through Cam-withdrawal (LOL) He was doing good, but now there's some stuff going on that's really screwing with him so... yeah sux.  Anyway, on Monday, I couldn't believe it; Gwen gave the message for Opening (our Monday morning chapel). I'm proud of her... that takes guts. It was about depression and conquering it through happiness in God's love... exactly the type of struggle I'm going through right now... and have been for the last two years infact. Yeah... Monday was awesome after that.  Today I got out of an entire day of school ('cept the last ten minutes of my last class) because we had an all-day field trip to the state capital, Salem. That was cool... during our trip to the actual capital building, they had an earthquake drill. That was pretty stupid; we didn't even know what it was... I was sliding down one of the huge marble ramp things on either side of the two flights of stairs (LOL, intended as decoration, not actually to slide down, though even out elderly tour guide admitted to having done so herself at one point..... HAHAHA), and some guy walked into the rotunda and blasted a blowhorn siren. We were all like 'um... wha..?' Yeah that was fun.  I've got a huge report for Spanish due... um today (hehe) that I'm having a very hard time completing... I don't get it, I have all the info at my fingertips, I just can't seem to compile it. Ah well, there's always tomorrow.  I talked to Mandy today too, FINALLY (lol) and we're still on for prom, same with Steven and Becky. Should be fun...  Goodnight world! I love  all  most of you :)

             Yeah it's been a bit since I posted last... Here are pictures of random happenings of late:   Mel's house tonight  *looks at clock* I guess it was last night actually. All the people in these pictures plus Gwen, YoungHee and Adri went to see Shrek 2... Fairly good movie actually, pretty funny. Later all of us minus Adri and YoungHee went back to Mel's (where the pics were taken) to watch Evil Alien Conquerors. Note I only happened to remember that I had my camera with me and subsequently use it   after   Gwen left, so though she isn't in any of the pictures, she was there with us most of the evening. o.O James, one of the guys in the pictures, gave me one of his shirts from back when he used to work at Wendy's! So cool... (lol)   My NEST group's last meeting on Friday  (a school mandated grouth group of sorts)   My cellphones on Thursday  (Note the plural... I got my phone replaced but forgot to back up the phone directory... It pays to have friends in Sprint: I got to keep them both for a day.)

      Listening to:  Plankeye - Call Me Liar    riddled with the pain of falling short i promised you i'd always try my hardest and do you think i'm trying no i wouldn't either call me liar call me anything you want my heart's on fire now everything is wrong flown and flung away the hardest sort don't think that i would hurt you by intention and do you think that i'm trying no i wouldn't be surprised call me liar call me anything you want i'm caught in the wires and everything is gone   Man, the last two days have been so surreal to me... especially Thursday night. I was crying for a variety of reasons almost the entire retreat - rarely actually in tears but my soul wept the entire time. Winema is always emotional for me, but this one was a thousand times more so. As I told someone, "I love/hated it"   Holy crap, I thought I was done, but no. (I'm crying again)

      I wrote this in 3rd period Senior English on Wed. when all the seniors were gone, going on the retreat one day early.    The Seniors    The times you've left me with Are all but passed me by, And you go on with life While I sit here and cry.  Eyes will dry, tears will pass And my life too will go on. Until that time, here, now, My mem'ries I'll ponder on.  For none can know what lies in store,      'Save but the great Divine Through trust in Him I'll tarry on,      On 'till the end of time.  And you with Him I know I'll meet      If never again shall see, Past the last day of this summer      When I a Senior, be.    Yeah, um... I was sad.

      The weirdest thing just happened to me... I was leaving my friend's house which happens to be four houses down from Mr. Olesen (my IT team leader)'s house and he started pulling out of his driveway. I passed him and a couple streets down he pulled alongside me because I was turning left and he was going straight. I waved at him but he didn't seem to recognize me and it was our turn to go, so I turned and continued on my way thinking I'd ask him at our next meeting if he realized later who it was. A tiny bit later, I turned left again onto TV Highway and started cruising in the left lane, when who should pull up alongside me, but... Mr. Olesen (lol) He motioned for me to pull over to the side of the road and started to do so himself so I followed suit by putting my turn signal on and starting to switch to his lane so I could get off onto the shoulder. Right at that moment some idiot it a raised pickup decided to gun it and swerve around him before he was even out of his lane, in the process cut off the person behind me and nearly collided with me. I swerved back into my lane as he roared past then signaled and finally got off onto the shoulder. Mr. Olesen saw the entire thing and had to drive up to meet me since I was a significant ways down the road after that idiot cut me off. The reason for all this was that he had loaned me a key to a storage unit that we were storing a ton of PCs in and needed it back - when he saw me he thought he'd come flag me down but "didn't anticipate almost getting me into a wreck" LOL

It's great for people like me and Steven... Though better for him than 'cause of his Pocket PC. Later I'll see about browsing their network, but I'm quite content now using it to simply connect to the web and get removal tools for whatever varient of Mydoom happens to be afflicting the laptop. Let their network get infected, not mine. *evil grin* ;) [/Edit]

      Powerful song that does a good job of capturing our youth's want-everything-now mindset (plus it's just plain beautiful)  Listening to:  Freshman - Verve Pipe    When I was young I knew everything She a punk who rarely ever took advice Now I'm guilt stricken, Sobbing with my head on the floor Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  My best friend took a week's Vacation to forget her His girl took a weeks's worth of Valium and slept And now he's guilt stricken sobbing with his Head on the floor Thinks about her now and how he never really Wept he says  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  hey yeah  hey yeah hey yeah   We've tried to wash our hands of all this We never talk of our lacking relationships And how we're guilt stricken sobbing with our Heads on the floor We fell through the ice when we tried not to Slip, we'd say  I can't be held responsible She was touching her face And I won't be held responsible She fell in love in the first place  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen  For the life of me I cannot remember What made us think that we were wise and We'd never compromise For the life of me I cannot believe We'd ever die for these sins We were merely freshmen We were merely freshmen

      Listening to  Moby - Porcelain    In my dreams I'm dying all the time Then I wake its kaleidoscopic mind I never meant to hurt you I never meant to lie So this is goodbye This is goodbye Tell the truth you never wanted me Tell me... In my dreams I'm jealous all the time Then I wake I'm going out of my mind Going out of my mind   Wow, I just went back and re-read my  entire  blog for the first time in a couple months. A blog's alot like a picture album, though it's got more than just the good times in it. I've never really thought about it like that before.  At the beginning of the year I spend 10+ hours compiling a book-almost of my blog posts from the first time I posted to the end of last year. Heh, most of it's depressing, but that's alright because my life's been a depressing one so I guess it accurately mirrors it.  Eventually I will print it out and maybe even put it on the web I think its over a hundred pages (lol).

      Well I took the SAT 1s today... the math sections were a piece of cake, even though I *erm* forgot my calculator. (LOL) Adri was the only other person I know going to Beaverton to take it too and we somehow got into the same room. That was cool. I gave her a ride home and am looking forward to her party later tonight.  On Thursday our entire school up and went to see a play at Heritage called Happens Every Summer at 11:something. I love my school, so funny - mandatory play patronization. The play was pretty lacking in content, bad script choice, though the talent was wonderful. By the end of it I wanted to run up and punch the Georgian hoe (though the fact she was, after all, just an actress taking the form of the character held me back - LOL).   Thursday also, my mom had to take our orange cat Leo into be put down. Sux, but he's been in a ton of pain and stuff from his leg all his life so I guess it's a good thing. We got another cute cute black kitten a couple hours ago and my sister's occupying herself with that one now.  Speaking of pets, Gwen has to take Rascal, her dog, to the vet today at 2:30 to put her down too. Sux... That's gonna be a ton harder on her than my sister's cat has been on her since Gwen's had her dog for something like 12 years. Yeah, I'll see how she's doing at the party tonight I guess.   ... Heh, if I can go that is... My mom's being weird about homework again - might not let me go tonight.

'Got up around 10 o'clock, took a shower, headed to CCWC for the first time in ... forever. I saw Sarah (Steven's gf) for the second time there, the first was in Jan. (I think - lol) Later I ran into the Gadeholts and Ben, and followed them over to the Gadeholt's house where I stayed until past 9. Well, that's not entirely true, I did go with them to pick up Kat from Washington square and to go eat at Xtine's restraunt... but that doesn't count since I was with them.   Man, that was fun... I miss my sophmore year.

      Well, I went to  PCC 's youth group tonight. 'Twas a special service because their 80-person choir just got back from a tour in Cali - only went to 8 o'clock. There was a party afterwards at someone's house till 10... LOL That was a huge amount of cars for that small a street. It was only like 70 out, and some crazy people jumped into the pool anyway... the spa I understand, but not the pool.  Afterward, while I was driving home on TV highway, west of 170th, I saw a photo-radar vehicle on the side of the road and immediately checked my speed... under 55, so I didn't slow down. When I passed it though, the thing flashed and when I got home I checked with my mom and apparently that section of road's 45, not 55. Gayness... whatever, so I guess I have my first ticket... I'm upset, but not about the ticket so much as how little the thing was that I got it for... I wanted my first ticket to be for going 120 in a 45 or something like that...   Oh well.

      Listening to:  Story of the year - Sidewalks   I should prolly get to bed eventually. (lol) Yesterday morning I stayed up untill past 6am I think... Doubt that I'll repeat that this morning, but I'm well on my way.  I didn't really do anything today 'cept work on assorted computer stuff and clean my room(s). I removed that LAN I had running secretly into my upstairs room because I'm moving entirely down here and if I ever need it again, it's quite easy to reinstall... just need another half-hour with the house to myself.  Oh, Brent called me right after 11 tonight (... technically last night) and said that Tyler had run over to Bally but it had gotten dark and he needed a ride. Brent would have done it, but he was sick, so I got to get out of the house to give him a ride... I LOVE driving at night... hot nights. I'm getting better at driving with my knees; nothing beats blazing down TV highway at 70+ with the seat reclined and your hands behind your head with the windows down and the music blazing at midnight on a hot summer night. ;)  Dos cervesas~ ('two beers' in Spanish)

      I very *heart* this song...    Story of the Year - Sidewalks    The bridge is all crumbled.  The water soaks into rocks  that fell at the bottom of the road (At the end of the town.) The town that we lived in.  The memories shaken apart from the weeds that grow  Over the sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  Or   Out on the front porch,  watching the cars as they go by (Eighteen blue, twenty one grey)  Looking ahead for the first time that we could drive,  Out on our own,  To speed away   From the sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  Or   All of the days have passed us by,  All of the sun is gone... away.   Sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,   Sidewalks,  Running away from the streets we knew,  Sidewalks,  Like the time we thought was made for you.  (Sidewalks)  The bridges are crumpled,  (Sidewalks)  The water soaks into rocks,  That fell at the bottom of the road.

      You know what? Forget the whole PocketPC vs. Palm war... I'm going for the mother of all PDAs...  OQO 's "Ultra Personal Computer"  Main selling point: It runs WinXP... Full version.  It should be out in the Fall, running for under $2K   [Edit] For some reason the pics in this post were causing the new template to screw up, so I er... removed them... problem solved ;) [/Edit]     Specifications:  1GHz Transmeta processor  20GB hard drive (shock-mounted)  256MB DDR RAM  Dimensions: 4.9" x 3.4" x .9"  Weight: 14 ozs  800 x 480 W-VGA 5" transflective display (indoor/outdoor readable)  3D accelerated graphics with 8mb video RAM  QWERTY thumb keyboard with mouse buttons and TrackStik  802.11b wireless  Bluetooth wireless  4-pin FireWire (1394)  USB 1.1  3.5mm stereo headphone jack (supports stereo headphone or mono headset plus optional multimedia controller)  Microphone  Digital pen  Removable lithium polymer battery  Battery life 2-6 hours, depending on usage    OQO docking cable includes:  3D accelerated 1280 x 1024 VGA video output  Additional USB  Additional FireWire (1394)  Ethernet  DC power  Audio out    Additional features:  Active hard drive protection that safely parks hard drive heads upon detecting freefall  Screen that slides on rack and pinion mechanism to reveal thumb keyboard  Shift, control, function and alt keys that have smart-lock with LED indicators  Thumbwheel allows for traditional scrolling as well as enhanced features  Ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts backlight to appropriate level  External antenna connector for 802.11b (in addition to built-in diversity antennas)    Included accessories:  Power cord & AC adaptor  Docking cable  Desktop stand  Digital pen  Carrying sleeve   The only possible drawback I've figured on so far is the lack of "instant on" now so familiar to PDA owners... Like all other PCs, you have to boot it up.

      I'm now hosting the raw footage I shot of the airsoft war at Pat's on Wednesay on Kazaa... the filename is stupidpigeon.6-16-04.entire.day.avi .  It's around 334Mb, divx encoded (actual codec needed: DX50), Length: 47 minutes and 16 seconds, Resolution: 352 by 240.  I may eventually  dropload  it to the stupidpigeon forum as well, but I'm going to edit it and splice it into   That is all.

      I really, REALLY need to update about the last week and a half and I'm at summer school and a poster I noticed up on the wall of all the graduates walking down the isle almost two weeks ago inspired me to finally come back and update this (lol).  Friday... I got to the last day of school at the beginning of the LAST PERIOD... I had set my phone (my suto-alarmclock) on vibrate the night before for my sister's 8th grade grduation, so when it went off to wake me up, it well... vibrated. My parents apparenly didn't see the wisdom in actually venturing into my room untill close to noon, but rather, repeatedly called my phone, which again, was on vibrate. When I got to school, I handed in a project and took a test, neither of which were for the class that I had that period... and spent the rest of the time walking around school with my video camera.  Later that night was Faith's Senior Graduation. As is my custom, I videotaped that in its entirety as well. I'm thinking about encoding it in divx and pushing it out onto Kazaa via my neighbor's connection... Might eventually get around to it, might not too...  Anyway, after the graduation, I went home, spent time doing... something, dunno what but in any event I spent quite a while doing it... packed up my computer and finally arrived at the first of 8 or so graduation parties I would be attending from then till Sunday night (Jon-Mark's) at around midnight. Yeah, that was great fun :) Many hours of watching random videos and tv shows, all off my computer, through the night. Mel was funny, every little while she thought she was leaving... in a little while, but eventually she just ended up staying the entire night with us.  I went back to my house, or at least I think I went back to my house... not really sure... whatever, in any event, Jon-Mark, Darren and I went to several more grad parties on Sat, ending up at Eric Zoucha's that night... I had had no sleep for over 30 hours by this time and had been driving them around most of the day while they slept (lol) So it's completely understandable that I fell into a coma-like sleep on Eric's chair... and could not be wakened by any means whatsoever... well, understandable when you know that other time that I've fallen asleep like that, I've been shot with bb guns at point-blank and not waken up.  Anyway, they got a ride home with their dad, and I woke up past midnight at Eric's... I should have just stayed there, but I went back home. Many of us met up again at parties later Sunday, but I missed the one at their church that I wanted to go to.  That pretty much raps up the graduation weekend... on to more events of the week in further posts.

      Well I just woke up about 10 minutes ago... realized taht I've missplaced my glasses and don't feel like putting my contacts in, so I'm sitting back in my chair, for all practical purposes blind to the computer, touchtyping a post (lol). Wow, I think that was  along sentence but I'm not sure because I don't feel like quinting to read it ;) Speaking of touchtyping, I recal a time steven was here, turned around looking at my tv, talking to me, and still typing IMs behind his back  ... he just wanted me to mention that ;) (It did really happen though)  TO give you an idea of how late I've been getting to bed lately, I got to bed at 12:30 last night and it took three hours+ for me to get to sleep. LOL The start of summer school was this morning... I didn't make it... woke up at 2:30pm  I'm realizing now that I haven't really posted anything realivant to anything going on lately for the past week+ soI'm going to do taht, provided I find my glasses and/or contacts in a timely manner (lol)  For now, goodbye~

              pics from today   Yeah, so today was the Seniors' last day at school, plus Senior Wills as an end of day assembly. I got willed a senior star (something put on their locker at the beginning of the year... special way to remember the person by when you get one willed to you) by Matt and Gwen, a t-shirt with paint on it from Lenny (from when we painted that church way back when...), some almost-finished bombs from our Chem. class from Gwen, and print of some of YoungHee's amazing artwork from... er... YoungHee. (lol)  I'm gonna ty to get my scanner online sometime tonight and post a scan of the print.  Later tonight I attended my sister Azita's 8th grade graduation.  Man school tomorrow's going to suck really bad and the graduation itself's not going to be much better. I shall be much crying. Hopefully the graduate's receptions later that night and the following day will cheer me up temporarily though.

       What if he was cradling a gun in his hands, mumbling, "Myyy preeeciousss" while he was walking around. I bet he wouldn't get mugged then.   o.O LOL!  ...found in  http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/05/30/2252233&mode=thread&tid=126&tid=137&tid=172 (a discussion about what geeks can do to help protect themselves and their valuables from muggers)  more comments on the topic:   In the UK, you are not allowed to own a gun, let alone carry one. Not even the cops carry fireamrs.  HALT! Or I'll be forced to yell HALT again, but louder!    --------------------------------------------------    That's not too far off from what I do. It's not jock-style, but it works for me.  I'm 6'2" tall, I have long black hair, a bullring style nose ring, a scuffed black leather jacket, a motorcycle and a visible knife clipped to my pocket.  I don't dress like I have money, and if I have to walk through a bad neighborhood, I make sure I look angry. My friends and I can walk past a gang, and they tend to part like the Red Sea.  I'm the scariest looking sysadmin I've seen in corporate america.     --------------------------------------------------    I have a friend that real life role plays. He was dressed up in his medieval armor and cloak garb waiting at a train station one day. A mugger came up to him with a 4 inch knife and said "give me your wallet". My mate stared him in the face and moved his cloak to reveal a 30 inch long sword. "I see your 4 and raise you 26". Should have seen him run.    --------------------------------------------------    I had a mugging problem when I was in San Francisco. Got mugged twice before I realized that muggers are very predictable. They like their targets to be predictable as well. I found that wearing a dirty shrunken wool jacket I got from goodwill, carrying extra bags, and yelling at people that wearen't there was a great way to avoid getting mugged.

       Excerpts from Paul Graham's ' Great Hackers ' essay:    "I've seen occasional articles about how to manage programmers. Really there should be two articles: one about what to do if you are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not. And the second could probably be condensed into two words: give up."  "Really good hackers are practically self-managing. The problem is, if you're not a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are. A similar problem explains why American cars are so ugly. I call it the design paradox. You might think that you could make your products beautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them. But if you yourself don't have good taste, how are you going to recognize a good designer?"  "Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers."  "One place this happens is in startups. At our startup we had Robert Morris working as a system administrator. That's like having the Rolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah. You can't hire that kind of talent. But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies of which they're the founders."  "They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why. I think what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously, is the next Microsoft. And of course if Microsoft is your model, you shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing great software. But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft, because no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other company is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be the next IBM."  "So who are the great hackers? How do you know when you meet one? That turns out to be very hard. Even hackers can't tell. I'm pretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker. You may have read on Slashdot how he made his own Segway. The remarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the software in one day (in Python, incidentally). For Trevor, that's par for the course. But when I first met him, I thought he was a complete idiot. He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling at him about something or other, and I remember standing behind him making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his office so we could go to lunch. Robert says he misjudged Trevor at first too. Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had just begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about every aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried with him everywhere. He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had a strong Canadian accent and a mullet."  "With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell. That's because, unlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects. When you get to hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn pretty quickly how hard they hit them back. But hackers can't watch themselves at work. So if you ask a great hacker how good he is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know. He's not just being modest. He really doesn't know.  "If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including him."     Greg Knauss 's rebuttle found on  waxy.org  :    You know what a hacker is? It's someone who enjoys solving problems. Great hackers do it elegantly. Good hackers do it at all. How they do it is irrelevant, and it certainly has nothing to do with what language they choose or what OS they run or if they're politically correct or not. To claim otherwise is arrogant, narrow-minded foolishness.  The fact that I'm learning C# and Windows.Forms does not make me any less of a hacker. In fact, it makes me more of one, because I'm able to solve a problem I couldn't with all the Python and Linux in the world. Oh, but I forgot: hackers only solve the problems that interest them, if they're presented in the right way and in the right environment. Because hackers are special.    also found on  waxy.org  :     Joshua  pointed out that while it may seem that every smart person I know is using open-source tools, it's a product of observational bias. Open-source programmers hang out with other open-source programmers. I don't know many Windows applications developers, so I've never met a Windows super-genius. But they exist, and to say they don't is a form of technophobic racism.

      "You just defaced property of the US government! ...You rebel" -Scully to Mulder  I woke up pretty late today... almost 11 or so, and headed over to school to get some work done. Jen and I were talking to Mel via IM around 2 and she invited us to come over to Washington Square for a bit with her friend whose name suddenly escape me and the friend's boyfriend, Joe. Anyway, we went sperately, and when I got there, I found them up at the Summit foodcourt getting well, food. (lol) I asked them where they lived and they responded Beaverton and North Plains and we were talking about how they were similar to Danie and Jon cause they live about the same distance away when I look up and see... Danie. LOL It took about ten minutes for any of the to notice us, but Danie, Jaime, their mom, their cousins and Jon were all there.            When we were done eating and such, we went down to Victoria's Secret to see if Cherry was there... Alas, she wasn't so we went across to the Mac store and messed with their computers. Now, anyone that knows anything about the difference between Macs and PCs knows that Windows cannot be installed on a Mac... at least not without an emulator, but that's complicated and a lot of people have no idea how to do that. Anyway, following Steven's example from the last time, I remote logged into first my computer and then both Steven's and my computers so it looks to the untrained eye, like the Macs have windows on them. I got a lot of strange looks. ;)

      I went to sleep this morning at around 4am and woke up somewhere around 8am. I spent like 45 minutes in the shower and so doing, made everyone slightly late to church. The little church we were going to is on the East side... just ten or so blocks away from my uncle's house. When we arrived there, we discovered that the service was going to be starting a bit later, so my sisters and I drove over to my uncle's house while mom practiced (she was playing for the service at the request of an old friend who attends the church). My uncle ended up not being home, so we called him and via his directions, met him and Natalia at a cafe a quarter mile away. That was fun, especially since I hadn't seen him in a month (due to his having been in Europe). We talked for a while, mostly about the impending divorce. I love talking to my uncle, granted he leans pretty leftwing-liberal in his thinking; he's got a good head on his shoulders and is very insightful.  My sisters and I ordered some breakfast along with them and only then discovered that the service was starting a lot earlier than we had thought. Eventually we got back to the church and quietly entered during the sermon... unfortunately for us, Mom and my Aunt were sitting in the very front, and I was wearing by far the brightest shirt in the building ;) Whatever, later my mom had us stand up while she introduced us, so attention wasn't to be avoided anyway.   Later, once the service was over, we got to meet my mom's friend's daughter Deanna her friend Patricia. Patricia happened to be their old foreign exchange student from Germany and was back visiting them (or at least, that's how I understood it).  Anyway, the plan was for us to all go to the Kabob Khaneh (Kabob House) in Beaverton, and my sisters and I rode along with Deanna and Patricia. That was fun... when I first got in the car the radio was playing Verve Pipe - The Freshman. Deanna and I immediately starting singing along with it to the other rider's consternation... LOL  We ate, walked around a bit, took pictures (which one or both of them hopefully will be emailing to me soon so I get them up here...) and got ice cream and Hagendaz (spl?) Deanna's dad had some type of PDA that had a hangman game on it... that was a source of entertainment for a bit too. (lol)  Deanna and Patricia are really fun to hang around... wish we lived a little closer to each other, though Patricia is going back to Germany fairly soon so that's event further than the East side (LOL) Apparently Deanna's an amazing artist... she mentioned something about getting space in a gallery on this side of the river that we passed by... I should ask her about that.  We parted company around 2:30pm or so and we headed back home, and Pat came over shortly there after. We set around for a while and eventually got some flowers and headed over to Adri's house (who just got her wisdom teeth out a couple days ago...) She's feeling better, but still looks like a self-described chipmunk (lol). She wanted me to take a picture of her and post it, but we forgot about it... maybe tomorrow or something.  Yeah and the rest of the day's been rather boring now that Pat left...

      Yeah... for some reason some of us felt like skipping youth group yesterday so we had a party at my house. I was talking to Sara last week and she mentioned going to see the Bourne Supremacy, Thursday night at midnight, so I thought why not have everyone else come too? Unfortunately Mandy, Adri, Katy V and Steven weren't able to be out that late for one reason or another so they came to the party but didn't come with Mel, Katie, Matt R, Josh H, Andrew, Pat, Allen and I to the movie.  The party was interesting... we watched two different movies at the same time, The Bourne Identity (since it's rather essential to see before seeing the sequel) and Good Burger. Then arm wresting and... er... leg wresting - something I'd never seen before.  The movie was fairly good... great plot, but I hated the ending and the cinematography during some of the action scenes was heavily annoying... infact the final chase scene was downright boring as a result.  Pat, Matt, Andrew and Josh stayed overnight afterward... we watched Kill Bill - strange, strange movie (directed by the same person that did Pulp Fiction) one of the scenes had to be black and white just to avoid an NC-17 rating. LOL  We woke up at noon or so and I took Andrew to work shortly there after... Then we that remained had fun shooting some bottles and fences and... houses with Pat's AEGs. Then came the water balloons... that kept us occupied for a couple hours (it's just a couple degrees shy of 100 today). I finally pegged a car that I was trying to hit for a while then we focused our effort on more... shall we say, mobile targets.  Josh, Matt and Pat left around an hour ago and I'm in my room listening to  American Hi-Fi - Nothing Left to Lose

      My piece of sh*t motherboard is yet again having issues with my videocard so my primary computer is out of comission until I have the initiative to remove every component and power it back up sequentially 'till it decides that it's no longer broken.  Gay computer.  On sunday, as you already know from the previous post, I woke up late and went to a local school where some friends of mine were hainging out. After everyone dispersed, Pat and I went over to Adri's to bug her and kill time before he had to be at college group at Pr. Drew's house. I decided to be adventurous and see if Drew would let me come too (though I'm still a senior) and after many inventive ways of finding his phone number, I finally was able to ask, and he yes, it was fine to visit it that night. I followed Pat over, driving my dad's ber spiffy car (hehe).   Yeah, that was a great night... been a long time since I played Mau with Sara & Beth(LOL) There were a ton of people there that I know but had no idea went there.  At the end of the night, Greg Anderson and I were talking ... mostly about my family and stuff, and I mentioned that it's like they're divorced, but still living together, infact if it weren't for us, they would be divorced. He had trouble hearing me and asked "but they're not actually divorced right?" ... Little did I know.  ... Which brings me to my next news flash... My parents are getting a divorce. I was informed that night when I got home ironically.  Man, I really wish I could join that college group... I need some people like them in my life right now.

      First, let me comment that blogger  again  has changed slightly for the better... but just the backend, so all you non-bloggers can't see what I'm talking about.   Second... Peter and Solana are gone, GONE... kinda. (lol) They be in Aussyland now. Here are some pictures from the airport today around 6-7ish:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      I had picked up Andrew and met Brady and Pat at CCWC to carpool out to Peter's to pick him up and go to the airport, so we (-Peter) went back to CCWC afterward, a bit after youth group started. Brady left cause he's old (lol), but Pat, Andrew and I stayed... at first in the 'Nursing Mom's room' (which is really tight... there'a one-way mirror so you can see/hear everything that's going on in the sanctuary but no one can see/hear you. Eventually though, the senior high went upstairs, so we followed, but skipped shortly there after (-Pat, +Matt &amp; Josh H) and went to Freddy's. On the way back we ran into the rest of our clique and here are pictures from then on:     urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink      Now for the stupidness... I had some spraypaint in my car which we had been lead to believe was water soluble. Someone had sprayed a big smily face on one side of the parking lot and we had set a big firework off ontop of it. Nothing much more happened for a while and almost everyone left. We were starting to get a bit more crazy (lighting firecrackers off between people's feet and such... LOL@Adri) when I got the great idea of writing some random words on the parking lot like L337 H4x0r and stuff... (lol). About that time, Steven needed to use the restroom and since everywhere else was closed, he went over to the gas station across TV highway. While he was walking over, Andrew set of another bomb we had made and crap, that thing was LOOOOOOOOOUD. Steven said he heard it echoing off the theater and other buildings more than a block away while he was walking across the highway. 'Twas so loud infact, that we pretty much told everyone still around that they should leave... NOW. (worried about cops)   Anyway, I was taking Andrew and Steven home... and Steven wasn't there, so we cruised around and eventually found him. We decided to go back to the parking lot after a bit whe we new it was safe and realized that the spraypaint and stuff prolly wasn't going to come off as easily as we thought. We spent the next hour (up till almost midnight) trying different things, even going over to a 7-11 to get Coke to see if it'd lift the paint. ... Nothing worked.   Here are some pictures of the mess:     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Yeah... that was increadibly stupid. I called the church office asking someone to call me back tomorrow *looks at clock*... today to see about how I could help clean it up.   'Ne wayz, I'm tired and it may not look like it, but it actually takes an increadible long time to post all those pictures correctly, so I'm going to bed.

             Yeah, I got an earing today... Summer school's gonna be interesting: my school's got this thing about guys and earings... they hate them. (lol) Apparently though I can get away with wearing a band-aid over it... don't ask me, I'm not the one that made up the rules. ;)  In other news:   Scheduled Downtime    We are planning to have 2 hours of downtime tomorrow night, July 13, between 8p-10p (Pacific Time). Blogging should resume as normal after 10p.  Jason G. [7/12/2004 04:36:27 PM]

      Listening to:  Smile Empty Soul - For You     I waited for you I died inside my own head  and I'd die again for you  I'm faded and tired  completely uninspired  and I'd die again for you  so kill me with the love that you won't give to me, give to me and pack the wound with salt i want to feel it bleed  I'm searching for reasons  to keep away the demons and I'd die again for you I wish you were near me  could feel it when you hear me say I'd die again for you  so kill me with the love that you won't give to me, give to me and pack the wound with salt I want to feel it bleed, feel it bleed you wanted me to crawl so now I'm on my knees,on my knees  why's it always have to be me  that's always left out to burn and I'll never learn  so kill me with the love that you won't give to me, give to me and pack the wound with salt I want to feel it bleed, feel it bleed you wanted me to crawl so now I'm on my knees, on my knees    Life throws me so many curves... it's a wonder that I haven't killed myself a thousand times over...  Gah, forget that.

      Well, I'm leaving in like 2 minutes to take my dad to the airport... He's going to Iran for a month; there's a countdown timer at the top of the column on the right that shows how long till he gets back. :)

It's really cool... there's a huge open reservoir (several hundred feet to a side) with banks going up to 100 feet tall... would be an awesome place to set off some mortars. There's also a wide street that no one uses yet that's awesome to try out skids and stuff on.  'Ne way, after that, I met Andrew and Jon at Wu's (a Chinese restaurant) and then went back to Andrew's for a night of fun. (lol) I just got home several minutes ago and felt like posting, so here I am...  Actually, I'm not that tired... that's not a good thing since I've slept through summer school this entire week. :P

      Yeah... I was at Darren and Jon-Mark's today for their joint birthday party... I *ahem* only found out that it was a party for  both of them  after I got there, so I only got Darren a present. (Sorry Jon, yours is coming - lol) Darrens birthday was today, Jon's is this Sat.  Btw, I'm operating like yesterday is actually 'today' again on account of my not having slept yet, so Darren's b-day is actually on the 8th.  I didn't get any pictures or anything because my mom has the camera at the moment... and I just found out today that my dad's taking our camcorder with him on his month-long trip to Iran in a week; a fact that I'm none to pleased about and that has me working like mad dumping footage onto my computer and editing it before he takes it.  Whatever... I've got summer school tomorrow morning and I've slept though it every other day this week so I'd better get off and at least try to get to sleep.  G'night world~

      Here's the pics and video from Adri's party...  7-2-04, 7-3-04 sleepover (33:46)  urlLink divx 233Mb  If you don't have the divx codec, get it! (you can find the latest version  urlLink here )                                                                                On Monday I went up to Brady's house for what was supposed to be another going-away party for Peter, but alas, Peter himself could not make it. (LOL) Anyway, Pat, Brady, Cori and I just hung out for a while. That was pretty fun. While I was up there, I tried to dl that fireworks video from last post and decided that I wanted to make a short video of just the cooler stuff fireworks that we set off this weekend, so here it is:  Cool fireworks (1:53)  urlLink divx 12.8Mb   Then, yesterday (the 6th... I haven't slept tonight - still consider today the 7th) James 'became a number'. LOL He joined the Navy... Jen, MJ, Melissa, Darren and I went to MEPS to meet him and his gf, Jessica, and went with him to the airport to see him off.                                             Andrew and I were talking afterward and apparently he still is really thinking about going SEAL... the only issue is his eyes, but he prolly can get Lasic surgery. I've got the same problem as far as joining the SEALs, and we're both thinking that if the draft does get re-instated next year that we're going to enlist.  Today, I woke up really late for some reason... totally missed summer school (lol). I went to my math teacher's house for a party with my Calc class at 7pm. It was to finish watching LotR RotK, we'd finished the class early and were trying to watch all three movies before school was out, but we didn't make it in time, so Miss O, being the awsome teacher she is, invited us over to finish it. Everyone but Gwen and Danie came (we had a small class).

      Ok, this is the first set of a long train of movies and pictures that I'm going to be posting in the near future...  7.4.04 illegal fireworks (24:48)  urlLink low 5.39Mb   urlLink med 18.1Mb   urlLink high 40.7Mb   I highly suggest a download manager like  urlLink Getright .  A word of caution too: these files are hosted off my home connection... If they become too much of a burden on my bandwidth, I'll take them down. So whenever possible, please try to keep your downloading to night time.  Oh, and sorry about the wmv format... I would encode them in something a little more cross-platform, but for all its failings, Windows Movie Maker does have the ability to compress video to insanely small files... and it only encodes in wmv. Contact me for a divx version of any of the movies and I'll post it if it's needed.  Thanks :)

      Listening to:  Story of the Year - Razorblades    Yeah, Yeah Walking example of you Wait for the silence Talking backwards to you It meant nothing to me Watching the world fall on you I'm keeping my eyes closed Now I can see what this means to you It meant nothing to me  [Chorus] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  Perfect timing for you You'll run 'til your legs break So here's my reminder of you It meant nothing to me  [Chorus] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end...GO!  We should've seen this coming We should've seen this... YEAH! YEAH!  [Chorus x2] This wasted so many nights and again I've wasted so much time on a friend Too young, too proud to understand So this is the end  YEAH! This is the END!   The last couple days have been awesome! Partying non-stop... On the 1st, Spiderman at the Redshaw's house then Spiderman II at the theater (good movie btw, I'm never watching the first one by itself again), then afterward back to the Redshaw's, then to Wendy's. And yeah Darren, the people sitting beside us were prolly confused as heck... ROFL ... Good times, good times. Anyway, after eating, a firework at the Redshaw's again then off to their youth group (short but fun). Still after, walking all over the place, hanging out with Tye, who I've not seen in years (at least I think...) and then finally blowing up a big firework in front of Matt R's unsuspecting house somewhere close to 11.  Then on the 2nd... Getting to summer school late, staying until 2, giving Kat a ride to Neil's house... playing pool and badminton for a while, then picking up Steven from his work and getting over to Adri's house past 5:30. Basically everyone from our circle of friends at school was there save Gwen who happened to have left for a couple-week long mission trip the same morning. We sneaked into the garage and surprised them by coming in through the back of the house... that was great fun. At some point we were messing around outside and someone stuck Adri in a compost recycling bin (ensuing chaos and funness... like the owners of the bin coming out of their house and us fleeing, and the girls getting into a water fight which led to them getting into the hot tub in the back). Josh and I went back to our houses and got several swimsuits, and we and Steven joined them. Then pizza and the fireworks....   HAHAHAHA... that was great too; I constructed a petebomb that had an actual piccolo pete as the igniter... Everyone had been warned to stay back and cover their ears - it would be loud, but the fuse took a while to work so when the peter finally caught they started to relax and think that that was the only thing going to happen... hehe, like I planned it. *evil grin* Then, without warning, BOOM the thing blew up and the entire cul-de-sac (spl?) was filled with little crackling fireballs. LOL that was so funny.  After this, Steven, Josh, Darren, and I came up to my house quickly (kinda...) to make a couple more bomb-style fireworks which we eventually lit off in the LDS stakehouse parking lot later by ourselves (the plan was for everyone else to come after we'd set it up and watch, but Adri's mom wouldn't let them. It was huge... we attached three 'normal-sized' bombs together.  We took Josh and Josiah back home less than a minute before their curfew and headed back to Adri's where we found a disgruntled crowd amiss at not having witnessed the big firework... so we took a walk all the way to Josh's house (but didn't go in... his dad didn't want him up... then continued to our English teacher's house outside of which we set and talked for a while and finally headed home and found Rachel, Jen and Mandy in the hot tub.  At this point, Steven and I were the only guys left and we didn't feel like leaving so ... er, we didn't (lol). I eventually got back into the hot tub only to get right back out again to go back up to my house to grab my glasses, contacts kit and chargers / batteries for both cameras and my phone (which everyone had killed by talking to Josh for over an hour - lol).   We just hung out and watched movies until like 7 or 8am when some people went back over to pick up Josh and Josiah again. Steven had to be at Sarah's at noon, and hadn't packed yet so I took him home shortly there after, and went back to my house and crashed around 9... Thus ending yet another co-ed sleepover. (lol)   I woke up past 6pm, took a shower, left, got gas, and arrived at Peter's in Forest Grove close to 9. Everyone just got back from an hour of warwalking a few minutes after, so I came at a good time. We spent a couple hours constructing and setting off fireworks... we got pretty crazy t'word the end... just dumping everything we could get out hands on into cinderblocks and throwing lit fireworks into them... hehe  *I wonder if the sparkler writing's still on the ground...*  I finally left past close to 2am and decided that I was going to do that speed test of my car right then and there... was tired of trying to set up a time for people to film me doing it. ;) But... after passing the second police car and encountering a lot of traffic on highway 8 before I even got to the section I was going to test on, I decided to call it off. I made up for it though by going 90mph on Rosedale and 110mph on 175th. :D ... That was great fun.  I'm sitting at home writing this right now, getting ready to head over to the Neff's for yet another evening of fun and fireworks...  I've got pictures of the last several days and I'm working on compressing the video I shot so I can get it up on my server... those will be up within a couple days pending the approval of everyone [read: the girls] who was at the sleepover that might be finnicky about it.  Bye everyone, cya ya'll soon enough~

       This is highly amusing...   A short list of my favorite 'things not allowed to do':   33. Not allowed to chew gum at formation, unless I brought enough for everybody.   34. (Next day) Not allowed to chew gum at formation even if I *did* bring enough for everybody.   58. The following words and phrases may not be used in a cadence- Budding sexuality, necrophilia, I hate everyone in this formation and wish they were dead, sexual lubrication, black earth mother, all Marines are latent homosexuals, Tantric yoga, Gotterdammerung, Korean hooker, Eskimo Nell, we've all got jackboots now, slut puppy, or any references to squid.  84. Must not use military vehicles to Squish' things.   87. If the thought of something makes me giggle for longer than 15 seconds, I am to assume that I am not allowed to do it.   94. Crucifixes do not ward off officers, and I should not test that.   100. Claymore mines are not filled with yummy candy, and it is wrong to tell new soldiers that they are.   106. I may not trade my rifle for any of the following: Cigarettes, booze, sexual favors, Kalishnikovs, Soviet Armored vehicles, small children, or bootleg CDs.   118. Burn pits for classified material are not revel fires - therefore it is wrong to dance naked around them.   132. The loudspeaker system is not a forum to voice my ideas.   145. I should not drink three quarts of blue food coloring before a urine test.   146. Nor should I drink three quarts of red food coloring, and scream during the same.   165. I do not get 'that time of month'.   175. We do not 'charge into battle, naked, like the Celts'.   184. When operating a military vehicle I may *not* attempt something 'I saw in a cartoon'.   195. Shouldn't use Photoshop  to create incriminating photos of my chain of command.   205. Don't write up false gigs on a HMMWV PMCS. ("Broken clutch pedal", "Number three turbine has frequent flame-outs", "flux capacitor emits loud whine when engaged")

      ... finally (lol)  It took over 16 straight hours of driving to cover the 900 or so miles from LA back here. I just got in the door a couple minutes ago and am going to crash... There's a lot to write about the vacation (like talking to this awesome DOD bounty hunter, riding the largest looping rollercoaster on earth, shooting down 75 foot waterslides, etc.) I'm going to bed... I'll post about it tomorr... later today (lol)

      We got up this morning and vacated our crappy motel pretty quickly. My mom had gone out on a walk with Cynthia, her friend who lives locally in San Fransisco, and had just come back when we my sisters and I were waking up. We left our car at the Cynthia's and walked down the Fisherman's Wharf where we caught a tour ferry and rode around the bay for an hour and a half. Then we walked up to Ghiradelli Square, had lunch and stopped in at Cynthia's house for a while. She has a projector, screen and surround sound system in her bedroom! :) :) Exiting the city, we drove down Lombard street (the windiest street in the U.S.).  It took us over 6 hours to drive to LA (well, actually Vernonia - an LA suburb that Six Flags is located in). It's interesting: we've driven  exactly  1000.1 miles from my front door to the front of this hotel... We've got a picture to prove it. :)The hotel that I'm staying's within sight of Six Flags in a major way... it's like the only thing you can see looking out the windows (hehe)  Btw, my sisters and mom are trying to sleep so they kicked me out of the room and into the bathroom where I'm finishing up this post now ;)

      This is getting pretty rediculous... We reserved a room with this hotel here but they somehow overbooked, so they sent us to another hotel which didn't have room either, so now we're back again and have been wating for... over an hour... this is really starting to piss me off.

      Well, here we are screaming down the road at over 100mph.. My mom's at the wheel and it feels like we've got a couple jatos strapped to our butt. Our average speed's been around 85-90 the  entire way  out of Portland. It seems the max we've had to slow down had been to 70 in heavy ish  traffic. A bit ago we stopped in Redding to change our windshield wipers (yes, it was actually raining earlier, though the windshield's been coated with an enzime that stops rain from sticking so you almost don't even need the wipers). I picked up a pair of sunglasses for 99 cents (hehe). If they last me the rest of the week, they'll have been worth it.  Btw, I've had my eyes closed for most of this post... (spl check works wonders)

      Listening to:  Unwritten Law - Blame it on Me   Well, we're sitting here in the car on the highway just south of Roseburg... sitting, not really driving. (lol) The bright orange "Wreck Ahead" signs littering the side of the road and the fact that the left lane's blocked off with cones offers some explanation as to why.   This laptop's starting to become an annoying weight on my legs so I might put it down soon but I don't really feel like it yet.  Yeah, we just passed the accident site... from the looks of it, a 'fifth wheel' camper came off its frame and fell onto the road.

      Well everyone, the Block final wasn't very hard (big surprise).  All we did was read the short stories.  But, (stupid Malon ey ) made us do the dumbest things.  We had to answer all sorts of questions for each question.  And, he made us list 3-5 qualifications of a short story.  Pretty dum, that man.  Then in the second hour we finish the movie.  It's so sad that  urlLink Jenny  dies from AIDs in the end.  I didn't know that... But now I do.  I'm in another battle with  urlLink Joe  and  urlLink DJ Studios .   urlLink This  is the thread that it's all happening in.  I update the animations on the main page, don't know if you noticed...

      Yesterday marked the release of a temp.  urlLink bodyvisual , as I'm sure you already know.  I finally figured out how to get the XML into Flash, so everything you see can be controlled dynamically through one XML file.  Also, all together in size it is only about 8kb.  Very quick to load.  Today is the Block final.  I think that it is stupid we have to stay for all three hours.  But, maybe it's just me...  I'll post and let the 2/3 period know what to expect.  All the reports from Monday were really vague.  Anyway, I got that job at the  urlLink College  that I wanted.  Yesterday I sent off my resumé to  urlLink several   urlLink agencies  that  urlLink Brian  recommended, after saying that I couldn't work with him.  Oh well.  The job @ uni is great because they give me vacation time.    Peace.

      Well, today marked the first day of my  urlLink job  at the university.  For a first day I worked incredibly long (6.5 hours), but it was fun.  The project we're doing is archiving all the old aerial photos of the region (some as old as 1926).  This includes scanning them in at the best dpi (hell to calculate) and then adjusting the curves in PS so the histogram is balanced.  It seems like it may be a cool project, because there is a web part, which I am going to get, earning me $3000 by the end of the 10 weeks.  After work I was uber tired.  But, I went and took some shots of the gardens because it was a really nice evening.  You can see those pictures  urlLink here .  I am learning better how to focus the camera with the AiAf, and have managed to get several really crisp pictures.  The 4.0 mp does wonders, and the colour is sooo rich!  Take care, TGIF tomorrow x___x  m.

However, if anyone is sincere about wanting their own account, you can mail me  urlLink here , and I'll see what I can do.  Also, I got paid for the first time yesterday.  The check was for 103 dollars, which I promptly spent all but six of.  Hehe.  I bought a sweet little cruzer mini with 256mb capacity and the new tiesto cd (which kicks ass).    Peace out,  michael

[quote] For those of you who have not yet installed 0.9 of FireFox you might want to backup before you do. Some people have reported cases while upgrading that their systems have locked up, then upon restart it executed an infinate loop sucking all system resources until all of the programs crashed.

      I have uploaded a  urlLink working sample  of what I have spent the last week and two days designing and building.  The site is entirely dynamic, making use a XML backend ( urlLink view ).  Any comments are welcomed, just leave a comment.  It is still in development.  peace out

      Work is slowly killing my vision.  Right now I have a slight pain behind my eyes, which I have a funny suspicion is from looking at a computer screen since 8:15 this morning.  Earlier I had a major problem with XML, but thanks to a good person at kirupa, the problem was solved.   urlLink Mike  finally got his Gmail account, and told me he has been frantically emailing people all day.  hehehe.  Michelle's back from Korea (or has been since last Monday).  She bought me a 'Be The Reds' shirt because I love it so much.  *hugs michelle*.  Well, back to work.. almost done, just another hour...  *rubbs eyeballs*  I think I'll go take a walk...   peace out  //edit:  I filled up my 256mb flash drive with music today from  urlLink music.download.com .  I really like T1, as I downloaded all that music in less than 20 minutes.  Absolutly amazing.. Too bad they are artists no one has ever heard of.. :)

      I have just released the somewhat beta, somewhat final version of the website for where I work.   urlLink CADIS .  Click to view.   The site has a XML backend, making all the text dynamically updateable.  I'd love to  urlLink  hear what you think .  peace out  On a side note, I think I'm getting sick of this layout.  And, I really wanna add some sort of a shout box-type thing.  Maybe a real cool flash/php-driven chalkboard... that'd be slick...  anyways, lemme know if you find any bugs...

      Yes, I've got 6 more Gmail invities, so if anyone wants these, feel free to  urlLink mail me  and I'll hook you up.  There are a few ppl at  urlLink kf  that I've promised, but not 6.  Anyways, at work I'm almost done with all the interfacing for the blue project.  I'll upload a working version later today, at work.  Yesterday I got some good shots of the garden; will upload later as well.  I had a good weekend overall.  We went to the town I used to live in, and my step-dad went to an old tavern.  hehehe.  peace out.  btw,  urlLink mike  has made a shoutbox and put it live on his site.. Very impressive; i'm envious.  I checked out two books tho...

      So after  urlLink Louis  signed up for blogger and used my previous template, I decided it was time for a general overhall.  Do let me know what you think.  I've modded some things, added some things, deleted some things.    About Macs: I've been thinking very hard about mac or windows.  And I've been reading  urlLink Mr. Hall's  blog.  It seems as tho there are many, many new and wonderful innovations that will be introduced into OS X and Tiger within the next year (more than a full year ahead of Longhorn).  One of the biggest things I want to use is Safari RSS.  I think the RSS searching feature will be s00per cool, and will provide a very easy way to keep up with all the crap I'm to lazy to.  I was talking to  urlLink Mike  earlier about Safari, and he said that it was interesting that I wanted to use Safari RSS and I had never used Mac before.  hehe, shows you how much Apple is getting to me.  Another thing that was  urlLink thrown around  was the possibility of a dual 64-bit windows system being capable of competing with a dual G5.  I personally like the idea of being able to stick with windows, because of familiarity and the software compatibility.  But at the same time I really want a change, and don't all designers use a Mac?  :)  It's raining very hard across the middle U.S., from OK to east TN.  And I burned my tongue.    I have four Gmail invitations for anyone who has not received one yet, or would like to try the service out.  You may email me  urlLink here  with your full name and email address.  It's been so long since I've done any personal design work.  And that's probably because Photoshop is broken on my home computer.  Bummer.    Everyone have a safe, happy 4th of July, and check out my  urlLink work desktop  and my  urlLink home desktop .  Screen manicure for BB tomorrow night!  Whoopie!  peace out

      I just finished watching the  urlLink WWDC 2004  in San Francisco.  It sounds like Apple is really making amazing strides, most importantly against Windows.  One thing that really blew my mind was the new  urlLink Power Mac G5 .  Dual 2.5ghz procesors, 1.25ghz FSB (a win system can't even compete), 64-bits of processing power, and other crazy new features that I can't even begin to describe.  I'm really excited about how cool Macs are now that I've really seen some of the new features that are going to be incorporated into Tiger.  And, to back track a little, the Power Mac's are starting at $1999, and come standard as dual processors (Dual G5, 900mhz FSB, etc).  So, now I'm faced with a tricky problem: Do I buy a Mac for less than (I think) the cost of building a dual processor PC, or do I go ahead with my familiar Windows XP and wait for Longhorn?  It's a tough decision.  One thing that I'm really worried about is the software issues.  I have tons of software for Windows systems that just won't work on a Mac, some of which don't even exist for the Mac (3D Studio Max).  Also, I'm really excited about Safari RSS.  And the new video formats.  And Spotlight.  And the video conferencing capabilities.  It's so amazing what Apple is doing.  I  really  want a Mac now.  You should watch the WWDC video.  It's long, but totally worth it.  peace out

      I have found several good sites for testing X/HTML pages in different browsers.  Here are the links:   Netscape Navigator   urlLink NN Archive  - contains versions 2-7 of NN.   Mozilla   urlLink Mozilla Downloads  - the most up-to-date versions of Mozilla's products.  urlLink Previous Versions  - contains versions 1.0 thru 1.8a1 for download.  urlLink The  Really  Old Versions  - here are versions previous to 1.0 (like, say, 0.6).   Internet Explorer   urlLink Latest Version  - most recent release of IE.  urlLink Standalone Versions  - IE dating back to dinosaurs (v3.0-5.5 sp2). Works best on XP. (Thx  urlLink Mark ).  If you know of any more/different/better sites, leave a comment.  This is just a little resource to help you out if you're ever wondering what your page looks like in old browsers.  //edit:  for a mac view, check here:  urlLink iCapture >

      I was taking time off of work today and managed to find myself at  urlLink 2A .  I got to thinking as I was working my way through the site about how important 2A used to be to me, and how they aren't so much now.  Back in the day (pssh, 2 years ago...) 2A was by far the best thing that I had ever seen.  Period.  It was prolly the reason I started doing flash, too.  But now after I've seen  urlLink such   urlLink amazing   urlLink things , 2A isn't that big of a deal.  It's like they want to be, but it's like they try too hard, and end up overdoing it all.  It's like they are the old school, with there 'super-cool' 25 milligram video that really rocked the industry when it came out.  But now it's like, yea, so what?  But really, don't get me wrong.  I love 2A's work, and they're still going strong after a lot of people have dropped out of the game.  Congratulations, 2A, for fueling today's amazingly talented individuals.  And for taking all the ripping gracefully.  peace out

      Wow, so much has happened since last night, or else it just feels like it.  This morning I went and got my driver's license, and passed on the first try.  The lady was really nice and told me I wasn't mergin right and told me how to do it the right way.  Really cool.  Also, last night some friends that are moving came over to say goodbye and I got into a conversation with them about the best way to buy the Mac.  He said that buying a computer is a process, and that it would be really smart to buy it in pieces.  So, I'm going to save up for the CPU which comes with a mouse and keyboard and just buy a cheap little CRT monitor and then start saving up for the monitor I really want (which is going to cost about $1000 I think...), the 23" HD Cinema Display (not the new one, the older one).  Then after that I'll buy either the wireless keyboard/mouse or get an Airport base depending on if we have DSL/Cable/Satellite by then.  Then I'll get the sound system last as I'm hoping to get a fairly good one.  If anyone knows a site for good cheap computer audio systems, please tell me about it.  To pay for all of this I'm saving all the money (got paid today!) from the internship, and *hopefully* getting a job at MegaByte, the "Apple Store" (really an authorized reseller).  That way I should be able to get employee discounts and I could keep that job part time during school.  There's something that I've been thinking about trying to get started.  Since freelance is so popular and there is so much good talent that is freelancing (I'm talking web, video, and print design) out there, why not make a freelancing design studio?  It would be really cool to have some sort of an agency that has contact with 30-50 freelancers and sets up jobs with them after the client contacts 'leaders'.  Put that way it sounds like some websites out there that already exist, but it would be different.  One advantage would be the ability to have so much talent in so many areas available to the clientele, therefore generating the best product.  Almost like a collaborative effort on a single project with people from all over the globe working through a chat room-like form of communication.  There would be no relocation necessary as it would be totally digital.  Many projects could be processed at the same time unlike a design studio with only 6 members.  I think it's a really cool idea, and I'd love to hear what everyone thought about it.  I'm really interested in getting this up and running no matter how many people would be interested or available right off the bat.  Give me a  urlLink shout  about what you think.  peace out :)

       urlLink Mike  finally has his server back, woo hoo.  His damn host is stupid and takes forever to respond but whatever.  Also, I've been made a moderator at BB forum.  Fun stuff.    The template work is going slow as ever.  I hate the fact that the previous designers were inexperienced and therefore there are 1,652 lines of HTML in one page I'm updating.  But I'm almost done with the first bit.  We got new kitties a couple days ago and they're being a little annoying.  Last night our oldest cat slept with me and woke me up at around 4 a.m. demanding to go out the open door of my room and be fed.  I don't feed the cats ever, so I just shut the door, locking him out of my room, but he scrathed up the carpet by my door and that woke me up.  So after an hour I was like fuck it and got up and threw him out the backdoor.  Literally.  So, overall I got like 4 hours of sleep last night, and I'm definitely feeling tired at work today.  C'est la vie.  The reason I went to bed at 12 last night was because I was watching the movie 'Heat' with DeNiro and Kilmer.  I absolutly  love  that movie to no end.  I started watching at 8, and finished (after numerous interruptions from the cats) at 11.30.  By the time I was ready to sleep, it was past midnight and I was pissed.  But, that's all good.  I'm fairly awake now, with pizza, coffee, and coke pumped into my veins.  But still, it's not a good thing when you wake up with a headache.  I need more sleep and less screen.  I'm keeping my tan from this fucking 20" lcd I live in front of.  Dammit.  peace out

      So over my extended lunch hour today I went and took a visit to the Apple Store.  (I didn't get my DL).  When we got there they had two Powermac G5s sitting there, being beautiful.  I got into this discussion with one of the guys there about basically everything, and I learned a lot, including that Photothop takes eleven seconds (one-one-thousand...) to start up.  That was really exciting.  I mean really.  And they had a widescreen (about 23" I think) that it was set up on.  The entire thing was gorgeous.  And the salesman did a really good job of selling me on the whole thing, even though all he did was say yes to all my questions.  I think that I've decided to go ahead and get a Mac when I've got the money.    Also something really amazing he showed off to me:  Exposé.  He opened up a ton of apps and then hit F9 and magically they all tiled together.  Amazing device there.  I was totally raving when I left.    Hehe, and I got two hang-up posters of the G5 and the Cinema Displays.  Woo hoo, I can hardly wait until August when I have the money for one.  *grin*  peace out

      I had quite a good time over the past weekend, and I hope everyone else did as well.  It was probably my very first 'sane' fourth, where I didn't get burned or stabbed with a PVC pipe (recalling last year when i nearly chopped my toe off with a pipe...)  At first I didn't think that I was going to do anything for the fourth, seeing as how I had/have no money, and that my parent's weren't home.  But then the neighbors got home and bought explosives and we had fun.  So today I'm going to go and take the driving test for my license (sp?).  I should do okay.  And then (the best part) we're going down to the Apple store and letting me see the pretty Macs.  I can't wait, it's gonna be sweet.    Random bits: I'm over 1000 posts @ BB in about 3 months.  Also, check  urlLink this  out, it's from  urlLink SRF.STN .  Funny as hell.  peace out :)

      Hmmm.. I've been terribly busy since last I posted.  I've worked on some more sites, which will be released soon.  And I've started production on my site.  Nothing fancy, but it's cool.    Got to talk with  urlLink Mike Minor  today.  Very great guy, super cool.  It was good to get back in touch with him.  Only $1000 away from the mac.  I should get some freelance to get there faster.  Also, new friends are listed at right.  Thanks for your support guys :)  peace out.

      So I took another trip to the Apple store Saturday.  I spent 2 hours there, and found out a lot more information regarding powermacs and their hardware.  I didn't know that there were two releases of them, a release A and release B.  The main differences between the two is that the low-end model was only a single processor, and the middle model was the dual 1.8 (which I want).  This is important because with the middle model you get more fun stuff, like an 8gb ram capacity, a 160gb hdd, and 3 pci-x slots.   A quick google on the matter produced  urlLink this :   Revision 1.0 of the PCI-X specification defined PCI-X 66 and PCI-X 133 devices that transferred data up to 133 MTS, or over 1Gbyte per second for a 64-bit device. The present revision adds two new speed grades: PCI-X 266 and PCI-X 533, offering up to 4.3 gigabytes per second of bandwidth, 32 times faster than the first generation of PCI. Another major feature of the PCI-X 2.0 specification is enhanced system reliability.  Sounds pretty cool, and I think I should investigate this more.  The only downside to the release A powermac is $200 more (for the store prices).  I think that that is a better thing to get however, because of the added features.    *Hopefully* I'm making a good decision on Apple.  It's an awful lot of money, and I could build a windows system for half as much.    One more thing:  I'm in a  urlLink battle  at BB.  It's fun ^__^  peace out :)

      First off, for all you loyal readers, I'm sorry it's been so long since I've updated.  Quite busy have I been.   Yesterday I took off work (and missed the AS conference) to go to the lake.  I had a lot of fun and spent probably eight full hours in the water.  I went sailing by myself on the little MX Ray ( urlLink click ) for the first time in a year and ooh it was sooo much fun!  I didn't capsize nearly as much as I thought I would (only 3 times near the end) considering the wind was so strong.  It was super annoying though because when I pulled the  urlLink spinnaker  the wind completely died and I drifted right into the shore near some dumb kids who were like 'Huh, what's that yellow thing Uncle Jim?'   We went out on the wooden boat for a good two hours and I burnt the tops of my knees something awful!  They really hurt but I  urlLink cbf  to put aloe on it.  Oh well, it'll heal.  It's not like I've never been burned before.   Also, I went buck-wild with my camera the other night and got some  urlLink pictures  that were pretty cool.  I used my step-dad's big-ass lantern and ran around in front of my camera on a tripod for 15 seconds.  Pretty fun blinding the neighbors at 10 o'clock p.m.   But I lost the original high-res of the ones I uploaded.  :(   One last thing - I'm in another  urlLink tennis  match @ BB.  Great fun, first time doing that sort.   Anyway, it's time to go home from work now.  Congrats to  urlLink Chris  and   urlLink David  for being so good at flash.  Props you guys.   -out

      You know that?  It really does....  grrr..  work?  i hate it.  you can't fucking imagine.  Not only am I sick of doing all these bullshit websites, I'm sick of having them picked to destruction by my boss.  But, what are boss's for, eh?  I'll be soooo happy when I get paid to be forced to change websites..  That'll be sweet.  So then enough rant.... My site is finally starting to come together.  It looks really nice, but sorry, there's no preview :P  So far I'm at 130 or so lines of AS, and there's still more to do.  Hopefully I'll be finished with it before school starts.   Ah.  School.  It starts in like 2 weeks.  As much as I want to see my friends, I really don't want to go back.  Just like every other summer, this one has whizzed by.  Fuck.  I hate work, I really do.  I love the money, but I hate the time it takes up.  grrrrr.  Maybe I could write the fucking government and they'd pay me for doing nothing.  But then again, maybe not.  Oohhhh.. it's nearly mac time!  This friday I'll have almost enough for the computer, and then after I sell some stuff I'll have enough for the mac, dual 17" LCDs that I found on eBay, and *hopefully* a desk and a light.   Bah.  I'm tired.  I'm cranky.  And, there's a big meeting on Friday that I haven't even thought about.  Grrrrrr.  Maybe I'll call in sick on Friday... yeees, that's the thing to do!  oh my, that was like one big entire bitch session.  Oh well...  sorry for not updating for so damn long.  peace out.

       I just tried Windows Longhorn beta 4051.  I got it off of  urlLink emule .  It is  *very*  ugly.  Longhorn is much more bloated than Windows XP (and I thought that was bad).  Windows Explorer in Longhorn has a large XP-style menu on the left side and a completely unnecessary menu under the toolbars.  Combined with the  *gigantic*  back and forward buttons that are permanently docked at the  /very/  top of the window, this leaves very little space for the actual file view.  To top it all off, the address bar is actually visible by default (was not in XP) but it looks horrific; yet it does have a semi-cool drop-down list for each directory/subdirectory.  The quicklaunch, system tray, and clock now reside in their own gigantic (~5-icon width wide) toolbar on the right side of the screen.  The clock is overly large.  When you click on the clock a much larger clock will popup.  The taskbar and new  ugly  sidebar take forever to load.  The sidebar can be minimized, but then there is no way to see your quicklaunch, system tray, and clock....  What a shame.

       Torrentz is a website that allows you to download just about anything you could want (legally or illegally) via Bitorrent.  Torrentz changed their homepage for about a week to notify their visitors that they would be down due to legal issues.  It appears now that Torrentz is down for good.  I will now have to rely on  urlLink www.suprnova.org ,  urlLink emule , and  urlLink StreamRipper .  What is piracy coming to?

       I currently know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript very well.   I usually end up looking up CSS commands and I have to refer to websites for some lesser-known JavaScript commands.  I also know Perl and some Visual Basic commands.  I can easily alter Perl scripts and I have made some of my own.  I do not know Perl very fluently but I know if well enough.  I only know some Visual Basic code because I have developed a few Visual Basic programs.  The VB project I am most proud of is  urlLink Network Message Send .  I currently know bits and pieces of Unix shell script, DOS, and any other language similar to the ones I already know.  I haven't been able to program and design much recently because I've been busy with school, swimming, water polo, and illness.  I am going to learn Java next year in a class in high school.  I am not too excited about learning Java but it is the only language they teach at my school besides Visual Basic.  I believe Java will not grow online anymore.  It is almost obsolete on the internet and the only place it is really used is cellphones.  I self-taught myself all of the other languages I know so I am not sure how they will teach the course and if it will be easier to learn from an instructor.

        urlLink GeeXBox  is a Linux distro meant to be used to allow any computer to become a home entertainment system.  I found out about GeeXBox when it was in its 0.9 stage.  It was alright back then but it had some bugs and was a bit glitchy.  GeeXBox 0.97 is out now and it is incredible!  GeeXBox has TV-out support, support for common controllers, the ability to find and play any shared media on the network, an internal FTP server to allow anyone on the network to remote the file system, and support for  many  different media formats.  Many settings in GeeXBox can be customized by Windows or Linux users by downloading the ISO generator and changing/replacing files before the ISO is re-created.  I have created two Matrix-style themes for GeeXBox that can be found on  urlLink GeeXdB.net .  I am planning to build a shuttle box this summer that I will hook into our TV and stereo system.  The video card will have to have SVIDEO support and will probably some kind of nVidia.  The sound card will need to be very good.  512MB RAM should be good.  GeeXBox is live-cd based so it loads itself into RAM on boot and I want to be able to cache as much of the movie I am watching as possible.  The CPU does not need to be fancy; just as much as a DVD requires.  The motherboard should have USB 2.0 support (I believe it is standard anyways).  The motherboard does not need built-in audio or video; however a built-in NIC would be nice.

       Blogger's new features and new look is awesome and everyone seems to be loving it.  One thing that Blogger is still missing though is a way for users to customize their RSS feeds more.   (For those of you who don't know what RSS is check out  urlLink What is an RSS Feed?  and  urlLink Introduction to RSS ) .  Users of Blogger can currently edit their website template and the HTML code in their posts but they do not have the ability to alter their RSS feed in any way.  Blogger probably does this so people cannot mess up their RSS feed and render it useless.  A good way for Blogger to allow editing is to allow users to add some extra select tags to their feed to allow some more flexiblity.  The RSS tags are really the only thing that need editing.  The reason I thought of this is because I recently licensed my blog under a  urlLink Creative Commons  license to allow people to re-distribute my work, make derivative works from it, and even sell my work as long as they give me credit for it and license their work under the same Creative Commons license.  This allows the words I am writting here to be heard legally by means of   open-source-like   redistribution.  Anyways, after licensing my work I found that I could put a few tags into my RSS feed and people would know, if they accessed my blog via the feed, that the work was still licensed under the Creative Commons license.  I then realized that there was no way for me to edit the feed without logging into my server and manually editing it.  Blogger doesn't currently allow users to edit their feeds in  any  way  My idea for Blogger is to create a few form fields (HTML input boxes) to allow users to add the correct tags to their document to inform users about the licensing information of their feed.  Each post should have its own licensing tag (which will proabably be the same for all posts).  An example of the licensing tag is:    &lt;cc:License rdf:about="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"&gt;    The whole blog should also have some other tags in it to denote what rights the reader has.  More information about denoting a creative commons license in an RSS 1.0 feed can be found at  urlLink RDF Site Summary 1.0 Modules: mod_cc .

       I discussed the algorithm one would use to convert decimal to binary.  I decided that it would probably be easiest to start of with a simple method simlar to this:   $decnum = &lt;STDIN>; # get input from the user while($decnum    for ($x = 1; $x    # find the largest number that where { log(x)/log(2) = W (W is a whole number) }     $maxnum = $x;   }   $decnum -= $maxnum; # subtract the binary-based num. we have so we can loop   push (@onevals, $maxnum); # store the binary-based num. for later use  } $currentnum = shift(@onevals); # get the largest binary-based num. we put in storage $binarynum = "1"; # add a 1 in front (this is our starting point)  for($x = 1; $x    $binarynum .= "0"; }  while(@onevals) { # add all the ones in the right spots   $currentnum = shift(@onevals); # find the next largest binary-based number   $binarynum ~= /0(0{log($currentnum - 1)})$/; # find where the next one should go   $binarynum = $` . 1 . $1; # add the one in there } print "$decnum in binary is: $binarynum"; # print the result   Please realize that this code was just written off the top of my head and I haven't even tried it yet.  Perl is almost never bug-free for me the first time.  Its the basic idea though.

        if( $fed_trouble )  {  print "It wasn't be";  &crash;  }    urlLink This Slashdot article  poses the idea of opening up your wireless LAN to the world so that you can do what you like and claim it was a neighbor or a  urlLink wardriver .  On our home wireless firewall we have MAC address restriciton and a DHCP setup.  Both of these would have to be turned off to allow outsiders (and you) to access your LAN and anonymously use it.  This would allow people to ruin your bandwidth; plus I doubt the authorities would believe that you didn't know what you were doing.

       I haven't posted in a while.  I've been posting to p2p galore some recently.  I just realized how easy it is to download episodes of CSI or one of those other investigating-type shows.  I can get the newest CSI espisode recorded from an HDTV in an hour or two via bittorrent.  I use  urlLink SharpReader  to see when my favorite (blogs && news sites && torrent site && other RSS-supported sites) are updated.

       To re-program the game Pong you need to consider a few basic variables.  The speed of the ball must be kept constant and the slope of the ball must change accordingly when a ball hits an object.  The actual slope of the line that the ball is traveling in can be determined by the  urlLink Pythagorean theorem :  A 2  + B 2  = C 2  .  A is the change in the X axis per millisecond, B is the change in the Y axis per millisecond, and C is the slope of the line.  When the ball hits a flat surface the slope must change to allow the direction of the ball to change.  When the ball hits a horizontal flat surface the change in Y must become negative and the change in X must stay the same.  When the ball hits a vertical flat surface the change in X must become negative and the change in Y must stay constant.  A more accurate game of Pong would include other variables such as a change in slope according to the velocity of the paddle at the moment that it hit the ball and where the ball hit the paddle (the edge or the center).  These factors would change the velocity of the ball and would make the game more interesting, however they require much more math.   The previous post was posted from my cell phone while I was at school.  I text messaged an email address that can be used to post to my blog.  I thought of the ideas behind the making of Pong today after my friend asked how you would go about programming a game of Pong.

       I'm getting ready for a switch to Linux.  This time it will be fairly permanent (I hope).  I switched to Linux last winter break for about two weeks.  I was using SuSE 9.0 then.  I got into making  urlLink FreeSoftwareReviews  and I needed to use Windows to review software.  I kind of got stuck in it after finding some new software and leaving my Linux distros to obsolete themselves.  I'm debating about which Linux distro to use as my main system.  I have a ridiculous amount of hard drives and I'm hoping to buy two more this summer.  I use a  urlLink Lian Li removable hard drive bay  with 8 removable hard drive drawers.  At the moment my hard drive status is: [Windows 2000/98 (120gb)], [Slackware 9.1 (8gb)], [Mandrake 9.2/Slackware 9.? (80gb)], [Mandrake 10 (8gb)], [SuSE 9.0 (80gb)], [Longhorn (120gb)], [no OS (300mb)], [empty drive drawer], [empty drive drawer].  I think I might try Linspire (aka Lindows), Fedora Core 2 this summer (I tried Fedora Core 1 already).  I think I will be switching to either Mandrake 10, SuSE 9.1, or Slackware 9.1.  I had a little crashing problem in Mandrake 10 (probably because I multi-tasked a  little  too much).  I would love to switch to Slackware permanently but I'm not very familiar with updating my system regularly, patching it myself and such.  If there was a service I could use to do this while in Slackware (or a website that recommends what to update frequently) I may give it a try.  If Fedora Core 2 impresses me more than Core 1 did, I may even switch to it.  Any suggestions are welcome (*hint hint*).

       I changed the name of this blog to chmod 311 because I think it suites the blog and my life in general well.  For those of you who have never had to change file permissions on a Unix-based system,  chmod  is a command that alters read/write/execute permissions of a file according to the user, group, and the rest of the world.  The basic system for changing permissions is based on numbers.   1  represents read permissions,  2  represents write permissions, and  4  represents execute permissions.    The basic file permissions chart:       user  group  everyone     read   1    1    1      write   2   2  3     execute  4  4  4     Most of the files I deal with, including many of the files on my harddrive can be read and written by me and can be seen by the whole world.  In this way I can share many different files and allow others to use them yet keep people from changing those files on my computer.  (This is how it works on most p2p clients)

       I  urlLink switched to Fedora Core 2 (Linux) a while back  and I'm still using it.  It seems like each time I install a new system I get more and more things to work correctly and I learn how to overcome more and more obstacles.  Windows hackers/techies have to perform tasks to overcome obstacles all the time, but they are usually very different obstacles than the ones you find in Linux.  I have ran into many problems so far in Linux and overcome quite a few.  A few of the problems I have run into so far include:     lack of Cannon i950 printer drivers installing a printer attached to another machine (Windows) on the network   uncorrupting amule (emule for Linux)   getting sound to work after breaking it, installing a new Window Manager (IceWM)   finding various dependencies for various programs   making my own shell scripts    I have overcome most of these problems.  I just bought Slackware 10 (it was really free with $6 shipping) and I am hopping to switch sometime soon.  I need to set some goals to accomplish before I feel that I can switch.  I want to be able to compile and install a new kernel, and keep up-to-date on various other software easily.

       I recently noticed that since G4 and TechTV have merged many of Kevin's dark tips have been transferred but an archive for them has not been made.  I started an archive of them yesterday.  I used this opportunity to test out the use of very simple HTML and multiple style sheets.  I used javascript to change the style sheet and save/load the user's last style sheet in their cookies.  I experimented with floating DIVs, creating content before and after commands and many other cool CSS tricks.  The archive is licensed under a very non-restricting Creative Commons license (as expected) and I'll change the archive if you contact me about it.  Oh.... and I also made an RSS feed for it from scratch.   urlLink Unofficial Dark Tips Archive

       I finally switched to Linux.  I installed Fedora Core 2 last friday night and I loaded all of my music, family photos, and other important documents onto Fedora by Sunday.  I am using an 80gb hard drive which is sufficient for now even though I had almost a completely full 120gb one for Windows.  The games and programs for Linux tend to take up less space and I don't need as many of them.  I have a Microsoft Wireless Natural Multimedia keyboard.  It is a nice keyboard besides the fact that it has an "F Lock" key that has to be pressed "on" before the function keys (F1 - F12) can be used.  I used to use a Windows regsitry hack that fixed this by changing all of the keycodes of the new and useless functions of the F keys (like print, reply, save) to act as if they were the normal F keys.  Now that I am using Linux I had to get used to pressing that dumb "F Lock" key again.  I got sick of it so I made a shell script that fixes the problem.  The script is available and licensed under the  urlLink GPL .  The script is:  urlLink f_lock_fix

       Microsoft officially patented the double-click.  What has this world come to?  An "Anonymous Coward" on Slashdot claims that the double-click was first made by aliens before Microsoft.  I don't know if I would go that far, but I am sure it was used before Microsoft was ever thought of.   Quoting   urlLink Microsoft Receives Patent For Double-Click   Could mere humans have thought up the concept of clicking twice!

Alternative application functions are launched based on the length of time an application button is pressed. A default function for an application is launched if the button is pressed for a short, i.e., normal, period of time. An alternative function of the application is launched if the button is pressed for a long, (e.g., at least one second), period of time. Still another function can be launched if the application button is pressed multiple times within a short period of time, e.g., double click.

       About two weeks ago I made a Perl script that traps malicious bots (specifically spambots) that visit a website using the script, clutters the spambots email lists with an infinite amount of randomly generated email addresses, and blocks the bot from the web server. I am hosting the scripts on Sourceforge under the name  urlLink SandTrap .  I am hoping that the script will be used on at least a few servers and that some perl/CGI junkies might help touch it up a little eventually.  The website for SandTrap is not functional at the moment but the layout is done.  The full website will eventually be at  urlLink sandtrap.sourceforge.net .

I hope to make a nice little page for these wallpapers that shows a thumbnail, picture name, resolution, and picture taker.  Right now the page is hosted on my 1GB Oktagone server but I hope to move it to my friend's 1GB Powweb server once he gives me all of his pictures from the trip also.   urlLink   Wallpapers Page

          Še štiri dni do vstopa Slovenije v EU! MMM. Proslavljali bomo!!!!!  S kolegom sva začela nov projekt, ki pa je še trenutno skrivnost. Zelo aktivno pa se učim gtkmm programiranje.

       Že cel teden me je veselje. Namestil sem si slackware 9.1 in naložil dropline gnome 2.6. Moram rečt da i vse dela, kot bi moralo delati. Res čudovito. Poleg tega je izšel gcc 3.4. Ima kup novosti in preizkusno novost - "precompiled headers". Zaglavja so že prevedena, kar pomeni hitrejše prevajanje kode :))  Odločil sem se, da bom pri l4xml uporabljal garbage collector. Moram ga še samo vgraditi, kar je pa teoretično zelo preprosto.

       Dolgčas ... Pa še dolgčas ......  Posodobil sem stran :). Novi članki in celo spremenjena uvodna slika. Doživel sem veliko srečo, saj je izšel GNOME 2.6. Kar hitro kompajlat! Sicer se pa ni nič dogajalo.   Se je pa nekaj časa dogajala debata med Miguelom de Icazo in Havocom Penningtonom(dva pomembna tipa pri GNOME projektu). Debatirala sta, ali naj bo GNOME jedro v naslednjih verzijah napisano v drugem jeziku in kerem. Konkretno je bilo govora o Javi in C#(oz. .NET). Miguel je podpiral C#, Havoc pa Javo. Slednji je tudi predlagal, naj ostane tako kot je oz. naj se raje uporabi nek bolj odprti jezik. Konkratno C++. Jaz sem pravtako za slednje.   MOJE SOŽALJE GNOME TEAMU ZA IZGUBO TREH IZVRSTNIH GNOME HEKERJEV! VSAKA JIM ČAST!!!

       Pogledal sem si en dolgi filmček, ki kaže dva Microsoftova razvijalca Avalon in XAML tehnologij. Stvar je precej zanimiva. Gradnja grafičnih vmesnikov preko mešanja XML dokumentov in C# programov je zelo domiselno. Nekaj podobno XAML je sicer že. Imenuje pa se XUL, ki ga uporablja Mozilla.org.

       Zadnje dni sem bolj len.  Malo preizkušam Hans-Boehm garbage collector. S Slackware sem res zadovoljen in še vedno delam v C/C++, kjub močnim pritiskom .NET optimistov ;)  Naprej se še učim GTKmm programiranje.

      Wow. Im pretty amased how much people are using c#. Some news is out that Sun will open-source Java. Now that's great news!  In other, nothing new has happened. I must start to code now, really I must. Still have some work to d with l4xml.

      For now on I will post in english so all the world get's my message. I will also post some pictures that I have made with my cell phone.  I am thinking to begin some GNOME hacking but that's kinda hard becose GNOME is written in C and gtk+. But I know only GTKmm and not GTK+. Muust find some GNOME projects build with GTKmm.  Also sown a MSDN TV movie that shows some cool XAML and Avalon features. Windows Longhorn will bi pretty cool. Maybe I'll use it but still be a Linux developer :--)

      Well, I have opened a discussion on the s-linux forum about .NET, mono and stuff. Mainly, all the participians agree that .NET is dangeorus and good. I rather program in C than C#, althought C# is a very interesting language.  I played a bit with socket programming. Trying to write a small IRC client. But it fails to register to the IRC network. Really don't know why.

      Finally I have my own Linux server. It can be accessed through different domains: napsy.mozirje.net, sfinga.no-ip.com (the orig. server name), luka-napotnik.no-ip.com. It's an old mashine with somehow defective RAM so the kernel goes often in panic.     Monday I will start my summer job as a gtkmm programmer :) In other news lately I played a lot Enemy Territory. Great game! And Monday I thing I'm gonna to buy myself a big, jucy PIZZA!!!

      Today I played a little with gtkmm. Now I know how communication between different windows goes. It's so simple ;).   I am working on the team project. I don't have a name right now but it has something to do with XML-RPC and project management :--). First I have to write the basic operations like task adding, editing and deleting. Then it's time tor saving functions, etc. When I'm done with that, I'll do the "real bussiness". Like sending rpc commands to a remote server, sharing XML documents, opening remote XML documents, etc.  What am I doing now: have some problems refreshing the TreeView widget. But I think I already know what to do. But now it's time to sleep. ZzZzz ...

      Dear Friends  I'm tired of my opinions being tolerated. I'm tired of being told that I'm different but tolerable. And I'm shooting the next person who tells me I have "an interesting way of viewing things.” I would rather have somebody say 'you're wrong and this is why' than 'I'm not sure if I agree but I guess your opinion makes sense from your point of view.” It's like it completely contradicts society to be 'right' or ‘wrong’… and all we have left is the grays and maybes.  A society as a whole has retreated into a shell of protection known as euphemism, and that shell protects us from learning anything. Want to live on the edge? Does your life lack excitement? That feeling will stay no matter what you do, until you have the courage to tell the world, 'no, you're wrong.’ And then prove it. So when I finish this article, tell me I'm wrong. Or tell me I'm right and you agree and you feel the same rage at political correctness that permeates our world, but don't tell me my opinion is a good one and has its merits.  Here's an encouragement to any who feel that they've lived life in a box too long. Start seeing absolutes. People these days have learned only to memorize, and not to think. Think for yourself, and you'll go somewhere. That's what makes somebody an individual.  That's all. Hope it wasn't too angsty.  Dan

      Dear Friends  I can't tell you how many times I've complained about holidays only to be told that I should be thankful for what I have, and this phenomenon never more acute than around Thanksgiving. I'd like to debunk that thrice-accursed philosophy, but I'm afraid die-hard optimists permeate the world, so I'll simply have my say and hope people will listen.  Possession is relative, just like everything else. A person's status quo- that is, the way they are- is the baseline for possession, and as such there is no 'galactic standard' for whether somebody is poor. The beggar in the street is as used to his condition as I am to mine. The exception is the addition of permanent discomforts of the physical senses in the extreme. For instance, repeated instances of nearly freezing to death, constant agonizing hunger, or parching thirst. These things, since one cannot become 'accustomed' to them, denote a person as poor.  Now I can't see how 'remembering all the things I have to be thankful' is going to make me a better person. Given it's a good idea to keep in mind how blessed one is- and this is coming from a teenager particularly blessed- but at the same time I refuse to be dragged down by guilt over the advantages I've been gifted with in life. When people tell me, 'how dare you be depressed with everything you've got,’ my answer is 'because teenagers all over the world struggle with it and I value my sense of community'. Which is a load of bull, of course, but it counters a thoroughly sentimental and hence useless idea with another of the same sort.  Just so that I can pretend that this blog will be productive in some way, let me encourage you never to settle for less.  Never take less than what you can have for the sake of guilt.  As long as you keep in mind that giving is more beneficial to you than taking, that approach will take you far in life.  My civic duty being done, I’ll leave now :)  Dan

      Dear Friends  We all need something to believe in. I understand and empathize with that, but at the same time cannot bring myself to condone the casual acceptance of loose theory that surrounds the concept of love. It's like a song by Joe Eisenbrahm: "Is love until I die just love until I change my mind?" Love forever and always has not just lost its meaning. It never had it in the first place.  I'm a Christian, so I'm going to quote the bible. If you don't believe this stuff then skip this paragraph but Christian or not I'm guessing you'll agree. The bible says: "there is no greater love than this; that a man give his life for his friends." I want to avoid tangents but still I should point out that the quote does not necessitate death, only sacrifice of one's life- which could be time, energy, or money. The point is, love is characterized not by words, but by action. Your significant other can tell you "I love you" a million times, but if you notice that they're starting to gaze at other men/women and they haven't done anything special for you in a while, doubt is inevitable.  So if love- and you must understand that I speak of love in the generic sense, not necessarily romantic love- is characterized by action, what is the most accurate measure? To ask the question: what would you DO for them? From there, the logic is elementary.  I would die for any of my friends in a heartbeat. I'd like to think, though obviously I've never been put to the test, that I would die for a common man on the street that I'd never met. Sacrifice is a key aspect in how I express my love. So here's the clincher: what more is there to give? I would give up anything for my friends, and there's simply nothing more to sacrifice for a girl. I can give more of my time, or more of my energy, but the bottom line is that the difference is quantitative, not qualitative.  I believe strongly in the love of friendship. I also believe that the 'romantic love' that everybody is so enraptured by is simply an array of different components that people have massed together over the years: friendship, attraction, and a mutually exclusive commitment. I include friendship because it incorporates the necessities of a relationship, like respect, trust, sincerity, etc. Attraction is necessary because otherwise.. well, you see what I mean. The commitment is what really sets it apart. A mutually exclusive commitment says, "You are first and foremost mine, as I am first and foremost yours." And here's the kicker: since dating and courting don't inherently indicate any sort of permanence, the ONLY place 'romantic love' can in ANY way occur is INSIDE THE CONTEXT OF MARRIAGE. That's somewhat irrelevant but all the same I thought it worth mentioning.  Some of you sentimentalists (I don't mean that as a derogatory statement since I'm one too) are bound to think, love can't be 'defined,' love is a feeling that____ you fill in the blank. I disagree strongly. The whole 'indescribable' cliché is really an excuse to avoid looking into difficult emotions. Humans aren't all that complicated, and I can see no reason why love should be this hovering complexity that some view it as.  I'll be interested in what people have to say about this one.

      Dear Friends  I'm not new at this.  I came from JoeUser.com, a quickly growing community of bloggers.  As long as I'm setting out to maintain a reputation of honestly, I may as well tell you that I got kicked out.  The admins got horribly ticked off- and Brad, the owner, isn't generally a guy that loses his cool- and I am now exiled.  It goes without saying that I consider his decision unwarranted, but I'm also a teenager, and we all know how  that  goes:)  For a while, I'll probably post the best of the best from my old blog.  Hopefully, by the end I'll have made enough local friends to begin posting articles that fit into the kind of demography that people read here.  Enough of an intro for now.  Blog in peace.

      "Homosexuality is never mentioned explicitly by any character save when Gene says that Finny’s pink shirt makes him look like a “fairy.” But the relationships in the book are all between boys (we never see them interact with girlfriends or mothers, except for one brief scene with Leper’s mother), and the central relationship contains hints of an almost sexual attraction between Gene and Finny. When the boys go to the beach, for instance, Gene remarks that his friend’s skin “radiated a reddish copper glow of tan, his brown hair had been a little bleached by the sun, and I noticed that the tan made his eyes shine with a cool blue-green fire.” Although the language is not expressly homoerotic, Gene’s words suggest that the connection between him and Finny is, if not sexual, then at least strongly physical: the boys direct their affection toward each other’s whole beings, increasing the intensity of their bond."

      Hmm...Havnt posted in a while. Here goes.  Well. Mr. Menser (Oops, did i just say Mr? Oh well.) decided that she was going to give the entirety of the other art class detention because they all failed the test. Ok, wtf? (Assuming that she gave them proper notes, but she DIDN'T.) It would be THEIR fault for failing. The F is punishment enough. Ok, now on the fact that she DID NOT give them/us proper notes. BTW, my class all failed the test too. We got the same notes, but no detention.     Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on ya nipples Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle Got 'em under control, the bowl of tender biddles Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles Just play a little "D" and I'll make ya mouth dribble Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not whiffle Hit 'em in triples, wit no strikes, stripes, or whistles I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, wit a ghetto tempo I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again My eyes chinky, I'm wit Chingy, at the Holidae In  Legendary words, from the Ludacris Ludacris.

      Alright. I wrote this in Geometry, so that I could cheer myself up. It's kinda long, so you might want to go pee...or grab a snack...or some popcorn. Here goes:  Only In Dreams - Weezer  From what  I  can see, our gereration is a generation fo dreamers. Basically, everyone claims that they have something that they dont. I.E. - "My uncle works for the CIA."  "I got a 35 on the ACT". I, for one, am tired of the damn lies. Be yourself. Don't pretend that you are something that you are not. I hear a constant stream of BS flowing from people's mouths wherever I go. - The one exception to this, is Dani. I'm not going to go get mushy, cause that would be kinda off topic, but, she doesnt bs me all the time. I admire that SO much it's not even funny. Back to the rant - I am an honest person as much as I possibly can be, whenever I can be. I'm not saying that I'm a saint, cause everyone fucks up somewhere along the line, but at least I try. My life has NOT been all that great...but it hasn't been all that bad. Just...average. Out of 46 people in our grade, I'm ranked 26th as far as grades go. Average. On my PSAT (Doesnt matter, but ok...) I got a 46 in math, a 51 in writing, and a 48 in writing skills. Average. I'm fscking DYING to find something that I'm good at. I'm (contrary to popular belief) NOT that good at video games. I'm NEVER the best person at a game...and I use strategy guides cause i'm a perfectionist. Sides, being good at video games isnt exactly appealing in the job market of today. I'm going to do something. Something that sets me apart from the swarm. Another thing that pisses me off. When people complain about grades 90% and up. STFU. It's an A. They dont give a damn about your number grade on your transcript, they just write down the letter.  So, if you could, I'd like to know what i'm good at.  E-mail me...I would tell you to put it in my tagboard...but I forgot where the code was to put one in.  Thank you,  Nick. (not frankie)

      Do you know a story that goes like this? There once was a tiger-striped cat. This cat died a million deaths and was reborn a million times and was owned by various people who he didn't really care for. The cat wasn't afraid to die... One day, the cat was a free cat, a stray cat. He met a white female cat, and the two cats spent their days happily together. Years passed, and the white cat was taken away from him. The tiger-striped cat cried a million times, and then he died. But this time, the cat was not reborn.

      Note on the last post - I may be just an assuming little dumbass. I dont know. But, it's my nature to think the worst...so..yeah  What the hell? It's cool. I dont need to know what goes on in the house that I live in. It's not like i live here or anything. I'm tired of all the shit that goes on in my house. Even chris noticed it when he came over. He was like "Ok, wtf? Your house seems like it would be a TENSE place to live in." Everyone in this house keeps things from one another. I always try to tell everyone where I'm going, and what I'm doing. No one EVER bothers to tell me these things. Is that too much to ask? To know where the people that you live with are? I'm tired of the bs that adam does, too. I ask him, "Hey, what's that?", and he's looking at a piece of paper, or reading a book, and he replys with a sassy "Nothing, nick, absolutely nothing." Then, in my head, i'm thinking to myself, "what the hell? what was that for?" then I go on and try to think of what I did to deserve it. At least, that's what I used to do. Now I've realized that adam is a fucking little prick. That NEVER thinks of anyone but himself. Same thing goes with his damn mother. Never anyone but ADAM, she thinks about. She thinks about/does things for adam more than she does things/thinks about my dad!!!! What the!?!? No WONDER adam's a spoiled little bitch. No WONDER he never does his homework. His mom always does it for him. The SECOND he gets into college, (knowing him, he'll end up in an ivy league, sheerly by mooching on his mom) he's going to flunk. He never does anything for himself. I always see victoria reading the books that he needs to read for a project, and writing notes down. Sometimes, she writes the ENTIRE paper for him! All he has to do is type it, and he complains! God damnit. I hate him. I hate the way he looks. I hate the way he talks. I hate the way he walks. I hate the way he treats people.  I really shouldnt be talking about the way he treats people. I'm just as much of a jackass. I talk about things to people that shouldnt know these things.    Are you listening?  [/life]  (In case anyone is thinking that I'm gonna take a knife to my wrist, or sport a spiffy russian necktie, no worries, I'm too much of a pansy to off myself.)

If you'll have me, I swear, I'll never...never...never do anything like that again....  I close my eyes and I keep seeing things Rainbow waterfalls Sunny liquid dreams Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt Gotta get to you But I don't know how Call me call me Let me know it's alright Call me call me Don't you think it's 'bout time Please won't you call and Ease my mind Reasons for me to find you Peace of mind What can I do To get me to you....

      VacantSilhouette: This is just fscking weird. VacantSilhouette: My folks came home, and victoria saw her foot lotion or whatever sitting out. AnorexicSwan: what VacantSilhouette: She came in, and said "have you been using my foot lotion" and i said "no" AnorexicSwan: lol VacantSilhouette: I've been sitting on my ass, playing video games the entire time that they've been gone. VacantSilhouette: Oh yeah, and i went to the living room to watch csi for an hour. VacantSilhouette: Then they started yelling at me. VacantSilhouette: I was like "WTF!??!" AnorexicSwan: Ugh, I'm sorry VacantSilhouette: Leave me alone! VacantSilhouette: The funny thing to do, would be to say, ok, you think i used that? come here, smell my hands, feet, and underwear. If you can find traces of hand lotion, then i'll pay you. I'll fscking PAY YOU. AnorexicSwan: lol AnorexicSwan: Yeah.. AnorexicSwan: wait.. AnorexicSwan: Oh..gross. VacantSilhouette: Yeah, you caught the underwear part? VacantSilhouette: Yes. VacantSilhouette: I'm sure that's what they were thinking. VacantSilhouette: I'm gonna kill em.  Seriously. I didn't. I swear to god. I've been playing video games/watching CSI the entire time they were gone. There was NO forearm exercise.      Anyways, on another note. I was VERY angry today. VERY angry. What about, you ask? Life. All aspects of it, but i'm not going to go into that. You can ask me IRL if you wish, i might explain it. I decided to ride my bike. I havnt ridden my bike in a while, but it's basically the equivalent of a punching bag to me. This time, i was really mad. I live on 38th and Western. I rode my bike to 70th and western. Yeah, i was pissed. Then i rode my bike back to my house, decided i wasnt quite ready to go in yet, and rode my bike to super cao nguyen. I was really thirsty by this time. I was PLANNING on going inside, and getting a drink or something. But nooooo. I forgot my wallet. Damnit. No passion-fruit green tea for me. Or fizzy drink. Or Sarsi. I really wanted a sarsi....

      Damn, i'm getting the feeling of uselessness again. I guess i'll resume my quest for the thing that i'm good at. I havnt found it yet. I think that i make people smile, but...i dont see how that can be related to a career. Unless i'm a clown. Clowns dont get paid well. Especially Ass-Clowns. I couldnt become a pro-comedian, because there are times when I cant think of SHI* when i'm improving/reciting. Uh...If I was a doctor i would get sued for something or the other. I'd probably crack jokes about smoking/blondes to the blonde cancer patients...Yeah, i'm that odd. Hmmm...Anything else? I could become a webcomic artist, but that doesnt get the $. At all. Cept for piro, but he doesnt count. That lazy mofo. lol. I could become a pool cleaner. But i'd pour arsenic or cyanide into people's pools for fun...How about a psychologist? no...malpractice suit. I'd make fun of people on my lunch break. I'm sorry if I cant keep a straight face when someone tells me that they have a crooked penis (Yes, that was a reference from the movie "cheaters". Damn you Napplebee!!!). Or when they tell me that their wife wants in the @$$, and that they are afraid of diseases and such. Or when they tell me that their grandma beat them as a teenager (They could have fought back...Old lady...Take a baseball bat to her hip.) Or when they tell me that they are deathly afraid of TPS reports (Office Space Reference). Or their boss. Or if they tell me that they want to swim in a sea of penii (South park reference). Or when they tell me that their computer told them to follow the white rabbit (Matrix Reference. Duh.). Well, i'm going to stop this now. All of the fragments are giving me a headache. ....  Wtf? eric's doing pushups in the middle of my room. I'm scared...he was just taking a nap. Bye.

      !!!  Crystal Chronicles! Adam's a biotch! Why, why didnt he get it??!? He lost his gameboy!??!? tough! Find it, bitch. Suffer for your mistake. In the meantime, i'll play ff:CC!  Well, instead of going in half-sies on FF:CC, cause adam's a bitch, i bought Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It's a pretty fun game. I AM the dark side. ph33r m4 wr4th. *Uses choke* Whaddyathinkofmenow, biatch! I just pwnzed an entire sith academy. Those biotches were annoying. There were like, 50 of them. Me with my puny-ass droids couldnt do anything against them...But then i used "drain life" and "Force Lightening", and everything was better. All was well. UNTIL THERE WERE 50 MORE. And i had no force left!!! I still pwnzed, cause i whipped out my double-sided lightsaber, and fscking pwnzed. After that, i went up into my ship, for a nice ride to tatooine to check and see if it was destroyed, and then darth malak's wench, mr. whatever, decided that he was going to use his tractor beam, and pull me into his ship. He's a tough mofo...He really is. He's got like 4 Dark Jedi guarding him...And he's got that BFG. I died, and i forgot to save, so i'm a ways back from there,  but i can get back...no problem.

        You belong in another of my worlds. The world of self-destructive tendencies, either through actual physical destructiveness or emotional breakdowns that you keep bottled up inside, thus hurting yourself. You feel that life is nothing but pain, and you see red in everything with the memories of the blood you have bled(literally or figuratively) for your hurting. You live in a hidden land that few will ever understand or see in you, because you keep it to yourself and only let a few rare people into the truth of your reality. Er...I don't condone my own actions, so I really don't know what else to say. Of course, you could also just REALLY like blood....or you might be homicidal, not suicidal. ^_^;    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I guess those results are right.

      Up and outward to find...  Well, this is great. One of my old friends from cha, my grandma has just informed me, has been diagnosed with lymphoma. He's a really cool guy...I hope he makes it. Why couldnt one of the bastards/bitches of the world contracted it instead? I mean, if the reaper's just getting bored, kill off a few old people. Or a few assholes.

      The interesting events of my day...  11:25-1:25 pm - Well, i got bored. To say the least. Mrs. Swagerty had a bottle of "Astec-Drink" sitting up on top of her filing cabnet. It had been there all year, so one could come to the conclusion that she was not planning on consuming it. I "borrowed" her drink, and furrer/dani/parker/me decided to take the liberty of partaking in the fermented squeezed-sixth graders. They were quite tasty. My companion furrer and I walked back to the HS, and refilled the bottle with an automobile anti-freeze mixture that was neon-green in color. Then I placed the bottle back where I borrowed it from. Now, Furrer/Parker/I thought that it was going to take her a couple of days to notice it, but she almost immediately noticed the un-natural substance, and knew instaniously that it was either furrer or I. Because we enjoy playing practical jokes on the english kook. At first, i thought that she was going to suspend or expell me, but it turns out that she can take a joke.  1:30 - 6:00 pm - My Dad and I went for a drive. First, we stopped at city bites because he hadn't taken the liberty to partake in his noon-time nutrition meal. Soon after, we drove to the optomitrist because I had not had my eyes checked in a few years, so I needed to check if i was blind or not. Turns out, that the stigmatism in my right eye has become worse, and my left eye's vision has grown worse. Oh well. Time heals all wounds...(wtf? that saying doesnt work). We payed the sadistic-nurse lady that was wearing a pentagram, and then we went next door to find me a new pair of spectacles. Me, being a geek, immediatly went to the "matrix" line of glasses, and picked out what I wanted. Only $70. The glasses would take an hour or two to make, so my dad and I went to run a couple more errands. We first walked to "Guitar Center" which has a lot of musical instruments/audio supplies. We went there because my dad needed a "Midi +" cable.  My dad psyched out the geeks at GC when he asked for it, they all had the general expression of "wtf is that?" They didnt have it, so we went to check at Best Buy. Yeah. Right. Like best buy would have ANYTHING remotely useful besides video games. I saw a few middle-school astecians...They didnt acknowledge me...i didnt acknowledge them, typical astecian meeting. My dad and I got bored, so we went back to check on my glasses 30 minutes early. For some reason or another, they were finished. When i put them on, i walked around, and ran into a few things. Damn depth perception. Fix yourself. We then went to audio dimensions to check on the 38 inch tv that would be going into my room when it was repaired. My dad had aquired it from a customer that claimed "Yeah, it works fine, I just havnt used it for 2 years." Oh well. The joke was on him. It cost $180 to repair, and new, it cost $900. We couldnt pick up the tv, of course, because we dont have the $ to pay for it right now, but it will be mine soon...After that, we went to one of the famly friend's house. Well. Soon-to-be house. They just bought it, but it's a "fixer-upper". By "fixer-upper", i mean POS. But, the support is still mostly intact, so it'll become a good house. The man that used to star on the show "Sheriff Bill" lived there. When they found him, he had been buying cases of jack daniels, drinking all the liquer in the bottle, and then pissing in the bottle, and laying the bottle to the side. Needless to say, he didnt maintain the building very well. On the way out, my dad started talking about some chili that tammy made. (we were at ken and tammy's house). My dad had some...problems with that chili. Then, he started talking about how him and victoria were having sex, and then the chili started acting up...*shudders* DAD! I DONT WANT TO HEAR THESE THINGS! DAMN YOU TO HELL. Then I hit him a few times, and we went home.   Alright, that was my day. I'm still trying to let my eyes adjust to this new prescription.

      Hot damn! Today has been odd.  Well. Got up about 9. Got in some forearm exercise...(lol, j/k.)  Otis came over for a while...we went and flew kites...he picked up on it a LOT faster than chris. By the end of the run, he knew what he was doin! He was crashing and recovering at the end...very nice. Then we rode to super cao nguyen, and otis discovered the goodness of passion fruit green tea. Mmmm. 140 grams of sugar a bottle. tasty.

       I am jack's raging ulcer.   Holy shit. My dad is so fucking pissed. I got "D"s in english, chem., and US history. Dad sees those as "F"s. He decided that i was going to get my hair cut. Now it's fscking short. about 2 inches. compared to my 5 inches of before. I dont know if i'll be going to dev's party. I dont know if i'm even going to bother living. Jesus christ. Why cant I get homework done? I just cant fscking get myself to do it. I dont know why. I just cant make myself sit down and do homework. All the teachers think that the recent downfall of my grades is because of dani (they told my dad this). NO. It's not. They sucked BEFORE i started dating dani. Assholes. He was literally screaming at me in the car. As loud as he could. Well. I dont think that i'll be playing video games, talking on aim, or doing anything that i've been doing for the past month. I'll be at digitalhistory.uh.edu studying for u.s. history. And reading my chem book. And trying to convince my dad that i'm not a miserable failure. Because that's apparently what he thinks of me.

I woke up in a dream today.  I started thinking of all of the songs and phrases I could that had the word "dream" in them, and those were the first 3 that showed up. They go together quite nicely. The references are: Linkin Park, Vincent, and John Lennon. Tell me which one's which? First one that does, gets a prize. Otis does not count for this prize. Because i told him.

      I'm probably going to get fucking bitched at about this, and i'm NOT trying to start a problem or anything, it's just that poor chuckles iss a bit out-numbered here. And i agree with him. If you dont like the rules, go the fsck away. That's what i'm doing. I have no problem with it. Homework is fucking pointless. The ONLY homework that is remotely plausable is studying. That is good. IF YOU CANT GET THE POINT ACROSS IN AN HOUR, WHY BOTHER. Give us tests, i say.Weekly tests. Tests are good. HW is bad. This isnt because i'm lazy, because i'm really not. I just completely disagree with the whole homework thing. And i'm  not saying that I purposely dont do homework, either. I'm not doing it because "it's a belief thing". I just cant do it...again, i dont know why. Homework and I just dont get along.

      Top ten reasons why computers are better than boy/girlfriends:  10. You can turn them off when you're done with them. 9. They never say, "You can't login tonight, I have a headache." 8. You can tell them anything, and they will always listen. 7. You can program them to give you the answers you want to hear. 6. They are never too tired. 5. If you come home at 3am, they don't ask where you've been. 4. They don't hog the bed and steal all the covers. 3. They don't eat (unless you count disks). 2. They remember everything you want them to remember, and forget everything you want them to forget. 1. They never complain that you don't take them anywhere.  Top ten reasons why boyfriends/girlfriends are better than computers:  10. You don't need a password to get in. 9. They won't shut down if there's a power outage. 8. It's difficult to take a computer to bed. 7. The Aide Station never gets calls asking for advice on someone's love life. 6. A computer won't laugh at your jokes. 5. You might get a few strange looks if you bring a computer to a drive-in movie. (Do they still HAVE those?) 4. When you use bad grammar on a computer, you get all sorts of nasty messages (Note: this could also hold true for boy/girl- friends if one happens to be an English major, but not generally). 3. Computers don't give back-rubs. 2. You can't put your freezing feet on a computer's leg to warm them up. [Well, you could, but: 1) they wouldn't get very warm, and 2) you wouldn't have the pleasure of hearing the computer shriek]. 1. You can't have sex with a computer. [Again, I suppose you could, but it might be dangerous...]   I dont know, i'm goin with the first one, but you can make up your own minds.

Go to penn...(probably not.) 3. Do something with dani. (This would be my choice.) 4. Fly my kite. (Meh, could be fun. It'd be more fun with someone else, though.) 5. Exercise my forearm. (lol, j/k.)  Uhm. Sleep time. I'll ponder this for an hour or so.   [cure for the itch]

      Ayeaiyai! FF:CC is teh pimp. But the assclowns (I.E. = Adam/Eric/Justin) dont seem to get the picture that you need to give the good healer (me) items and stuff to keep them happy. otherwise, they let you die. he he he. And they also dont get the picture that you need to combine spells to get better spells. I.E. Life + Fire = Holy.  Cure + Cure = Curega.  [Confused? Call 525-2477 for free myrhh]

      Guess what, guys and gals? It's story time!  There once was a tiger-striped cat. This cat died a million deaths, and lived a million lives and was owned by many different people he didn't really care for. This cat wasn't afraid to die. Then, one day this cat became a stray cat, which meant it was free and he met a white, female cat and the two of them spent their days together happily. Well, years past and the white cat grew weak and died of old age. The tiger stripped cat cried a million times, then he died too, except this time, he didn't come back to life.  - Spike  There once was a little girl who was very lonely. This little girl was given a puppy by her parents. The little girl fawned over the puppy, giving it many toys and treats. Weeks later, the little girl got bored with the puppy, and cast it aside. The puppy cryed, and cryed, but the little girl wouldnt ever pay attention to it...  - Me  How does the story end? Only time will tell.

      Damn, i'm in a ranting mood tonight. Ok, wtf's with all of the "x-treme" advertising lately?!??! I.E. - x-treme jello, Corn Nuts: Corn gone BAD!, X-treme energy, Whoop-Ass energy drinks: For that extra boost of energy!, Sour Skittles - You'll pucker until you implode!!!. Ok...Why?!?! Yeah, we want to buy those bad-ass products. It makes us all feel special.  Sam - "look, bob, check out this -----, i'm a badass now!" Bob - "Duuuuuude. Sweeeeeet. I wanna tap that!" Sam - "fuck no." Bob - "I'll arm wrestle ya for it." Sam - "Hell no, cracka, i'll play ya a game of russian roulette for it." Bob - "Bitch, ya gonna be pissin leed!"  See how quickly that conversation deteriorated? That's what bad-ass marketing is doing to the poor, poor, easily influenced minds of the people of today. It needs to stop. Now. All of it. Why bother? To get the pre-pubescent teen boys in on it? I sincerely doubt that they are concerned with corn nuts. Or energy bars. Dumbasses.

      You know, i've always been the concrete person. I havn't believed in astrology since...um...ever. It doesnt make sense. At all. It's like saying "Hey, look, my cereal spoon is hot. That could mean that my mother is going to make sexual advances on the dentist today." I never have understood the human race's tendancy to find crutches for their grevious faults. Take some damn responsibility. Dont blame it on pluto. It never did anything to you. Poor planet. It's fucking cold. It's the same thing with religions. "----!!! Please help us! Our feet smell like a glass of 9 month old milk!" (---- can be replaced with jesus, buddah, fhwqbagads, mohammad, satan, god, darwin, pac-man, or any other deity under the clouds otherwise known as heaven.)  I mean, seriously, wtf would you have to be on to believe that some constellation can determine if you should ask someone out that day? "I shouldnt ask her today because my celestial alignment is opposing hers." No, your breath stinks. Take some damn tic-tacs. Dont anyone DARE say "You're just a closed-minded asshole." Look, I'm entitled to my opinion. So are you. Feel free to rant at me about this post.  In conclusion, the human race needs to shut the fuck up and take some responsibilty. Dont blame other people/things/celestial formations on your own faults.  [For all of you that were wondering, yes, there is a reason for this rant. I was reviewing some conversations i've had with a few people in the past.]

      What the hell is with feminists incessant ranting about equality? I'd say things are pretty damn fair right now as far as the US goes. Many women out there get paid more than men do. The only thing women havn't done in the us, is have one of them become the president. It will happen pretty soon. When a woman becomes president, i say that all of the feminism should stop. What are the feminist's main problems with the us of today? Let's check:  1. Strippers. Feminists hate strippers. The feminist thinks that just because the stripper is stripping, it degrades them. NO. It doesnt. They get paid REALLY well for it. You dont even have to be that GOOD of a stripper to do it! Jeez, just for jiggling your ass around for a while, you get money. Christ, i wish I could jiggle my ass around for a while to get some money. Like that's going to happen any time soon.  2. "The Glass Roof" above all business women. ...no. The only glass roof that I can see, is the presidency. Dont worry, that glass will meet it's grisly end by a louisville slugger soon.  3. Gender equality. Why there will never be absolute gender equality is because of the inherent contradictions between equality and liberty. For example, if a guy wanted to say a joke about women at work, or hung pornography in the work place, it would make the women work in an environment that may seem hostile to them. If someone at work frequently referred to women as chicks, and a woman was offended by it, the woman would then be working in a hostile environment. If a woman wants to be treated equally in the work place, then she shouldn't be offended at what guys usually talk about. I think it's unreasonable for all women to be content with whatever people do at work, and for guys to go out of their way to change their lifestyles to conform to what's politically correct. It's impossible to live your life without being offended at something. Violence, foul language, pornography, sex, religion, whatever it is, you're bound to be offended by it sooner or later. So rather than bitching about it, just deal with it and move on. Men aren't out to get women; we're not the bad guys. Besides, I'm sure that women make jokes about guys, too. I wouldnt know, because of my lack of estrogen, but, i'm pretty sure there are a pretty few jokes/shauvinist remarks about men from women. It's not like they have the inability to create them.  I'd rant more, but I want a bagel. ta ta.

      Responsiblity - My anti-drug.  ...no. If you're that stupid, that you would get stoned while you were babysitting,then you deserve to be shot. You couldnt even wait a couple of hours to take a hit on that toke. Again, the youth of the america of today is stupid. Very stupid. I cant believe that anyone would ever do something that idiotic. I wont. I have to keep on believing in my misconception that all of the people around me a virgins. I have to keep on believing that i'm not the only one that hasn't done drugs.   ok...i'm tooo tired. i need to stop before i get mopey. Why am I getting mopey?!?!? Damn you,tasty concord grapes. Let's blame EVERYTHING on everything around me. It's all my optical mouse's fault. If I didnt have it, I wouldnt want to use the computer.   Omg, i'm way too tired. I'm starting to get dyslexic.

Game companys that try to bring back dead characters. 8. Movies based on video games 9. Oklahoma. 10. Cats.  Pick one. Someone. I'll rant on it after i get back from ice skating.

      I hate goths. They all deserve to die. Every last one of them. But that's not the reason of my rant of the moment, the reason for this rant, is because 11-14 year olds of today are all little fuckups. And it's no one's faults but their own damn ingrateful selves. I'm watching some show about 11-14 year old kids talking about sex/truancy/depression/alcochol. WTF?!?!?!?!?? NO. KIDS THAT AGE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THOSE THINGS. CHRIST. Some chick just said "yeah, i first drank when i was in 5th grade. it helps you cut loose." WHAT THE HELL. NO. Kids your age should be eating candy bars, and experiencing sugar highs. WTF. I've only gotten drunk a few times. I'm in 10th grade. I didnt even THINK about alchohol in 5th grade. In 5th grade, I fell out of my desk and slammed my head into the floor. It sucked. That's all i can remember from that year. And that my teacher, mrs. skaggs, was a fat weirdo. Yeah. Earlier in the show, there was an 8th grader that had lost her virginity. NO. just, NO. DO NOT HAVE SEX AT THAT AGE. Jezus. Fuck. Cock. Shit. Ass. Gook. I'm really pissed. And i feel REALLY sheltered. VERY MUCH SO. Why havn't  I  ever experienced this peer pressure? Is it because i've always been smart, and went to different schools? Probably not. *on the show "put words to your tears, what's makin ya sad?"* CHRIST!!! FUCKING SLAP THE LITTLE BITCH. HE'S OUT DRINKING AND HAVING SEX. FOR FUCK'S SAKE. HE'S 12 YEARS OLD. YOU'RE A PISS-POOR PARENT, AND YOU DESERVE TO BE CRUCIFYED FOR YOUR HORRIBLE MISTAKE.  (Btw, i'm very sorry about the lack of proper english/gramatical skills, but...anger.)  [anger]

Don't care for me, don't cry let's say goodbye, Adieu. It's time to say goodbye, I know that in time it will just fade away, it's time to say goodbye.  I stand alone and watch you fade away like clouds high up and in the sky I'm strong and so cold as I stand alone Goodbye, so long, Adieu.  * Oh how I love you so, lost in those memories And now you've gone I feel the pain, feeling like a fool, Adieu  ** My love for you burns deep inside me, so strong Embers of times we had And now here I stand lost in a memory I see your face and smile  Diese Liebe von meinen fur mein Blutenherz....

      I'm not going ot argue the pointlessness of blogs in a blog, dev. That would be stupid and hypocritical. Let's talk about cats, and my extreme hate 4 them. Cats should all die, besides cait. Cait deserves to live, because she's my evil henchkitty. She terrorizes cats that are twice her size, and that deserves respect, f00. And her bad-ass name. Cait Sith. Nothing's better than that. Anways, cats really suck. They shit in your lawn, and then PRETEND to cover it up. You wont notice it for a while, but then it rains...That brings the smell of all 10000000 piles of cat excrement to life, and it is a bad time. Very bad time. Well, anyways, life is good. Things have been resolved, and...yeah...good times. Is anyone else going to natasha's party? Cause i dont want to go if i'll be the only one of "da krew" that shows up. That wouldnt be cool.

      Great. Just great. My dad probably has skin cancer, and my mom probably has some sort of gallbladder infection. She didnt think it was anything big, but my grandpa took her to the hospital, and it's serious. She lost 20 lbs in the past month, she's throwing up all the time, and grandma made it sound really serious. She sugar-coated it, i could tell, but i'm smarter than that. I could tell what she was trying to tell me. They're going up there on thursday,friday or saturday, and i want to go too. I told my dad, and he got angry. He said: "She hasnt been there for you. School is more important than this."  Shut the fuck up, dad. Seriously. You're a fucking asshole. My mom could be dying. I dont think that one of mr. coe's lectures is going to be that damn important. It'd be nice to see her one more time before she croaks, if she is going to.   I'm sorry for using humor, but I cant help it. It's integrated into my very being. I cant help it, at all. I guess it's a self-defense mechanism or something.   [...]

      You are  not likely  to feel particularly social today, dear Capricorn. You would be happiest at home with a good book, a good meal, and no communication from the outside world. Alas, such solitude is not always possible. You  may find  that you need to balance your need for isolation with your obligations to your colleagues. Part of your grumpiness  might be  due to a physical imbalance. Make it an early night tonight and you'll  likely  awake tomorrow with a renewed attitude.

      Sexual  You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That’s Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. It started with a little kiss, and then I got your number I called you up, and sure enough, we fell in love that summer Till your dad picked up the phone, did not say a word. Here's what he heard, You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night You were grounded from the telephone, but luckily we still had email. So I wrote you up and sure enough, you became my female. Till your dad went through the files and said we were dead. Here's what he read, You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That’s Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh!

I bought an item from him on the 20th, and he still hasnt SHIPPED IT YET. I paid him the minute after i won it. But noooo. I've sent him like 3 emails...all basically saying "Where's my game?". I bought The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition for gamecube. For those non-cool people out there, it has: Legend of Zelda, Legend of Zelda II, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Is that cool, or is that cool?!??!?!? MAJORA'S MASK. I dont know why the fsck I sold it! It was an awesome game!!!! I guess I just was a dumbass or something. Damn, i'm a nintendo fanboy.   [Hey, listen!]

      Ok, yesterday, after school, my dad and i went to my stepmom's office. on the way there, my dad decided that he didnt like traffic laws. He decided that "stoplights are stupid and pointless." It's common sense, he said, that someone should stop their car if they saw another car coming towards them. So, we made up the "Stupidity System". All other laws would be abolished but that one. There are 3 levels of this law.  I. Stupidity - I.E. Driving down the road, and cutting someone off. This would get a fine. Not punishable by death, but they could get a good spanking. II. Dumbassidity - I.E. Talking on a cell phone while driving. This would be a felony, and depending on the call, you could be sent to jail or a huge fine.  (Or, if they're being a JACKASS, then you can shoot them.) III. Idiocy - For those idiots out there, that brush their hair, eat breakfast, and talk on their cellphone, we dont do anything to them. We figure that they'll just kill themselves because they're that fucking dumb.  Only people that my dad and i have decided that are not stupid and at least semi-intelligent will be allowed to become stupidity officers. They would get free food wherever they went. And people would be required to throw money at them. Also, they all had the right to carry as much arms and munition as they wanted. And they had a "license to kill". They could kill anyone that they wanted as long as they were being a jackass. In any manner that the officer sees fit. Except for higher officers. That would be punishable by being abandoned on a tropical island in the carribbean. With no water/food.  [Work calls]

      You know what  I  want? There are a few things, but, one of them, is a zombie outbreak. I would LOVE for there to be a zombie outbreak. That would be fscking awesome. Seriously. I want a zombie outbreak. One where a few teachers become zombies, and I get to blow their heads off with a shotgun. It'd be so much fun to defend shephard mall. I would be on top of the mall, with a sniper rifle and two sawed-off shotguns. The sniper rifle for picking off any that i saw, and the two sawed-offs in case I missed one. Eat lead, zombie bitch. ka-blamo. No more zombie-head. No more zombie-head = no more zombie. It's just that easy. And dizzy's would give me free caffeine so that i could defend better. Sleeping would be done in astec, because of the fact that astec only has 2 insecure entrance points. The space place, and the front glass door. Those could be barracaded quite easily, though. and we would use many bottles of fabreeze, so that the zombies couldnt smell the people with no projectile weapons. If there WAS a "last stand" situation in the mall, i think it would be done at AOL. Seriously! Aol has very defendable positions. We could wait for a helicopter evac. And there could be a few thousand zombies assulting the place,  with about 100 people left in the building. It'd be FUN!  On another note, this morning, on the way to school, i thought of something rather odd. What if god had an orgasm? What would happen? Please, leave me a comment on what you think would happen. I think that he would accidentally negate all life in the universe.

      Well, that was interesting. I'm at home, it's about 3:50...and eric just destroyed the fan wire.  The bed's support thingi was sitting on the wire, and all of a sudden it cut through. Could be because the bed support thingi was sharp, i dont know. It exploded. It was all like *SPARK!!!!* and we were all like "OMG". And then we saw the wire. yeah, it lit up the whole room. Eric started to grab the wire, and i said "OMGWTF!!! YOU IDIOT!! UNPLUG IT FIRST." That would just make my day perfect. Watching eric be electocuted. Good times.

      Give credit where credit's due, biotches. The hanging thing was my idea. Mine.  For you non-knowing people, i suggested that we hang miss swagerty's knight from the ceiling, and leadership class did it. Cause i wouldnt have the chance to. Yah. Word to your mothers. There will be more pranks today, but i dont think any will top that. herm...what to do? I WANT to do something to stephens. He deserves it. But what? What could we do...  Here's MY ideas:  1. Get conatser to "fire" him on the basis of sexual harassment to otis chodosh. 2. Hang all of the lab stools to the ceiling. I have NO idea how we could accomplish this, because we dont have enough rope/time to do it. 3. Kill him. It wouldnt be funny, but it would be good. 4. Turn all of the tables upside-down. 5. Dont go to class. 6. Steal his chair.  ? Someone say something ?  Other pranks:  1. Dont come back after lunch. 2. Get the security guards to arrest the entire student body...they wouldnt do it, though. They hate us. 3. at 2:00,  everyone freeze. Just stop moving. Don't say a word, dont move a muscle. 4. Everyone go to the wrong class, and act emotionally hurt if they tell you to leave.

      Microsoft Invades Cuba Microsoft's plan to invade cuba and overthrow the government has succeeded. One Microsoft official said "It's a win-win situation. The US Government is happy and shuts up the DOJ while Microsoft institutes a monopoly within Cuba for everything from computer software to toilet paper. One more step closer to world domination. Heck, we could feed a whole development department for the cost of one developer's salary in the US. They may not know how to create an Operating System very well, but neither do our US developers."

      I found this on digital history while i was doing homework...  "In a single day at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, 100,000 British troops plodded across no man's land into steady machine-gun fire from German trenches a few yards away. Some 60,000 were killed or wounded. At the end of the battle, 419,654 British men were killed, missing, or wounded."  ...  Something's wrong here...  100,000 - 419, 654 = -319, 654  Where'd the 319, 654 troops come from?  were like, 1599 generations of babies born and killed in one day?!?!??!  I mean, if this were current, like last year, there probably would have been about 10,000 women in that force.  Back then, there were probably only about 200. Most of them were probably nurses....  30 x  1598.27 = 319, 654  I'm serious...if they were sending babies out on the battlefield, they must have been pretty desperate.  Let's take a moment of silence to remember the babies.  Silence is golden, so...  Babies = Silence Silence = Gold  Therefore,   Babies must be equivalent to gold.  Babies are golden?...Damn, i want to father some kids. Sounds profitable.  [Remember the babies, for they are bling.]

No personal, hurtful remarks. 2. Nothing that will embarass the other person. 3.

         That's so true. But after it says "I dont get viruses" it should say "*beeep* Hard drive erased". And the girls would spend $300 on a customer service call. to find out that they really do have a virus, and it IS going to erase their hard drive. They just wasted $300 on a service call. With no real service.  **Update**  I was told to say to change that generalization. So. Here.  1 or 2 girls would know that it was spam. IE: Dani/Diana. Maybe devin.

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day You got me in a spin but everythin' is A.OK!  Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh!

Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh!  "I believe in a thing called love" - The Darkness  That band is fscking sweet. That song reminds me of Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Solid Snake falls in love, so I think...he seems to have a thing for meryl...Although he only subliminally shows it. He hasn't said that he actually is in love with her, but i can see it. When she got shot in both knees and her elbow and was lying on the ground bleeding, he was like "GODDAMNIT!!" and he was beating the wall. 'Cause he couldnt go save her, because he would have gotten shot in the head by Sniper Wolf. That chick is one hell of a sniper. Seriously. If  I  wasn't such a kick-ass sniper, then she would have pwnzed me. But i'm better. Ibelieveinathingcalledlove, JUSTlistentotherhythmofmyhearrrt.

HAHAHAHAAHAHHHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH.  It feel so great to have my homework done for once. I think i'll gloat again.  HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH.  I'm on the outside, i'm looking in. I can see through you, see your true colors, cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me.

No one has their work done, yet everyone slacks off. Could this be the reason why everyone has bad grades? I think so.  *note*  I KNOW that dani's computer broke. So i'm not blaming her. Her computer is teh sux0rz. Sides,  she's working right now. Mowhoahahhaaha. She doesnt know that she's being WATCHED AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME!!!!!  *nother note*  I beat Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. My conclusion is...it's the greatest fucking action game ever. Adam and I are having a heated debate over who would win in a fight. Solid Snake, or Sam Fisher. I'm saying that Snake would win, Adam's saying that Fisher would win. DUH. Snake would fucking pwnz fisher's ass. Snake can dodge bullets. Can fisher? NO. Can Fisher flip out and kill everything around him? NO. Can fisher hide in the dark? YES. But that doesnt matter!!! Snake has night-vision goggles. In conclusion, snake pwnz fisher. End of story.

If she wants to be a lesbian, and he wants to be gay, what's the problem? It's not like it personally affects  you .  Homework calls.

      www.superhornysluts has earned me 10 thousand bucks.  Well. I'm bored. And tired. Adam was being a fucker last night. It was 10:30, and for some odd reason, i was sleepy. So, i asked adam to put on headphones,  because he was playing Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. I wasnt going to ask him to stop, because even I wouldn't have stopped playing. But, he mocked me. "blahbhabhaha!" in that stupid sassy tone. I asked again, he sassed again. I gave up, because i knew that i could get him back later.  My dad came in at like 11:00, because HE could hear it, too. Everyone that has been to my house, my door was closed, and HIS door was closed. That's how loud it was. It wasn't me just being an ass. It was adam always having to make it be "his way". Adam STILL wouldn't turn it down. My dad walked away, because he would have beat the shit out of adam, and no one wants that. He stopped playing at about 11:30. Fucker. He said "You dont always get it your way, nick." ...i never get my way. Adam's always has it his way. Always. Maybe i'll put a password on the comp tomorrow. That'd be nice.  Better yet, i'll give him a guest account. And the password will be "dumbfuck". Meh, he wont even see it coming. I really dont care what the folks do. It's my computer. I'll do whatever the fsck i want to do with it. He'll take away the xbox in revenge, i'm sure. Do i care? no. I have Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. I havnt beat it on easy or hard yet. I'll do that. Maybe the little ass will decide that he'll spend some money, for once. he's the biggest cheapskate ever. He has about $500. For some reason, he doesnt ever spend it on anything. He constantly complains about the headset for the xbox, and yet he wont go spend the $20 for a new one.   Adam is an ass. He will pay for his crimes. ph33r m4 wr4th.

      DUDEE!! I just found my florescent jellyfish cd!!! IT'S AWESOME.   Side Note:  It seems as though the fabric of astecian aim-attendance is held together by me. When i get offline, everyone gets offline. I broke it. MowhoahahHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH. Jeez I was only gone for what, 20 minutes?  Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check it out I'm in line behind a barbizon And she really looks like one She says "Hi, I'm skin," And shows a whole lot But doesn't seem to have a whole lot Within, I'm small talk Blah, blah, blah, blah about the weather and all Because I'd love to stand here Another year, winter, spring, summer, fall Into pieces it pleases the eye It's nice to know that there are problems outside of my own I feel better, better Move to ten items or less Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her? Sure, I guess I'm close to checkout, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest." I'm close to checkout, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said, "Yes, and that's a promise!" "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest I have five items in the waiting asylum Take everybody's burdens, let's pile 'em up On the counter, call it a conveyer belt And as I look around I see a wanna-be dad using his belt On his screaming baby, a baby, oh baby The constellation on her face said he did the same to his lady Ten thousand maniacs asked the question But it's way too late, he made a lasting impression I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't so But I'm not supposed to impose family values, you know The sale of the century wasn't meant to be like this But how can you resist the madness? I'm so glad it's almost my turn Only one lady away from the freedom I yearn for But before you get excited, She's gotta check the writing, I'm sorry to announce that the check is gonna bounce I feel better, better Move to ten items or less Should I let her, let her, let her me in front of her? Sure I guess I'm at the checkout She asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest." I'm at the checkout, She asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said, "Yes, and that's a promise." "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Honestly, We are moderately moving Situation slowly is improving I find the Percy Faith on the P.A. Is sort of soothing Collect my change and I jet Then I'm cruising Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check it out Wandering around looking for my car I'm amazed at the maze Who even knows where you are? Who knows why that's a cart resting in the dent it made? Another car waiting for our places to trade I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't so I wish I was in the distance and heading to home base And now the race to red lights begin When the convertible girl slows down to let me in I feel better, better, like as if I was blessed Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her? Sure, I guess I roll down the window, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest" I roll down the window, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "Yes, and that's a promise!" "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest  "Are you the walrus" - Furthermore  This song is teh r0x0rz. Even if it takes me back to the good old days (sarcasm) of cha. It's just a feel-good cd. And melting vinyl makes one's head hurt. And i've REALLY got to show it to mr. stephens. He'd rock out to it.

      Great. 2 hours REPHRASING A GOD DAMN PAPER. If I dont make somewhere near a 90% on this thing, i'm going to flip my lid. I'm serious. Every god damn student at astec puts in hours of homework, on one or two assignments, and we get SHIT for grades. We all deserve "A"s for sheer EFFORT. I mean, wtf? We do exactly as they tell us, and we get horrible grades on them. Maybe it's not us? Did you self-righteous fuckers ever think of that? We try, god damnit. I TRY. I dont know if everyone tries as hard as I, but, damnit. I deserve an A for effort. The only class that I fully understand is Geometry. I have a 78 in there. And you know what? 9th graders understand that damn class better than i do. Swagerty's been being a bitch to me lately. Coe trys, but he cant teach worth shit without any textbooks. That's not his fault. That's deskin and her 5 car's fault. Christ. You do not need 5 cars. You do not need a Z3 when your damn school has the funding of a brothel in an amish community. I'm probably going to get something near a 60 on this retest. You know why? Because effort doesn't matter. All that matters, is sheer genetic luck. If you are born with the proverbial "smarts", you succeed in life. If you are born with the intelligence of a stump, you'll end up with a job flipping burgers until you are 50-70 when you decide to start leeching the government for money. Then your salary will double, because apparantly, uncle sam is the wallet of the entire fucking nation.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and have a nice night.  Fuckers.     Crawling in my skin without a sense of confidence...consuming, confusing....crawling in my skin, without a sence of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take...there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface...Consuming, confusing..this lack of self-control, I fear is never ending..controlling, I can't seem to find myself again...My walls are closing in...without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take I've felt this way before So insecure...

      I had a long rant...now it's gone. Fucking sbc dsl. It was basically about how much i hate myself right now. And astec. And most of the people there. Life sucks, love sucks, i wish the dying part would come sooner. I'm not going to kill myself. Don't worry. Suicide is entirely selfish.  I actually tried, for once, to get my assignments in on time, and, i get worse grades. Damnit. I just dont understand. Every day, i feel more ignorant than the one before.  Yet, i put on a good face, and pretend that life's grand, and try to cheer everyone else up that is around me. I want to go to classen, but, my grades suck too much. I could  try  to get in on drama or tenor sax...but i dont want to go there for vpa. I'm not an artsy person. I would LOVE to learn how to play a few bebop songs on the tenor sax though...  I'm going to stop whining now. I hate it when i whine. I hate it when anyone whines. I'm the type of person that doesn't believe in whining. I believe that everything can be changed. My belief system is crumbling. Everything that i thought i knew, is wrong. All wrong. I guess i'll go try to make up a test, to make a worse grade than before, obviously. Meh, figures. I was just starting to feel good about myself, too. What with (thinking) that i had good grades, (thinking) that my father actually liked me for once.  All that is gone now. I feel like shit. I feel like a worthless pimple on the ass of society.   [Standing in line to see the show tonight, and there's a light on....heavy glow....by the way, i tried to say i'd be there, waiting for....Dani's the girl who's singing songs to me, beneath the marquee, of our souls, by the way, i'd try to say i'd be there...waiting for....you....]

      You guys HAVE to answer this question.  What's better? Making out, or french kissing?  In case you don't know, i'll define them.  Making Out - A lot of kisses  French Kissing - A really long kiss with tongue.  I'm not being a pervert, honestly! I just want to know. Humor me.   Leave a comment.

      Khrushchev just wanted to go to disneyland. Why wouldnt they let him go to disneyland? He knew that he was risking his life. he just wanted to ride pirates of the carribbean,  or thunder mountain! Just that incident, if he had been allowed to enter, could have ended the cold war. The russians would have become happy if they were allowed into disneyland. Khrushchevland. heh.

      *shakes head* My sister is so silly. She tried to stop her bike with her bare FEET,  ON CONCRETE, and her bike pedal sliced into the back of one of her heels. She was in the emergency room for 5 hours, and they came to the conclusion that she ripped or tore the achilles tendon of her left heel. Silly sister. Stopping is for breaks. Not feet.

      Today, in the omgwtfbbq news:  My dad bought a Xterra. I got home like 30 minutes ago...and he just walked in and showed me some keys. I walked to the driveway, and there was a "warthog"(halo) brown xterra. It's sweet. Fuck the ptcruiser.  Dani and I went to the museum of art. It was...? Werd, yo. The cafe was the funniest part. I swear that there was white stuff floating around in my drink...And they had bread that has a concrete covering. And the people there did not want dani and i to leave. We got done...a LONG time before the check got there. an hour seems like an accurate amount of time. I went to dani's house. It was fun...except for my lack of hearing. Damn you, chel. Don't make dani make those noises. It realllllly hurts my ears. Heh. Anyways, later on, chel came over, and we watched POTC. That movie got better. I don't know how, but i think it's a decent movie now. Could be grammatically. Could be emotionally. No one knows.   Today has been the best day...all this year. I got a Mitsubishi and my dad got an Xterra.

      Apparantly, i now own a car. a white '95 mitsubishi galant. with 150,000 miles on it. Could use some work, but...it's a rice rocket. I wanted a mitsubishi. I guess someone out there likes me. My uncle just bought it. I'll have to share it with adam, but he's only 14. So, it'll be mine for a year or so.  I guess i'll fix it up this summer or somethin.     ph33r m4 jap wh33lz!!!  that's what it'll look like....  i have a car!!   VROOOOOOOM.

      Wait a minute, i'm passin out, win or lose...just like you. Far more shocking than anything i ever knew....how bout u? Ten more reasons why i'm meeting someone new, just like you. Far more shocking than anything i ever knew...right on cue *GUITAR WAIL* Cant stop, addicted to the shindig, top cop, he says i'm gonna win big, choose not the life of imitation, distant cousin to the reservation, defunkt the pistol that you paid for. (Can't stop - RHCP)  Ladiladlalalal.  I'm still on an Xterra high right now. I still havn't ridden in it. But it's fucking sweet. I SHOULD be bored. But i'm pleasantly satisfied.     "Dani's got herself a new job, but she wishes that she had the old one.  Now it seems her dreams have shattered  And all of her pretty friends have scattered, now that dani's underpaid.  Oh dani, don't go crazy."  Don't do it, dani. Don't work at wal-mart. I'll....I'll...Well, i can't think of a bad enough threat for this situation, but it will be bad. Really bad. If you work at wal-mart. There's gotta be SOMETHING else you can do. Walk out onto sunnylane, and hold up a sign that says "suck for a buck" and in little letters at the bottom put (at soul calibur II) Can you imagine the $$ you'd get? Or a "free blow" sign. and in little letters at the bottom (with the full payment of college tuition). I wouldn't mind! At least you wouldn't be working at wally world.  For the Commonwealth! Yeeeeehaaaawwww! For the Swarm! Ultor! D'ni!  If you don't understand, then you've gotta believe, there's too much of you, there's not enough of me. There's not enough of me. yeahhhhahah, whooaooaaoaoaoaoa. *guitar riff* (Not Enough - 3 Doors Down)  Well, my left pinky is starting to hurt from typing, but...yaeaahr. I want my double park season pass.   *remembers* Oh yeah, sorry about messing up your bed, dani. *remembers* That starry blanket was pretty comfy, though. *remembers* Those purple spikey things...they haunt me... *remembers* Gir and the Dog do not need to have sex. Ever. Badbadbad. I KNOW that gir's head looks like a phallic object, but you don't have to treat it as such. *remembers*  Grammatical. *remembers* That shelf kept on beating my skull. It was painful.  *remembers* "...this place is not secure." "?" "I could be sniped...from anywhere. *ducks*"   *ROCK OUT*

      Dissection = School Violence.  "Hey, you!  Dissection is gross and hurts animals. Frogs are snatched from ponds and rivers. Pigs come from slaughterhouses. Dogs and cats come from pounds and come from "free to a good home" ads.  You have the RIGHT not to dissect! Stand up for yourself and the animals and choose to refuse!  Take action! - Find out today if you have to dissect. - Let your teacher know, politely and in writing, that you will not be dissecting because you believe that dissection is cruel. Offer suggestions for alternatives, like computer simulations and models. - PETA's got your back: call or e-mail if you need help finding alternatives or just the right words to say. - Use these stickers to get the word out. (which i am...lol)  You're not alone. Thousands have refused to dissect. Who likes to dissect? "In 9th gade, in biology class, we had the usual dissection of fetal pigs, and i took the remains of that home, and kept the skeleton of it, an di started branching out to dogs and cats." said infamous serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer. Yikes! Get an A in science without the usual slice and dice. Choose to refuse, and don't settle for an F. Nobody has to die for you to get good grades. It's your right.  Yours truley,   The Frendly Anti-Dissection Brigade at PETA"  Brought to you by the People for the Eating of Tasty Animals, lol.

      Ooo...lack of long posts recently. Oh well. Just saw slc punk. it was cool. Very cool. That guy is my favorite actor. Matthew Lewaer or somethin. He's cool.   Now, since i'm too lazy to retype it, my newspaper article!  Wheeeee! Rant Time: Video Game Violence. By Nick Petschel  Ok, let me start this rant by saying this: I am an avid geek and a gamer. I love technology. I'm the guy that you see at his computer at 2 'o clock in the morning playing Unreal Tournament on his customized pc. I'm the guy that would pass up a date for a LAN party. Yeah. I'm   that   much of a loser. Yet somehow, I've still got a girlfriend and somewhat of a social life. Yep. Good times. Anyways, What really makes me mad, is when stodgy old politicians blame school shootings, murders, rapes, and stabbings on video games, more specifically, first-person shooters. Ok, look, just because the two guys that killed all of those people at columbine played quake, does not mean that all gamers are violence-prone crazies. I'm a relatively sane person, most of the time, but, when I start up a game of Savage, I'm just that, a savage. You can take all of your problems out on "Ghastly_Freak" or "ur_m0m". For me, at least, video games give me a place to vent so that I don't walk around beating people up. Video games don't get mad when you don't lend them a dollar. Video games don't give you an F on a paper you spent 4 hours creating. Video games are there when you need them, and they are easily packed away when you don't. If you get mad at a game, you can turn it off. There's nothing stopping you. Gamers are usually more sane than non-gamers. Non-gamers don’t really have a place to vent except to a friend, which can be offended, or a psychiatrist, which cost major blingage, or to a complete stranger. Most strangers get kind of freaked out when you walk up to them and say "Hi, my name's Nick. I hate my teacher/parents/boss. I want to rip out her/his spine and use it as a golf putter." Instead of doing that, you can turn on your xbox/ps2/gc/pc, double click/slip in your favorite game, and take your wrath out on the nearest object in the game. Just because you enjoy shooting birds with a desert eagle doesn't mean that you will take a shotgun to work and splatter your boss' brains all over the wall. Here are a few people that are gamers, and here is what they have to say:  Kacy Southerland - "Super Mario- The original game rocked, and you can't try to "update" an old school classic."  Will Hodgson - "Tetris is the sport of the gods!"  In conclusion, video games keep the madness off the streets. Censor our games any more, and you'll (essentially) let the crazies out. Don't be dumb. Make the right choice. Save the Lemmings.   (CHRIST that took forever to edit out all of the ' and ")

      See spot rock, yes indeed. The music wasn't exactly my type, for the most part, but i thought grits rocked, and so did pillar, and 12 stones. skillet kina bored me...and i can't remember the name of the first band for the life of me. It was rockable though. So, i did. I rocked. I jumped around. I got in a mosh. So, tomorrow, if i come to school looking like a zombie, you will all know why.

      ? blogger's pmsing, at least on MY comp... ?  anyways.  VacantSilhouette: guess what?' VacantSilhouette: last night, chris, charlie, michael, nick, me, daphne, and diana almost got dead. StormsBelle: Wha? VacantSilhouette: Ok, we were walking down military ave. on the way back to chris' house from the park (we got bored, and walked to the park at like 12:00 AM). StormsBelle: ... VacantSilhouette: This guy, all of a sudden, slammed on his breaks, got out of his car, and started screaming "DO YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM!??!?!?!" at us. VacantSilhouette: we all said "no..." in unison VacantSilhouette: and this went on for about 30 seconds, then he got back in his car. VacantSilhouette: he drove a block further, and then he SLAMMED on his breaks again, and he got out, and he screamed a lot louder, and a lot more! VacantSilhouette: the same thing! StormsBelle: wtf? StormsBelle: that's crazy.. VacantSilhouette: me, chris, michael, and chuck all responded "no sir!" VacantSilhouette: i guess he finally thought that we were telling the truth or something. VacantSilhouette: here are possible outcomes if we DIDN'T manage to make him stop his anger:  VacantSilhouette: 1. He didn't have a gun - Me, charlie, chris, michael, and nick beat the shit out of him when he attacks us. StormsBelle: lol StormsBelle: I don't wanna know the other one..  VacantSilhouette: 2. He has a gun. We all run like sissies screaming away trying not to die. StormsBelle: lol StormsBelle: never mind I did.. heh..  VacantSilhouette: 3. He has a knife. We throw diana at him. StormsBelle: LOL StormsBelle: that's horrible VacantSilhouette: okie doke. i'm too lazy to retype this, so, i'm posting it in my blog. Laziness.  charlie and i came to the conclusion that there were a few possible reasons why he did that...  1. Charlie was wearing a blue shirt. 2. Chris and Michael were wearing red shirts. 3. He was drunk. 4. He was on dope. 5. He was on dope and drunk. 6. He thought we flipped him off or something. 7. He thought that we were crazy japs and that we were trying to eat his brain.  Hold me down, aveda. Hold me down, it feels so right. All i know is what i've been told.  oh yeah, and that thingimabob on the back of michael's ear? Yeah. Chuck was trying to tackle michael, and he popped it. There was blood all over michael's neck. It was funny. I said that he should just take a knife, and cut the skin off before it formed another thingimabob. He didn't listen to me...oh well. Chuck can pop it again or something.

      69 things to do instead of being depressed  1. Play FFVII 2. Shoot yourself in the head. 3. Shoot Mr. Stephens in the head. 4. Play Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 5. Become a gamer 6. Download some pr0n. 7. Get some forearm exercise. 8. Buy kleenex. 9 Watch Chappelle's show. 10. www.sexylosers.com 11. www.buzzcomix.net 12. www.worldsex.archives.com 13. Watch Friday the 13th 14. Play Resident Evil 15. Go see van helsing on friday. 16. Watch LOTR. All of it. In a row. No more depression. 17. Make fun of the matrix: reloaded and revolutions. 18. Buy a life sized pillow of your favorite actor/actress. 19. Find a vibrating sheep of DOOM. 20. Kill Kacy Southerland if she doesn't give me the Movies of the 1920s 21. Read MT. All of it.  22. Read LG. All of it. 23. Go find "Super Senshi Soldiers" on the 'net. It is scary. Coo power rangers. 24. Steal 'fluffy' 25. Go see "godsend". that'll scare the depression right out of 'ya. 26. Watch kill bill: vol 1 and see if you can count the gallons of blood that are spilled. 27. Tell chris that *something that he believes...anything* is wrong. 28. Get in an argument with dani and/or stephen. You'll never win. It's impossible. If they thought that the nazis didn't kill any jews, and you showed them pictures of hitler chopping a jew's head off, then they would still argue. It doesn't matter if you have proof that you're right, they don't care! 29. Find a new blogskin,  because, apparantly, my blogskin is the stupid.  30. plan a robbery of nvidia 30. Forget how to count. 52. turn into a zombie. 32. eat your face. 69. 69

      'nother one bites the dust...  Correction: we have 3 kittens.  2 of them have died. Upper respiratory disease...We didn't get to em in time, and they got sick...and...yeah...We have 3 left that are healthy.  Grand total of cats that have died in the house (to my knowledge): 4  Yeah. I walked into the living room, dad was asleep, and i noticed that one of the kittens didn't seem to be breathing. I poked it....and moved it a bit...and nothin. I looked at it's chest for a minute...nothin. Conclusion: Dead as a doornail.

      Hah. despite CERTAIN people's "you need your OWN notes" yellings, i still think i did pretty damn good on that test. You know why? Because i rock. I found out that otis and i both said that the verdict was just, based on the fact that the defendant's entire arguement was destroyed when that one guy confessed to knowing about the killings. Harrrr. I win. Now all i need to do is get a decent grade on that slide thingi in chem, and i'll pass all of my classes.

      I feel better now. Got some things straightened out. Thought that someone was one of  them  but, got that cleared up. Life is good now, for the most part. Most of the new problems are being taken care of, and some of the old ones are starting to be worked out. For example, the problem of having to live with  the beast . I'm starting to educate him to the better thins of life, i.e. - Resident Evil Outbreak. We're going in on it together this weekend. And adam and i have both heard rumors from the folks of moving. To a house. With bedrooms for the both of us. Happy Day! What we all want, i think..., is for adam and i to have two BEDrooms. With perhaps nothing more than a bed, a dresser, and a closet. The two bedrooms would be like so. x()x. The "x"s would be our rooms, and the "()" would be the bathroom. The rest of the floor of the house, would be a big room with a sofa, our tv and gaming systems, and the comp. Good, no? It works. Assuming that we can have a floor...I'm not trying to be a rich mofo here, really i'm not. Top floor of the house would be adam and I's...bottom floor would be the folk's room, dad's office, victoria's office, the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen. And their respective bathrooms. Life would be good then. Very good.

      I wrote this for the newspaper...  Rant – School Uniforms By Nick Petschel  	Have you ever wondered what exactly the purpose of the uniform was? I have. It doesn't make any sense to me. People can say "it takes less time to get ready", and "it helps the non-rich kids be able to be popular because of their clothes". You know what? I don't believe that at all.  "It takes less time to get ready" No. Completely wrong. On Fridays, it takes me about 10 minutes to get ready. On Monday-Wednesday, it takes me about 15 minutes to get ready, and on Thursdays it takes me about 20 minutes to get ready. Why? Because I have to FIND the uniform. I don't have the $$ to go out and buy clothes for every day of the week. So, I have to wash them every other night. I usually end up laying it around somewhere, because I have homework to do, and I can't be bothered with clothes. On Thursdays, It takes me 20 minutes for basically the same reason, but I also have to make sure it looks decent.  "It helps the non-rich kids be able to be popular despite their financial situation". That may have been true in the 90's and 80's, but not now. You know what the "fashion" is now??!?? Grunge. Punk. You can get most of those clothes by going to a thrift store.  Now, it may just be me, but I think that the ASTEC uniform looks horrible. Grey, black, tan, and red. We all look like a bunch of losers. Idiots. I would NOT mind if ASTEC had a suit-like uniform. Guys wear suits, girls wear dresses. They look fine. They look spiffy. Our uniform makes us all look like Goths. That's another thing that makes me mad. When certain people tell other certain people that they should not wear gothic clothing. They make those people wear all black/grey the rest of the week, why not on Fridays? Our entire lives, we have been encouraged to be unique, and individual, but then, the dress code/uniform was invented. We all look the same. We all have to wear patches. You know who else made someone else wear patches? The Nazis. The Nazis made the Jews wear patches. I've heard the "it makes us be able to spot you in a crowd" excuse, too. That makes no sense. ASTEC is a small school. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone has at least SEEN everyone else. Make us all wear hats. ASTEC hats. Or, bright pink hats. You could spot someone wearing a bright pink hat in a crowd. Perhaps even easier than the grey/black uniform. Heaven forbid we go somewhere at night wearing the grey-black. Everyone would disappear!!! Another thing, have any of the uniform committee members been made to wear these atrocities?!??! We live in Oklahoma. It gets to around 100 degrees in the summer. 100 degrees + all black/grey outfit + humidity = DEATH FOR ASTEC STUDENTS. Why don't you just make our uniform all white? Oh. Wait. There was another group of people that had all white uniforms.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I rest my case. Uniforms are Silly, Pointless, Impractical, Boring, Ugly, Hot, A Hassle, A Bother, A Hindrance, and a general problem.   Viva la resistance!!!  Long, no?...yeah. Long. And hard. mm...long and hard...

      blarggh! sickie-poo. so tired. tired of having sex. just playin. That'd never happen. Unless i started to get sore. Then i'd be tired. Anyways. I'm seriously tired I slept for about 4 hours...and i'm still sleepy and i have a headache. Probably due to the fact that adam is a dumbfuck. Why now?  He left spilled milk all over the carpet in our room. It smelled like shit. He wasn't doing anything about it. When i got here, and opened the door, i almost vomited and died. I found the source of the smell, then put on ye olde gasmask and took it out. The room smells better now. goodtimes.

       Jessica sashays over to Mr. Acme's table and cuddles up behind him, pinching and rolling his cheeks as he smiles with satisfaction. After removing his handkerchief and rubbing his head playfully with it, she also works her way over to Eddie's lap. There, she reaches her fingers inside his trenchcoat, removes his fedora, seductively tantalizes him, sits on his table with her statuesque chest bursting out in front of him, leans closer to him, and pulls his necktie toward her as she finishes her song:  I'll give you something good if you tell me what movie that's from. Otis is exempt from this.

Prying eyes can't peer into my secret...I am living in an abandoned old watchtower close to the town of Goldstadt. Only my assistant is here to help me with my  experiments ...

      I'll have the link to the pictures up here in a bit, once david gets back from...wherever. I made a few backgrounds. 3...otis saw one...no one's seen the other two. I really like the pink triangle. I was listening to the song, and it struck a few chords...and i said to myself, "I've never seen any good weezer backgrounds. I'll make my own." So, i made it. I think it's pretty damn good. I might make a pink triangle blog layout...I think it'd be a big hit on blogskins. I kina zombied out once i got home, doing nothing but concentrating on psd...i'm tired...tired of school...tired of a lot of things. I really wish things were like they were last year. We were all dumbasses...and we didn't care. There wern't any "judges" like there are now. Next year will be better with most of the people gone. It'll give me a chance to concentrate on my work...i'm sorry if any of the "judges" take offense to this, but, i felt like saying it. I havn't posted anything that related to my feelings, and that's what journals are for, right? Oh well.    Let me know the truth, let me know the truth...

      Bright Eyes "Sunrise, Sunset"   Sunrise, sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Swiftly go the days. Sunrise, sunset. You wake up, then you undress. It always is the same. A sunrise and a sunset. You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain. The sunrise and the sun sets you realize and then you forget what you have been trying to retain. But everybody knows that it is all about the things that get stuck inside of your head, like the songs your roommate sings or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed. She raised her hands in the air and asked you, When was the last time you looked in the mirror? Because you have changed. Yeah, you have changed. Sunrise, sunset. You are hopeful and then you regret. The circle never breaks. With each sunrise and sunset there is a change of heart or address. Is there nothing that remains? For a sunrise or a sunset. You are manic or you're depressed. Will you ever feel ok? It's a sunrise and sunset, your lover is an actress. Did you really think she would stay? For a sunrise and sunset. You are either coming or you just left but you are always on the way. Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet. They are really just the same. To the sunrise and the sunset. The master and his servant have exactly the same fate. It's a sunrise and a sunset. From a cradle to a casket. There ain't no way to escape. The sunrise and the sunset. Hold your sadness like a puppet, just keep putting on the play. But everything you do is leading to the point where you just won't know what to do. And at that moment you may laugh but there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you. So it's true, the trick is complete. Now you have become everything you said that you never would be. You're a fool!  You're a fool! Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset. The sunrise and the sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Go home to your apartment and put the cassette in the tape deck and let that fever play. Sunrise, sunset. Where are you Arienette? Where are you Arienette?   For a sunrise or a sunset. You are manic or you're depressed. Will you ever feel ok?

      Rar! I have determined what my social stereotype is: Indie. I am indie. I am SO indie. Rock on! Listens: The Flaming Lips, The Coral, Weezer. Weezer kina fits, but fits more into geek. So i am an Indie Geek. harrr! Now all i need to do is buy some jeans, and i will be indie. rarrrrr!    i am an indie snob!      urlLink  How indie are you?  test by  urlLink ridethefader   You're just too cool for school, aren't you? You're pretty narrow minded  and opinionated with regards to music (and probably most other things  as well). But you're allowed to be, because you really  are  better  than everyone else. You take pride in obscurity.  You probably prefer vinyl too, you elitist bitch.     Biznitch. Fear my music that you havn't even heard of. *shakes fist* All the kick-ass bands? Yeah. I liked them before they were cool. Now I have to find new music, you fucktards.

      Michael is  dumb.   That's all i've got to say about that.     Fear me and my force resistance.   Reasons why he's an idiot as of now:  1. I knew that michael wouldn't resist the chance of free ice cream. So I let him have the ticket. 2. I let him convice me to go to the middle school.  3. He didn't say anything. At all. I did the talking. and I lied.

      Ok here is the deal. My good friend said that he was glad that he did not get asked to the Sadie Hawkins dance tonight. Hell Fighter said this because he thinks that our school is full of crazy weird chicks. Well for the most part he is right. But I believe that out there some where there is a very cool gal lookin for him. But hey I am sure things will get perkier for him soon.   Check out his post at the Hell Fighter Boy link. And see what he says. Bye again.

      Hola!!! Today was a good day. It is raining outside. i woulndn that rayn is a bad thing, but it is not sunny. nothing really happened except my passin most of my tests. School was normal. Nice and boring. My younger sister is havoing me run her and her friends all around town. Its crazy! Wow in writing this post i realized that these are boin. I might have to step things up a notch. maybe post a short story or something else stupiddly entertaining. But hey ya know, whatever. Or maybe i could i am super depressed and talk about killing my self in here. that would be a fun thing. not that i would ever do that. i could leave my email with the message asking for help and see if anyone trys to help. That would be fun. But then i would feel bad for the nice person who wanted to help. And i would go off in a depressed manner and kill my hamster. but then the realization that i dont have a hamster hit me and i woould become more and more depressd pushing me to the limit, over the edge, so then i would be forced to start taking all kinds of thing that just further depress poeple. At this piont i would be so depressed that if you were to put the sun inside me, its light would not show. Now that i think about, i probably should not write a post about killing because i dont want to be that depressed. Thas it. see ya later. i am gunna go kill myself.

I know that we have more than that. not that i mind any of it. sorry about the pronouns. if you can figure it out good for you. by the way make sure to read the post before this one. it will make this make more sense. bye bye

      Hello world. Saturday was awesome. I worked!!! allright that may not sound like fun but it was the best job i have ever had. I basically  got paided $10 and hour to pack up someone's house and hang out with my wonderful girlfriend. Things were great. I guess you could even say i learned to kiss Saturday. i want to go into that one but then again i dont know how. I guess its just kinda personal, although i do have to say the peopl;e house we pact has a nice Western Room, Garage, Dock Shed, Closet, and Stair Well. And the state park on 42 is a nice place. sorry inside joke. But yeah i had fun. Me and Heather went to the movie Walking Tall, it sucked. But i did have a good time, except the arm rest in the theater has a tendancy to get in the way. You know i think i like heather, and not just b/c of yesterday. She cute and fun and several other things. I know she is alot smarter and a much deeper thinker than she acts like sometimes(not that she acts in a bad way ever)She is just what i wanted. I do feel bad though b/c she paid for the snacks at the movie when that should be my job, but i will live. As for the rest of life it is just as good. School is almost out and my grades seem strong. Things seem to be cooling down with my sister and all of that though there is still a long road ahead. I need to do something with my friends now b/c we have not done anything in a long while and we need to have fun. I think stress is starting to take its toll on everyone. I was thinking on a rule they have at church, it is a no PDA rule for the youth. At first i was kinda upset about it because me and Heather would like to hug and hold hands and stuff of that nature little more. But as i thought about the no PDA i realized it was mad for a good reason. I realized Pastor made the rule b/c PDA takes your mind off of what you are really at church for, which should be god, and the same goes for youth trips, you should be there to learn and grow in god. Aslo PDA distacts others too, the silly people. Its hard to refrain from just grabbing heather and not letting go,not just b/c she is incredible, but b/c it is the only place i really get to see unless i drive forever and a day. not that i mind. i would drive forever and two days if i had to. But that is the major dilemma of the day. You know i waited 16years for yesterday, i waited 16yrs to kiss somebody and kissed somebody, i very cool somebody. And i do have to say it was worth the 16yr wait. It was really worth it. WOW is all i can say and thank you heather for yesterday. it was one of the best days of my life, though i have had many of those lately, yesterday was better than others. Sorry to ramble about yesterday but it is all i can really think about. The question that is goin through my head is the wonderment that did Heather enjoy it as much as i did. I think she did, she seemed to anyway. I hope. I bet she did. she did say i was a good kisser, that made me feel good about myself. Here is a question for ya. What makes a good kisser a good kisser.  is it something you cant descibe i feeling an emotion. Or is a good kisser good b/c of the way they kiss, the use of thier mouth and body actions. I bet it is a combination of it all. I am thinking about a new hair cut. something shorter but not short. its a sercret so dot tell. The one thing i refuse to do is sweep my bangs to one side of my face, its so ugly and i wouldnt feel put together enough. I like to be clean and put together. If i did me hair like that i dont think i would feel like me, so sorry heather im not doin it. hehe. Life is good. sorry i had to say that. its my new saying. Because right now life really is good for me at least. It seemed quick and kinda sudden me askin heather out. but i am glad, it wasnt that quick really i mean we did know each other for several weeks and we spent a weekend together on the youth trip. i guess it just seemed like it wasnt long b/c we only saw each other once a week. Although some how we have managed to fix that problem of not seein each other. its all good. i better go now my friends want to talk to me believe it or not. bye

      hello its third hour and i am supposed to be lookin at poetry. But im not. Life is just to full of better things to do than school work at the moment. One thing i would like to do is most likely not a good thing but it would be fun anyway. I was thinking it would be alot of fun to just grab the person standing next to me in the hall and just throw a big punch right to his face for no reason. Then i would grab the guy behind me and knee him in the stomach. Just as the 2nd guy started to fall i would jump up and roundhouse the guy coming at me from the opposite direction. At this point there would be 3 guys on the ground crying b/c they are to weak to put up a good fight and there friends would start to gather wanting to take me down. Then i see it. The key to my escape. The janitor is walkin by an and he has a mop. I jump up backflipping over two of the hurting guys and landing right in front of the mop. I grab it as a 6ft tall beast of a kid trys to hit me with a strong uppercut, but he misses. I take the wet mop and shove it into his face then swinging around the handle and hitting him across the cheek. the beast takes afew steps back and falls limp against the lockers. I turn to face the rest of the burly men who came to fight but they turn and run in fear. So i throw the mope to the guy against the lockers and walk off into class.

It is a good relationship, not only is she my beautiful girlfriend, but we keep things rolling in the regular friendship. THats just the way i like it. She sent me a blog she did before she ever talk to me, wow it was cool. She like predicted the future of me and her almost. Anywho I miss her during the day it stinks, its even worse is that i get to see her not very often. ok got to go. Bye Brando and Heather.

      Things are gettin better. Fri night i asked Heather to go out with me. Lets just say that relationship is awesome. Oh yah, fri night we went to the fair, it was a blast. I hung with zach, kat, and of course Heather. We did not do much really, except hang out. i wish brando could have been there. Anywho, i asked Heather out as i took her home after the fair friday night. Made for a good car trip. Lets see, saturday i drove to branson to help somebody vidoe a wedding that was fun. Then came home and met Heather and Phronsie at the fair again. Although i liked Saturday alot, although we were bored out of our minds, me and heather had a nice time. our friends were bored, while me and her were acting as a regular couple more or less. Then this morning i went to church met some indians who were very spirit filled and a lot of fun. They were doin the service this morning. I guess the rest is bliss.

      OK! today was a good day and tomarow will be better. Today we did somr play at church were they made me play Jesus, mainly b/c of my long hair. It was not to bad i rather enjoyed it. Plus the even better side of all of this was that it got me goin to a church and now i am closer to god than i ever have been. Thank the Lord. I mean it is awesome ow he worked in this. About 4 or 5 weeks ago i walk into WOW just goin to see what thoings were like. Within 5 min of that visit i had people asking m to do this and that. So i got involved and went to church often. This led to new strong christian friends who constantl reamind me of  God and is wonders. This made me keep walkin with him and day by day i gat closer to God.   Ok sorry if i bored you, but it was important to me and thats what i have thise thing for. Anywho! Tomarrow i am gion too the movies with Heather!! Cant wait!! See ya

      Hey there everyone! My internet broke for a week but good news, its back up so all you guys can read what i have to say. Nothing really happened in the time that i could not get on but i will tell all anyway. Last weekend I went on a youth tripwith my church, it was awesome. Went to Silver Dollar City in Branson,MO. Then we did some other fun stuff. Oh yeah, I made a new awesome friend that weekend too. Her name is Heather. She is pretty cool, I wont bore you with the details(not that she is boring or anything, i least i dont think so. I guess i cant type fast enough to tell you what i would like.)  Then this last week we finished the MAP testing, most boring if you ask me. Nothin else really. I was reading Hellfighter's blog and now i am worried i did something to make him think i am not his friend. I hope not b/c he will always be my friend. So if you read the Hellfighter please let me know if I did something to make you think i was not really your friend anymore.   Well Happy Easter to everone if i dont get to it tomarrow. Oh and if you read this Heather, you never said good bye last night, so i shall say it to you now , Good Bye heather. and Good bye all!

       Birthdays Suck   So today was my little brothers b-day, and OMFG, he woke every one up at 8:00 and had the whole day planned out in an email, it was REALLY FUCKING BORING, first we played basket ball(I hate sports), Then I had to go weight lifting with my dad, after that we had lucnh and went to his(my littel brothers)base ball game(which, by the way, WAS  FOUR  HOURS LONG) And then..... Never mind, it drives me insane even thinking about it, I mean if I even thought about waking my parents up and forcing them to play baseball for 2 hours they would KILL me, but my little brother is different. Any who my parents and HE are watiching Lion King One and One Half(BTY he is TWELVE, Is t just me or is that just a little old to be jumping up and down when seeing that they have the movie.) Any way I gonna go passout now, Ill be hanging out a Barnes And Nobles tomorrow so i'll blog bout that tomorrow.

       Work Work Work   Wow, yesterday was quite a day I went to my internship/ job shadow and I worked more then EVER we where trying to fix a website that pulled information form a database and showed it as a negative number, and in the end it was because of the order we called the variables we spent THREE HOURS to figure that out, So then we had to leave and I usually hitch a ride with the guy I'm interning under but he forgot that he left his car at his house which is ONE MILE from the Clarke County Tech Services building(which is where I am interning) so we ended up running to his car. It was hilarious there was me(a student with a backpack) chasing him(a teacher with a school milk in his hands). It would have made a great got milk commercial.  OH OH OH  and I finally saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and OMFG is it awesome I LOVED IT and am going to buy the DVD. But now the songs have burrowed even deeper into my head AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. But I will survive(I hope.)   Nothing intresting has happend yet today, wait thats not true, someone at my school was arrested for having a box cutter.(which he was showing off to teachers whose OBLIGATION is to report it. Can you say STUPID) He "resisted arrest" and broke a policemans hand. Thats pretty much all that happend today, at least up to now. Update L8ter

       Blogging   I just recentally looked at a blog and a question came to me, what is blogging really abour is it sharing your feelings to every one is it just stress relief is it a way to tell the world  I AM HERE , or maby another form of art or maby it's a way to tell people that even though they can't see you that you are there. Or maby its just like putting your footprint on the web.  Some people are very careful about what they say on their blog but some are not, and those who are not may hurt some people but help more people in finding what their life is really about and finding out thet the emotions that they experience are not the only ones like them that there are people who like the same things they do that they feel the same way they do.  Well there is my philosophical moment fot the week

       WEEKEND  Yeah so I went to Pittsburgh(is that how you spell it) this weekend. It's a 12 hour drive there and 11 hours back luckily I had my lovely I-Pod to entertain me, Once there I got to fly a Cessna and it was AWESOME I CAN FLY, actually I cant but when I get my license I will. Oh and I got my hair cut this weekend, It looks like a Lamas Ass, actually it's not that bad, But IT MUST BE CHANGED so I shall dye it blue and call it FLUFFY and it shall be my pet.   Also I finally an going to see The Rocky Horror Picture show, whose soundtrack has been stuck in my head for weeks and well not that it's a bad soundtrack cause If it where I wouldn't have it stuck in my head but the fact that I have random urges to sing Sweet Transvestite during school scare me because I can barely resist the urge.

Oh and today has been one of those rainy days where you feel like all depressed and stuffs, I have been feeling really stressed and pressured this semester, I have 4 classes two of which are online, and the other two are at school, I can come with Lit/Comp but Math, umm no, even though I like math, I suck at it, unless it's something like math that is needed when I am programming a Java program, oh yeah, I am working on learning JDBC(the Java database connectivity language) so that I can, well, so I can know it and say I know it, I am also trying to learn Assembly because it seems like something fun to know. Right now my list of languages to learn is(in no piticular order): Assembly, VB, ASP, SQL, C, C++, and JDBC.  Well thats all till tomorrow.

       Indi update and weekend   So I have 15 pages in my script, and I noticed that I forgot to format it, for those of you who dont know ther is a way that a scipt has to be formatted do that it's easy to read. So  I had to re write the entire script to fit the formatting, it sounds like a bad thing but it turned out to be good, there where some parts that made no sense or that where just completly random, or just sounded just plain STUPID. So I did a lot of that today. This weekend I had to do LOTS of school work, I ha behind 3 weeks in my phsycology calss and I only have 3 days of school left. Do, yeah, that will be taking up alot of my time. I am also trying to find someone who has a good camera and is willing to let my filming team to burrow it. I also have to finish the sctipt in a month so we can cast and shoot it before I go to Germany at the end of July, then there is a website that I have to help make, that will take a wile, but will be worth it($$ need i say more). But the Indo film will be my personal top o' the list project. Thats all.

And one of my personal goals is to ask her out this summer.

I bought an X-Box, which BTY used up every dollar I had(and then some). I quickly remade the money. Fixed/Built a computer for this dude for 115 bucks, and got some money from some other stuff. Bringing the grand total up to around 200. And bla bla bla bla. Ohhhhhhh I saw Chronicles Of Riddick (My friend and I had a Riddick day, Played the game saw pitch black then Chronicles.) Which was an awesome!!! IGNORE THE REVIEWS THEY ARE SOOOO F***ING WRONG!!   Umm, OH YEAH. so that Indi Film I made turend out to be a flip. Special effects and casting and otherstuff. We (Neon Productions)are making a "Mocumentary" about stupid people. The website can be found urlLink  here . This one will actually happen.  thats all for now.

I am getting a little nervous, but not a much as I expected, it will all come out at the airport, one of those delayed phsycological thingamabobbers, There was somthing about it in my Phsycology course, but I dod the whole course in two weeks so I'll be damned if I remember all of it. Or even parts of it. I hope I can get a good camera before than, or atleast get my old one fixed. I do know that I will have a computer there of fot those non existant people who actrually READ my blog there will br crazy German thoughts in English. That makes no sense now but it will soon.

       Love vs. Friendship   I just realised today the reason I have never been able to ask a girl out. Because every girl that I would consider asking out is a friend of mine. And to tell you the truth, I rather have a friend for life the a girlfriend for a few months than loose both my heart and a friend. I was really depressed for a few weeks after this girl I really liked was asked out, at first I thought "naw, I would have never had a chance". But then I tought, well se is happy, and to tell you the truth, if you really love someone you have to let go. One day I will ask a girl out. Bue when I do I want it to be the perfect girl. I dont want to get stuck with a preppy, i want to get stuck with someone who I can spend the rest of my life with. Any way if you red this far than sorry for wastign your time. But I would just like to end this by saying that the saying "Nice guys finish last." can't be more true.

      Hey all.  Some updates for you.  The 2004 Pennsylvaia State Studnet Council Conference is at one of our members high schools'.  He is a co-chair of the event.  We are working on what we can do for A's For Africa there.  We are also contacting a local radio host in the Waynesboro Area.  Her name is Delilah, she has her own program 7pm-12am Monday through Friday.  Why are we contacting her you ask, well does is astonish you that she is taking a trip to Africa herself.  Go visit her site to learn more about her trip www.radiodelilah.com.  I am working to see if she can put us on the  air or help us in anyway, like being a resource person.  Cross your fingers that she e-mails me  back and says "Yes I can help you guys"  Watch for more updates about this.

      Hello, all.  It is getting down to the end of school, the call of the summer is coming.  Remember that you can start a fundraiser this summer.  You can start one with donation jars by getting permission from a resturant owner or manager and putting it near the register.  You can also start one in your community.  Get the word out!  -Mike

      Cingulars is buying out AT&T wireless, which quite frankly is surprising, because although I understand the concept of AT&T Wireless being a sub and seperate company from AT&T, you would think AT&T was making enough cash to keep it.  They are a damned phone company after all, but Cingular is buying them, so all I have to say is that I am proud that a business can swoop in when a new craze is started (cell phones) and become so large.  They plan to add wireless hi-speed internet, too.  I know, I should link to things.  I will starting next time, I promise.

      Ice cream does not phase me so much, but I do love cake.  Even if it's out of one of those $2.99 cake mix boxes.  I reported a bug to Google about Gmail.  I feel justified in having an account now, considering this is beta and as it is, it is my duty to help better the application.  My summer plans have gone well today, as I feel my plans are going into process, such as the damned Honors work I must do.  I have discovered that when I listen to a song with a beat I like, I tend to thrust my fist towards my monitor and bang on my desk and underneath my monitor.  I've actually produced some pretty nice sounding and complicated drum beats.  Anyways, back to subject.  I've been working on the Reviuss logo.  Everyone knows it's a damn V.  But it is a very nice looking V, it doesn't look exactly like a V.  Why can't people assume it's just a neat arrow-looking object.  Accept that!  There is a good discussion going on in my forums about psychology and philosophy, finally the boards are running with . . well, some sort of intelligence.  http://rev.shadonet.com/forums

      Reviuss is getting worked on.  I want my development site, and it will be artsy, yay for that.  I am still thinking about it and contemplating things in my mind, but I am excited.  I have a new logo / image.  And when I say image, I mean image, not graphic.  I have a Gmail account now.  Extremely fast load times and VERY good use of DHTML, it makes me not hate JavaScript, in fact I will be incorporating some DHTML into Reviuss now because of it's inspiration along with Blogger.  I may be moving to Movable Type.  They have a pretty website, and it's written in Perl.  Although, since I am working on the new site, there would be no point, so never mind.  Firefox .9 is out.  I love the Mozilla Foundation to death and hope one day to start or be involved in an operation like that.  I'm pretty sure that is my dream and that is my goal and that is what I am going for, and why I started in software development in the first place.  I love software architecture and technology.  I am definitely back into the game, CS major for me!  I hope I get into MIT.  The things my mother told me were a bit depressiong and put me down.  I think that is my first goal in life, leading to my second goal.  I can only hope and pray to the Lord that he helps me accomplish this.  I really am worried.  I am going to revamp the forum.  I want talk of technology.  I realize this means I will be left with possibly approximately 4 users for the time being, but it opens the door for me inviting others without being worried they will find it immature and petty.  I think that is all for now.  Travis was right, a blog is theraputic.

      There's about to be an external server error if you don't tell me what the hell is wrong.  Yeah, don't think that fragile metal and flexiglass case will protect you.  I have a baseball bat . . .  and power tools.

      Is it just me, or do Ford and Chevy love America now-a-days?  I think their new slogans are "For every mile to the gallon, you kill that many terrorists!"  Ford is advertising with "The Great American Ford Sales Event"  And Chevy with "Chevy.  An American Revolution."  I don't get it.  Why?  What's going on with the patriotism?  I better get a damn American flag paint job when I go in.  ..I think they're losing business to the Japs.  Well, hell.  Every car company will be losing business if we don't lower the damn gas price soon!

      I like the word tidal, don't ask me why.  The line is from a Tool song, I don't remember the name but it's about Armagedon.  It should be my theme song.  I'll find the name.  The title of this post is for my mind.  I wish a tidal wave would come and wash it all away, a lot of stress has come lately from the programming thing.  I love programming, and I've been burning myself out making something that isn't needed or useful or innovative, so I'll go back to coding things I love.  I'll tell you whenever I have ideas.  A blog is just what I need, something to write.  I like journalism, and I love psychology, so soon enough I'll move this blog over to rev.shadonet.com and I'll make my own design, figure out how to add my shoutbox (which I did code, muaha, bow to my 10 lines of text input Perl script), and also add a special section for "Life Unnamed."  For now I'll just put it on rev.shadonet.com.  A lot of people like to see it.  It will be nice.  Relaxation puts me in a pretty happy mood, and I can count pretty far up who has tried to put me in a happy mood.  Finally, one person did.  Not sure how, but thank you Kaptain.  Really.  :)  Anyways people, Life Unnamed, coming soon.  Until I have a chance to get organized, visit:  http://traviswalters.sytes.net/ - Travis' site.  We are just so cool because we blog after the craze started months ago.  http://rev.shadonet.com/life.gif - A picture of me.  http://rev.shadonet.com/Miracle.html and http://rev.shadonet.com/rl.html - Two articles out of about 5-6 currently written ones for Life Unnamed.  More soon.

      I've been very into the hybrid bands.  I love Soundgarden, so of course I jumped at the chance to get the first Audioslave album (Lead singer of Soundgarden, band of Rage Against the Machine).  Good band, but they need to come into their own.  I'm sure the next album will be  very  nice.  Also, I loved the song Slither from Velvet Revolver, which is a pretty recent band, they've been together for a while touring but they FINALLY released their CD yesterday, entitled Contraband, featuring Set Me Free (theme song from the movie The Hulk) and Slither.  The lead singer is that from Stone Temple Pilots, and the band of Guns n' Roses.  Let me say, after touring these guys really have found their own.  Great band, great CD, they just sound great and have a good style of music.  Give it a listen.

      I'm neurotic about design.  So, blah.  Comment, damn you people.  I have a few ideas for the design of Life Unnamed.  What do you like?  Tidal - White, watery ish, Hawaiinish. The Map - Torn paper look, old, brown. Simple - Well, simple.  Nice use of browns, light greens, blues, and oranges.  Pretty much just text, no images.

      This is the first of a few posts that will be here, in this blog, for explanation to myself and others why Reviuss did not work, where I will be taking "Epoch", and to introduce Life Unnamed.  This blog won't be here forever, because essentially Life Unnamed is where I will be posting.  So here we go.  With the design of things, I've realized I am thinking too much like an application designer, and not like a web designer.  I want things to be too complicated when they shouldn't be, content management should be easy.  However, the application side of things, for instance the administration part, can be complicated, filled with DHTML and curvey images.  I've just recently realized this.  Also, Reviuss was a little bigger than I wanted.  I suppose I didn't really want an entire community for a development team.  Sure, I like my development team (only ONE person ever helps though, so Thank You Carlos for always being there for me, don't think that because Reviuss has changed that the concept has changed, we're still a dev. team :) )  But a community and a dev team site together--no.  Doesn't work.  And all of the time from the dev team would be being put into Reviuss and Epoch.  I want to design rich applications, using new tools like XML.  I don't want to mindlessly drone over the details of usability and then write what has been written over and over again, just a few scripts snatching articles from a database.  So, from now on, the development team (when I have my time) will be working on this.  If I want to make a community, then I should make a damned COMMUNITY, not a place to post articles.  I don't know, and I'm not getting into it right now since it's taken me over 24 hours of non-stop thought to figure out what I have so far.  I swear I'm a neurotic nutcase.  So, in a sense this is still Epoch.  I am still making a site for me to post day-to-day gruff, articles, and keep it all in tact.  Of course, I will work on this little by little not to burn myself out.  I'll be going for my look here, I'll be going for a stylesheet template here, my pretty, simple, XML.  My nice features.  And I'll make the admin part as pretty and Javascripty as I want!  Like Blogger, I like Blogger's DHTML.  Life Unnamed, well that is basically the name of the site.  Anyone remember Subject to Ruin?  I write a lot of articles, you've seen them probably, and I know many at my school love them, they want them in a book.  So I've decided to organize them and put them into collections, Life Unnamed is that collection, along with every day blog stuff, and probably eventually other things.  But while I make this, this...this is my home.
